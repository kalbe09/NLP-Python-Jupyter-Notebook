Notifying staff of new incidents;Answer ID 1;Can I receive an email when users have requested help and an incident is created?;['Answer ID 7880', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Staff Notifications;"  Incident Assigned Notification The Incident Assigned notification notifies staff members when new incidents are assigned to them. The Â Incident Assigned message is a notification that displays in the Notifications section of the Communication Center. Each staff member's account can be configured to send an email notification to the staff member when the staff member is not logged in to Oracle B2C Service. That is, if the staff member is not logged in and an incident is assigned to them, the staff member can receive an email in their Inbox informing them that a notification has been sent to them and that they should log in to determine what action needs to be done regarding that incident. To configure a staff account to send an email notification to an Inbox when the staff member is not logged in to Oracle B2C Service, use the steps below: Click the Configuration button and select Staff Management Open either the 'Staff Accounts by Group', 'Staff Accounts by Manager' or 'Staff Accounts by Profile' reports and double click the Staff Account you would like to edit. On the Staff Account details, select the appropriate Email Notification. Â  Â To send an email for every event that triggers a notification, select the 'Detailed Notification Always' option. Â  Â  Click Save  To enable the Incident Assigned message: use the steps below: From the Common Administration items, select Communication Configuration &gt; Message Templates. In the left-hand frame, right click on the interface name and select Edit. From the top ribbon, Â select Administrator Notifications, make sure the check box is enabled for the Incident Assigned message. Click Deploy and then Save &amp; Close.  For additional information on deploy changes made to message templates, refer to Answer ID 7880: Message Templates are not getting deployed and saved.  Send Email to Non-Assigned Staff Members If you would like to be notified of new incidents and are not the staff member to whom the incidents are assigned, you can use a business rule to email the incident information to you when the incident is created. The Email Incident Notification message must be enabled in the Message Templates Â table. Use the steps below to create a business rule that emails the incident information: Click on the Configuration button and select Site Configuration and then Rules. Click the Incident button in the ribbon and then click the Edit button in the ribbon. In the left frame, right click on the incident state that is the initial state and select New Rule. In the right frame, configure the rule: Enter the Rule Name then select 'Incident' in the Add IF Condition Based On drop-down menu IF section: Â  Â specify which incidents to be notified of THEN section: click the drop-down arrow next to Add Action and select Email, then Email Incident Information Include whatever other actions are appropriate Click Save Position the rule appropriately within the rule list. Compile and activate the rule set. Submit a test incident to verify your rules are working correctly.

Automatically assigning incidents to staff members;Answer ID 9;Is there a way of assigning incoming incidents automatically to staff members?;['Answer ID 2205', 'Answer ID 1041', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Business Rules, All versions; The rules feature of Oracle B2C Service allows you to assign incidents from incoming assistance requests to specific staff members. The routing criteria may be assigned based on the email address, specific contents of the assistance request, or specific contact or organization information. For Â information on best practices for configuring rules, refer to Answer ID 2205: Best Practices for Setting up Incident Rules. Configuring the rule: Each rule consists of two primary sections. The IF section defines criteria that must be met in order for the rule to act upon the incident. The THEN section defines the actions that are executed on the newly created incident, including assigning the incident to a specific staff member. You can have several IF conditions within a single rule. The THEN part of the rule includes the action that assigns the incident to specified group or staff member. Â You should also include an action to transition the rule to another state. You can edit the Logical Expression field to specify an OR relationship between conditions. For more information on using logical expressions, refer to Answer ID 1041: Using the Logical Expression Feature. A single business rule can also perform more than one action. For instance, you can use a business rule to assign an incident to a staff member, assign the Product, Category, Custom field or Status, respond to the incident and send a copy of the incident to other staff members. For more information on setting up business rules, refer to the 'Business Rules Management' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Sending incident responses to more than one email address;Answer ID 17;Can I enter both the original contact, as well as the main supportÃ‚Â addresses in the contact email address field?;['Answer ID 1972'];  Incident response messages, All versions;" When sending responses, the contact email address field should have only a single address in it. When editing an incident, you can enter additional email addresses in the CC  Â or Â  BCC field. The response is sent to all email addresses specified in those fields for that specific response. If you send a response later, you will need to re-add those addresses if you wish to copy the recipient again on a future response. To do this, click the Options button to display the BCC field and Â CC field. You must select the Show BCC check box and Show CC check box on the Options window. The fields will show up once you click the Send on Save button. Refer to Answer ID 1972: Using the CC or BCC field with an incident response.  Adding secondary contacts to an incident Any contact record in your site can be added to the incident as a secondary contact. The secondary contact does not have to belong to the same organization record as the primary. To add a secondary contact, using the default workspace configuration, open the incident, click the Contacts tab and Â look for the Contacts sub-tab. Select Add New to add a new contact record or Add Existing to search for and select an existing contact record. All contacts listed in that section will receive any response sent for that incident since they are either the primary contact or is a secondary contact  Â  Adding a custom field for an alternate email address To allow end-users the ability to enter additional email addresses for incidents, you could create a custom incident field named alternateemail that allows users to specify an email address to be copied on when a response is sent. Â  In this case, the email address listed in the alternateemail field Â would be Â added to the CC: field when the response is sent. If this field is set up to allow end-users to edit the field, it will appear on the Ask a Question page and end-users will have the option of specifying additional addresses to receive copies of responses for the incident they are submitting. To create the alternateemail custom incident field, use the steps below: Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. Double-click Custom Fields under Database. Â  Select Â Incident under the Custom Â Fields tree. Click the New button on the ribbon. Â  Type Â the name you want to give your custom field Â in the Name text box. For example, Alternate Email. Click the Data Type drop-down and select Text Field. Â  Enter information for each field using Â the specifications Â below. Column Name: alternateemail Default value: Leave blankUsage: Plain Text (Note: the Email Address option automatically sets the size of field to 80) Size of Field: Size of your choice, 255 is the max Required fields: Leave check box unchecked Interface Visibility: Check the Administration Display and Administration Edit check boxes. If you wish to allow end-users to access this field, check the End User Display and End User Edit check boxes. Click the Save button on the ribbon.  Note: When creating this custom field, you can specify the size to be any numerical value up to 255 characters. Any characters exceeding the length you specify will be truncated when the incident is saved. As a result, if a list of several email addresses is entered, the last email may only be partially saved and incident responses cannot be sent to the truncated email address. If a custom field with this name has been configured, Â Service will email a copy of the responses Â in the incident to the email address that is listed in the field.  Â  Sending copies of all responses to someone To send copies of all responses to an individual, you can set up a rule. You would not need to use the alternateemail custom field to do this. An example of this type of rule is: For the appropriate state: IF appropriate conditions of your choosing here THEN Email &gt; Email Incident Information &gt; indicate recipient"

Default incident and answer statuses;Answer ID 48;How do the default incident and answer statuses work?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Statuses, Customizable Menus Oracle B2C Service;"  Within Oracle B2C Service, there are system-defined statuses for both incidents and answers. Incident statuses are used to indicate whether the incident is still open or if the incident has been resolved. Answer statuses deal with whether the answer is published to the end-user pages or is still private and unavailable to your end-users.  Incident Statuses  When working with incidents, Oracle B2C Service has four system-defined incident statuses: Unresolved, Updated, Waiting, and Solved. In addition, each status is a specific status type: Unresolved, Waiting, or Solved. It is not possible to delete any of the system-defined statuses. Â  It is also not possible to change the status type associated with the four system-defined statuses. Â  That is, you cannot change the Updated status to be a Waiting status type. Adding custom incident statuses: Within your site, you can create custom statuses for additional classification options. However, each of the custom statuses that you define must be set to one of the three status types. To add a custom incident status:  Select Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Customizable Menus &gt; Incident Statuses Â  Â   When adding custom statuses, you can only specify the status type when you first create the custom status. Â  Once the custom status is saved, you can no longer change the Â status type. If you determine that a custom status should have a different status type, you can create a new custom status associated with the correct status Â type and then search for and reassign the incidents to your new status. Â  Then, you can delete the old custom status. Â  Note: Â  If you delete a custom incident status any incidents associated with that status will revert back to the default status of the same status type. Â  Â For example, if you delete a custom status that is a waiting status type, all incidents associated with that status will revert to Waiting status. Â  Â It is recommended to confirm there are no incidents associated with the status you want to delete before you delete it. The default incident statuses are described below:        Unresolved: This is the default status for new incidents submitted through the application, for example incidents submitted from the Ask a Question page or via email. This indicates that the incident has been created. The status type is Unresolved. Â            Updated: This is the default status for existing incidents that have been updated by the customer, either to add more content to the initial incident that is still unresolved or when the customer updates an incident based on a request from a staff member. Incidents updated by other staff members do not automatically change to an Updated status. The status type is Unresolved. Â            Waiting: This status indicates that a staff member has responded to the incident and believes the answer will resolve the issue. If the end-user does not update the incident within 48 hours (by default), the incident status automatically changes to Solved. The status type is Waiting. Â            Solved: This status indicates that the issue has been resolved and no further action is necessary. The incident remains in the system for historical purposes. Incidents can be set to Solved manually or the system will change the status of Waiting incidents to Solved based on the values of the CI_HOURS and CI_WAITING_CALC_DAYS configuration settings. The status type is Solved.        Customizing default statuses: Within Oracle B2C Service, you have the ability to edit the names of the default statuses. However, notice that the status types are grayed out. As a result, regardless of how you rename a default status, it will always function based on the status type assigned. For this reason, do not rename default statuses to coincide with a different status type. Instead, create a new custom status and set the appropriate status type when you create the custom status.  Unresolved status types: Typically, when working with incidents from your administration pages, there is at least one view that lists the incidents with an Unresolved status type. This type of view would include incidents that have an Unresolved status or an Updated status as well as incidents assigned to custom statuses with an unresolved status type. This allows staff members to easily view open incidents that need to be worked. Status types are most useful for allowing you to group incidents with different, but similar, statuses together. Reports often use filters based on the status type so that all incidents with an unresolved status type are included in a report. Similarly, a report might include all incidents set to a solved status type within a specific time frame, such as the last week or month. Statuses allow for greater classification within your application, while status types allow the system to act on incidents in a consistent manner. A typical incident may change statuses as follows based on end-user and staff activity:  The end-user submits an incident from the Ask a Question form. The status is set to Unresolved. Â    A staff member replies to incident and sets status to Waiting. Â    The end-user replies to the incident to provide some additional information. Status is automatically set to Updated. Â    The staff member replies again to address additional information and sets status to Waiting. Â  Â    The end-user is satisfied with response. At this point, the end-user can set the status to Solved from the Account - Questions page. Otherwise, after the time specified in the CI_HOURS configuration setting has passed, the incident automatically changes from Waiting to Solved.  Within your business processes, you must determine when incidents should be set to which statuses (including custom statuses) and then train your agents when to use which status values when they send responses. For additional information, refer to the 'Add or Edit Incident Statuses' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.   Answer Statuses  With Oracle B2C Service, there are four default answer statuses (Public, Private, Proposed, and Review) and two status types (Public and Private). By default, the Private, Proposed, and Review statuses are a private status type, which means they are not visible on the end-user pages. Only answers that are set to a status that has a public status type are eligible to be viewed from the end-user pages. Note: Just because an answer is assigned to a public status type does not mean it is viewable on the end-user pages. Answers used with privileged access are set to a public status type, but the access level may be set to a privileged level that not all users can access. Similarly, an answer may be assigned to a product and/or category that is not visible to the end-user pages and the answer would not display on the end-user pages. You cannot delete any of the four default answer statuses. You can change the status type of the Review status so that it is a public status type. Â  You cannot modify the status type of the Proposed, Private, or Public statuses. Adding custom answer statuses: Â  Within the application, you can create additional custom answer statuses that you need. Each custom status must be set to be either a public or private status type. Custom statuses allow you to classify answers into more specific statuses, while the status type specifies whether the answer is eligible to be viewed from the end-user pages. To add a custom answer status:  Select Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Customizable Menus &gt; Answer Statuses  When working with answers, the system-defined answer statuses are:        Private: This is the default status for new answers manually created from the administrative pages. In addition, new answers default to the Everyone access level. The status type is private. Answers assigned to private cannot be viewed from the end-user pages, regardless of the access level and product and category visibility for the answer. Â            Proposed: Answers that are newly proposed from an incident (by clicking the Proposed button when editing or viewing an incident) have a Proposed status by default. This is a private status type. Â            Public: This is the default status that allows answers to be viewable to all end-users or to privileged access users. The status type is public. Â            Review: If the AR_DATE_ENABLE or AR_AUTO_ENABLE are set to yes, answers may automatically be updated and have their status changed to review. The AR_DATE_ENABLE setting allows you to set a specific review date for the answer, at which time the status changes to Review from whatever status it is set to. With AR_AUTO_ENABLE set to yes , the application automatically sets the answer's status to Review if the score of the answer is decreased over time (due to lack of use) to be zero. By default, the Review status is a private status type.        Within your business processes, you must determine whether additional custom answer statuses are warranted and when answers should be assigned to which status. For additional information, refer to the 'Add or Edit Answer Statuses' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Using HTML in an answer in 18A and newer;Answer ID 55;How do I enter HTML into an answer so that it renders when viewed from the end-user pages?;['Answer ID 10205', 'Answer ID 5168'];   HTMLÃ‚Â Answer Content Oracle B2C Service, version 18A and newer;"  When working with answers, the HTML editor is always enabled for use. Â  For the Question and Answer tabs of an answer, you can click the Source button Â to toggle between the HTML editor and the underlying source HTML code. Note: Access to the Design and Source modes can be enabled/disabled at the profile level. Â Assign Service Permissions Â for more information. In the design mode, you can create dynamic, well-formatted answers without previous HTML experience. You can include special formatting in your text and add graphics, links, and other HTML features. The HTML is written automatically as each option is added. For more information on the various options in the answer editor toolbar, refer to Â Answer Editor Features. Using source mode (select the Source button), you can create answers using HTML source code. In version 19A and newer, the editor displays your code in colored text to indicate structure and syntax. Note:  Â If you put code into the answer solution source mode that has an html head and/or body tags in it, you will receive the message: ""Solution. Â  Â You cannot save answer content as a full HTML document. Â  Â Either remove HTML tags manually or switch to Graphical mode for automatic cleaning."" This is because the answer HTML will be embedded on a page that already contains the html, head and body tags. Therefore, to have these tags also in the solution would cause 2 copies of these tags to be included in the page source. This can cause display problems and is a security risk. To save the answer, select the Source button again to return to design mode and these tags will automatically be removed. You can also manually remove the html, head and body tags from the source mode. For additional information, refer to the 'Adding HTML Answers' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Note: Oracle B2C Service Technical Support staff do not provide support for HTML coding issues. For assistance with HTML issues specific to your site, please consult the Webmaster for your site.  If it is determined that the site customization has resulted in a loss of system functionality, Oracle B2C Service will assist users, without charge, to restore their system to the initial installed configuration. Any additional assistance may, at Oracle B2C Service's discretion, be provided by our Oracle Consulting group subject to standard consulting fees."

Searching for answers with links to other pages;Answer ID 72;Is there a way to find or search for the answers that will be affected when those target pages are moved?;['Answer ID 307'];   Answers, Analytics  Issue   We have published several answers that include links to other web pages in our site. We would like toÃ‚Â findÃ‚Â the answers that will be affected when those target pages are moved.;"  The best solution to find all answers that contain a specific URL/target is by using the search feature to search the contents of your answers. Since each word within an answer is keyword indexed, you can do a keyword search on the text that you use to have the customer access that URL. Â  Â That is, search on the text that is used in the link itself. The results will bring back all of the answers with that URL in it, you can then edit each answer and make the proper corrections to the URL. Note: a URL that begins with ""https://"" will not be indexed and therefore will not be included in search results. If you use the &lt;answer_xref id=""y"" /&gt; format Â to link to other answers, there is no current means to search for all answers that include a link using these formats. For example, searching on ""answer_xref"" does not return all affected answers. Â   Custom report: Â You can create a custom report that lists the contents of your answers. Then, export the contents and evaluate the contents in another application. For example, you can export the data into Excel or similar application and set up filters to list which answers contain ""answer_xref"". For more information on creating a custom report with answer content in it, refer to Answer ID 307: Printing and Reporting All Public Answers  Â  Keywords: For this situation, however, you might consider adding a special keyword to the answer, such as ""extlink"" for an external link or ""intlink"" for a link to another answer. With this approach, the extlink or intlink will be indexed when the answer is saved and when you search on one of those words, you can view the list of answers that have an internal or external link.  Custom field: Another approach is to create a custom answer field for the type of link included in the answer. For example, you could create a custom menu field named Included Links with the following menu items listed: No Link, Other Answer, Other URL, and Both Answer and URL. In this way, you can search for your answers by how the custom field is set."

Exporting reports into another format for analysis;Answer ID 75;Can I export reports from Oracle B2C Service into another format for analysis?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Exporting Report Data Oracle RightNow Analytics Cloud Service;  It is possible to export report information from Â the Oracle B2C Service application into a format that can be used in other analysis software. Data from both custom reports and standard reports can be exported. You are able Â to export more than the first page up to 100,000 rows, however, this ability is not available if the report is queued. You can only export one level of data at a time. That is, if your report includes multiple drill-down levels, you will only export data for the level that you are viewing. The export function does not automatically export all data for all levels and options in the report.    To export data from a report, Â use the steps below:  Generate the report of interest.   From the tool bar, click the Report tab.   Click the Export button.   Select the appropriate format: Â HTML, PDF, Excel, Â XML, Image, Clipboard Â or Delimited. Â   Â  Note: Â  In order to export to Excel, you must have Excel 2003 or later releases, Â due to a change in design that takes advantage of XML parsing that is available in Excel 2003 or later releases.   When you select an option, the Export Options window allows you to specify where the exported file is saved and the opportunity to launch the application associated with that file.  Notes: Â  Â  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Â  Exporting to HTML: When you select HTML, selecting relative formatting will create a report that will display correctly most often due to browser support, while absolute formatting will be more precise when the viewer uses a browser that supports that type of formatting. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Â  Exporing to Excel: When exporting in this format, the version of Microsoft Excel installed on your workstation is automatically checked and the report is exported as an .xls or .xlsx file depending on the version. When exporting a report with text areas to Excel, it is difficult to determine where to place the text fields. This is because the Oracle B2C Service Analytics engine records the location of the text area with absolute positioning (for example, we might place the upper left corner of a text field at the 13th pixel from the left and the 42nd pixel from the top) however Excel will only allow us to specify which cell in the grid we should place the text in. Therefore, although we do our best to try and place the text appropriately, it may not be placed in the same position that it was in the report. If you would like to see the text areas exactly as you have entered them in the report, you must export the report to a format Â  Â that supports absolute positioning (such as HTML).  For additional information, refer to the 'Export report and dashboard data' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Using 'OR' logic with business rules;Answer ID 84;Can I use OR functionality for menu items when I create business rules for incidents?;['Answer ID 1041', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;"  You can create rules that use OR criteria within the rule. This includes both selecting multiple items from a drop-down menu (product 1 OR product 2 OR product 5) and specifying an OR relationship between two separate fields entirely, such as if the incident contains specific text in the summary OR if the incident is assigned to category 3.  Multiple Criteria for Drop-down Menus  You can create rules that allow for multiple criteria when using a menu field in the IF part of the rule. This allows you to route or escalate Â records for multiple items listed within the specific drop-down menu options. For example, you could set up a rule to route Ask a Question Â incidents to a particular group if the submittal was set to category 1 OR category 2 OR category 5. When setting up the rule, click the Add Condition Based On button and select the appropriate field. A box listing all menu options appears. Use the Control key to select multiple items or the Shift key to select a range of items. If using the product or category field, check the appropriate boxes to set the criteria of interest. If you have sub-products or sub-categories defined, you can expand the sub-items to select specific values individually.  Between Individual Criteria Listed  You can also define OR criteria between the individual criteria listed in the IF part of the rule using the Logical Expression field. Note: Logical expressions are Â also used with custom reports. For more information on logical expressions, refer to Answer 1041: Using the Logical Expression Feature. For example, you might want to route incidents to a specific group if the product field is set to Product A OR if the category is set to Category 3. To do this you would set up the IF part of the rule as defined below: IF 1. Incident.Product equals Product A 2. Incident.Category equals Category 3 Logical Expression: 1 | 2   Use of Parentheses  Within the logical expression string, the use of parentheses is very important. If no parentheses are included, the criteria are evaluated solely by the order listed in the Logical Expression box. For example, there is a significant difference between expressions A and B below:        Expression A: 1 &amp; (2 | 3)       Expression B: 1 &amp; 2 | 3     Without parentheses, comparisons are made strictly by the order the criteria are listed. As a result, the expression 1 &amp; 2 | 3 corresponds to (1 &amp; 2) | 3.  With expression A, an item matches if criteria 1 is met Â AND either criteria 2 or 3 is met. Â  No matter what, criteria 1 must be met. Â    With expression B, an item matches if criteria 1 and 2 are met OR if criteria 3 is met. If criteria 3 is met, it does not matter if 1 or 2 are met.  That is, the first comparison determines incidents that meet criteria 1 and criteria 2 (that is, incidents assigned to Product A and Category 1). Then the second comparison is made -- OR criteria 3 (that is, incidents assigned to Category 2). Without parentheses, incidents assigned to Product A and Category 1 meet the criteria, and all incidents assigned to Category 2 also meet the criteria. In this case, the report would list all incidents assigned to Product A and Category 1 along with all incidents assigned to Category 2 (regardless of product).  For additional information, refer to the 'Business Rule Logical Expressions' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Oracle B2C Service virus scanning capabilities and email safeguards;Answer ID 92;What safeguards does Oracle B2C Service have in place to protect the email system from abuse?;['Answer ID 2345', 'Answer ID 331'];   Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  Oracle B2C Service is making cloud computing safer. Â  Â Computer viruses present a constant threat and Oracle B2C Service takes proactive measures to protect its customers from infected files.  Virus Scanning  Oracle B2C Service Â Hosted Mailboxes: Customers have automatic virus filtering implemented for any mailbox hosted on Oracle B2C Service Â servers. The policy that Oracle B2C Service has put into place is:  Any email that comes into our system that is detected as a virus will be rejected with a ""550 Permanent Failure"" message. In this scenario the mail server that attempted to send email to our systems will be responsible for notifying the originator of the email. Â    When we send the ""550 Permanent Failure"" message back to the previous mail server, we also send a notification email to your mailbox. This email contains who the message came from, what virus was detected, and the headers from the message. These messages will come from the ""virusalert@custhelp.com"" email address. If you do not wish to create incidents you may add ""virusalert@custhelp.com"" to your discard addresses.  Use of Nonhosted Mailboxes: For customers using externally hosted mailboxes within Oracle B2C Service, we recommend that these mailboxes have virus filtering implemented. Many times a virus infected email will block other mail from coming in and require that the virus infected email be removed before your other mail can be processed. For a concise list, alphabetized by literal extension, refer to: http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types. For more information on virus updates and Internet security issues, please visit the CERT Â® Coordination Center Web site at http://www.cert.org/. Ask a Question Submittals and Â File Attachments: Customers have automatic virus filtering implemented for any file attachments sent to Oracle B2C Service's cloud from Customer Portal, API or Chat. Â  Â Oracle B2C Service tries hard to make positive and accurate attempts to eliminate infected files, but we can't guarantee we will catch everything. Â  Â For this reason, we suggest everyone also maintain their own antivirus protection and practice safe computing. Cannot open attachment: If you have clicked on the attachment and the program fails to open the file, the file may have contained a virus. Â  Â Try opening the file with a text editor. Â  Â If there is a virus related note, keep reading. How an Â infected file attachment be treated: If the incoming attachment is identified as infected, the infected file will be deleted. Â  Â Another file (with the identical original file name and extension) will be inserted containing a text phrase notifying you that the file was removed due to a detected virus. Â  Â Simply open the file with a text editor to view the text. Â  Â If you suspect the attachment file was misidentified as a virus, contact Oracle B2C Service Â Technical Support Â for assistance.   Barracuda Email Filtering  Barracuda spam filtering is available for Service mailboxes hosted with Oracle B2C Service. Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service mailboxes are not eligible for Barracuda filtering. For more information on the Barracuda spam filtering, refer to Answer ID 2345: Barracuda Spam filters on hosted Service mailboxes.  Additional Email Filtering  Oracle B2C Service's techmail utility parses email and checks for a bulk precedence setting in the header of a message and will, by default, discard any messages matching this flag. Bulk precedence is a flag set on nearly all bulk mailing servers. As an Oracle B2C Service customer, the Delete Bulk Message setting in your mailbox is enabled by default and is what controls this process. However, in rare instances, there may be originators of spam that have disabled this flag on their mail servers, therefore, such messages may come through. In addition to the Delete Bulk Message feature, there are two discard options to assist in blocking file attachment types. Two distinct fields, Discard MIME Types and Discard File Types within the Service Mailbox configurations, allow you to specify types of files that will not be attached to an incident created from mail sent to the mailbox.  Discard (Mime) Types: Enter a list of attachment type(s) you will not accept in MIME format (type/subtype). The major MIME types are application, audio, image, message, model, multipart, text, and video. Separate entries in the list with commas. An asterisk (*) can be used to match any characters. For example, to exclude MPEG video attachments, GIF images, and all audio formats, use: video/mpeg, image/gif, audio/* Â    Discard File Types: Enter a list of attachment type(s) you will not accept, based on the file name extension. Separate entries in the list with commas. Specific filenames can be specified, or an asterisk (*) can be used to match any characters. For example, to exclude all executable files, screen savers, and a script titled worm.vbs, use: *.exe, *.scr, worm.vbs, *.pif, *.doc, *.pi  For more information on configuring mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service, refer to Answer ID 331: Setting up a Mailbox in Oracle B2C Service."

Allowing agents to include file attachments with incidents, answers, and other records;Answer ID 104;Can agents attach files to incidents, chats, answers and other records?;['Answer ID 278'];   File Attachments for incidents, Chat, Ask a Question and Email;"  The ability for agents to attach files to incidents, Â answers and other records Â depends on how Â their workspace is configured. Path to the Workspace Editor: Â  Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces/Workflows For staff members, the ability to add or remove file attachments is determined by the workspace used by the staff member. The workspace defines whether the file attachments are included on a tab when working with the specific record type and whether staff have permission to add or remove files from that tab. The Read Only property associated with the file attachments control Â indicates whether files can only be opened Â and read Â or whether staff can add and remove files from that tab. When staff have permission to edit the files on the attachments tab, they can click the Add Files button on the attachments tab and browse or search for a file of interest. Â  Staff can also drag and drop files from their desktop or explorer window. Â  Staff can also select multiple files and drag and drop the files onto the Files tab. For answer records, from the Â Files tab, they can drag and drop the attachments Â so that they Â display in a specific order when viewed within the Â console. Â  On the end-use pages, they will be displayed by default in ascending order (top to Â bottom). Â  To change the order Â they are Â displayed, you will need to add them in the specific order to the answer. Â You cannot reorder incident attachments within an incident. In addition to the buttons in the toolbar on the Files tab, staff can right click on the file attachment and select from Open, Download, Properties, or Delete. The Properties option allows staff to change the display name and make the attachment private so that end-users cannot view it. Please note, you are unable to set the 'Private' property as the default. To ensure that the file can be opened properly, file attachments should not include an ampersand (&amp;) in the file name. Note - Chat file attachments: Â  Customers can attach a file so that a service agent can access it during a chat session. Â  The file attachment flow is a one-way conduit - from the customer to the agent. Â   For more information on allowing customers to attach files, refer to Answer ID 278: Allowing customers to include file attachments with their assistance requests."

Rules are not escalating incidents as soon as they should;Answer ID 128;Why aren't my rules escalating incidents as soon as they should?;['Answer ID 278'];   Business Escalation Rules Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Below are a few things to Â help troubleshoot when Â incidents are not escalating as soon as they should:  Dbstatus Utility  One consideration when evaluating escalation rules is that escalation rules are only going to escalate incidents when the dbstatus utility runs.  Â Typically, the escalation check for dbstatus runs every 15 minutes, so if you have a rule that escalates a rule more frequently than that,  Â the wait for the utility run can be up to the full interval of Â 15 minutes until the next scheduled run Â for dbstatus Â from the time the escalation time(rule_alerts.alert_time) is set. Therefore, real time escalations are simply not possible.  Â For this reason we suggest that escalation intervals be set to hour or half hour increments greater than 15 minutes with the understanding that up to 15 minutes may be added to the time the escalation level is set.  Incident Status  When an incident is in a solved state or a task is completed, they can no longer be escalated. Â  If your incident is solved or your task completed, this is another reason why it will not escalate as expected.  Work Hours  When configuring the escalation rule, you must determine whether the time element should be compared to the response requirements (work hours) configured for the application. That is, if you configure the time element in the escalation rule to be 24 hours, do you want that to be 24 hours (based on a 24-hour day) or 3 eight-hour work days? When setting up the rule, if you check the Use Response Interval check box, the hours configured in the rule represent hours as configured in your Response Requirements table. That is, if your response requirements are set up to be eight-hours each day and the rule is configured to escalate incidents in 24 hours, the incident will escalate after 3 days. If the Use Response Interval is not checked, the incident will escalate the next day.

Importing or exporting odd characters in .csv files;Answer ID 134;Can the comma separated value (CSV) import/export utility handle special characters like tildes, square brackets, quoted strings, and vertical pipes, when importing or exporting text files?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Data Import Wizard Oracle B2C Service;  CSV handles all of these different characters when it imports or exports in that format. The CSV file uses quotes to identify the beginning and end of a field. Quotes: When importing, if quotes exist in the body text, then there needs to be an additional set of quotes surrounding that text. In other words, double quotes are necessary so that the import utility does not treat the quoted text as an additional field. This acts as a comment for the quotes so that it is not treated as a new field in the CSV file. Pound Sign (#): When importing, lines beginning with a pound sign (#) are treated as comments and the import wizard will ignore them.  For additional information, refer to the 'How Data Import Works' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Forwarding an incident via email to non-staff members;Answer ID 139;Can a copy of an incident be forwarded via email to non-staff members?;['Answer ID 2056', 'Answer ID 5965'];   Message Templates, Administration Emails;"  In Oracle B2C Service, you can either manually forward a specific incident of interest to non-staff members or you can configure a workflow rule to automatically forward an incident to a specific email address that you specify. Enable Appropriate Messages Â  In order to manually forward an incident, the Admin Forward Incident Â message template Â must be enabled. To have a rule forward a copy of the incident, the E-mail Incident Information message template must be enabled. Messages and notifications can be enabled or disabled under Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Message Templates &gt; select the interface you wish to edit messages for. Next, select Administrator Emails &gt; Incident. Confirm the template type you want is enabled to Send and enabled as HTML (if desired).  Manually Forwarding Incidents Â  When working on an incident, you can use the Forward button to manually forward a copy of that incident to any email address. Â You can also right click on the incident in the report or view grid and select Forward. You can also use the CC and BCC fields to copy and blind copy recipients when forwarding an incident. You can enter any email in the Send To box, regardless of whether that email address is used with a record in the site. The email address that you enter does not need to correspond to an email already configured in Oracle B2C Service, such as a staff account or contact record. When the incident is forwarded, the incident thread and incident custom field information is sent. By default, the incident thread includes internal notes and any other thread entries. Internal Notes: By default, when using the Forward button, content entered in the incident thread as Notes are included in the email message that is sent. You can exclude internal notes from being sent with the message. In the pop-up box, simply check the Exclude Notes check box. Contact Information: When forwarding an incident, you can enable the Send Contact Information check box to include the contact information with the email. This includes the contact's name, title, type, phone numbers, and email addresses as well as any visible contact custom fields. Â  The fields that are included in the forwarded message depends on the ""merge fields"" that are defined in the ""Admin Forward Incident"" template located under ""Administrator Emails"" &gt; Â ""Incident"" for the interface the incident is being forwarded from. Please note, you are unable to set the ""Exclude Notes"" and ""Send Contact Information"" checkboxes as the default setting when forwarding an incident as this non-modifiable code. Reply-to Address: When an incident is forwarded, by default, the reply-to address in the email message is the email address of the staff member as configured in the Staff Accounts table. This allows the recipient of the forwarded incident to reply directly to the staff member who forwarded the incident. If you wish to have the reply-to address be a mailbox in your system, you can modify the Â IFWD_UI_FROM_ADDR Â configuration setting. Forward Transaction: When an incident is forwarded, you can determine who the recipient was by checking the Audit Log for that incident. Click the Details tab and then click the Audit Log radio button. Additional Comments: When you forward an incident, you can add a comment to the recipient. The comment you add is not retained within the application -- in either the incident or as part of the audit log. If you need to retain that content, first add it to the incident as an internal note so that it is retained as part of the incident. Using Rules to Automatically Forward Incidents Â  You can set up a workflow rule to email an incident to a specified email address. The address does not have to already exist in Oracle B2C Service, such as a staff account email address or contact email address. The recipient will receive an email that includes the Summary and Description of the created incident along with specific incident details, such as reference number, status, date created, and the Product and Category values. In the IF section of the rule, add criteria so that the incident(s) of interest will match the criteria. In the THEN part of the rule, you can add an action that emails the specific address. Click Â Add Action and select Email &gt; Email Incident Information. Â When the action is added to the rule, a text field displays which allows you to enter a single email address. If you need to send incident information to more than one person, you can add the Email Incident Information action again to specify a second address. Note: The ""including administration fields"" and ""including customer fields"" options for Email Incident Information do not apply to Message Templates. They only applied to the now deprecated Mail Scripts."

Text questions allow survey recipients to type an answer to the question in their own words. Text questions are open-ended questions, such as ""How can we serve you better?"" When configuring a text question, you define the Â parameters of the response area, including the maximum number of characters allowed in the response as well as the size of the response box that Â displays (that is, Â how many lines and columns Â display for the response area). Â  Choice questions provide a list of options from which the recipient can select a single value or in some cases can select multiple values. When configuring a choice questions, the options must display in one of the following formats:  Radio: Â  Each choice is listed with a radio button. Recipients can only select one option. Â    Checkbox: Each choice is listed with a checkbox. You define the maximum number of options the recipient can select when you define the question. Â    Menu: Â  The choices display in a drop-down menu. Recipients select one option from the menu. Â    List: Â  The options display in a list. Recipients can select multiple items up to the number you specify when configuring the question.  Matrix questions are used in cases where a series of questions can be responded to with the same set of answer choices. Matrix questions can help streamline a survey's appearance by grouping the questions together in a table. Answers are displayed using either radio buttons (to permit only one answer to each question) of check boxes (to allow more than one answer). If you choose radio buttons, you can restrict selections to one choice per row, forcing respondents to rank their answers.

Preventing incidents from a contact's auto-responder;Answer ID 153;A customer's auto-responder is causing an email loop, which is creating multiple incidents.;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 10338'];   All VersionsÃ‚Â / Mailbox Configuration;"  Â  Oracle B2C Service includes several features that allow you to break email loops:           Automatically Discard Auto-Response Email: You can have a mailbox automatically filter out some auto-reply email messages. The Discard Automatic Responses field for the mailbox Â can be set to Off, Conservative, Moderate or Aggressive. The default setting is Conservative, so you may need to increase this setting to reduce the chance of email loops.    In order to set the Discard Automatic Responses field to a different value, go to Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes, click the Incoming Email button in the ribbon, and use the Discard Automatic Responses drop-down menu (or Discard Filters tabs) to select the appropriate setting.   The filters used in each of the menu options (Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive) Â are defined in the EGW_AR_CONS_*_FLTR, EGW_AR_MODR_*_FLTR, and EGW_AR_AGGR_*_FLTR configuration settings. You can configure the header and body filters separately for each menu option Â by editing the corresponding configuration setting.   Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings.    Note: Â These configuration settings are automatically overwritten during an update to a site, so if you wish to use custom filters you should use the Discard Filters found at the bottom of the Incoming Email section Â of the Mailboxes configuration page. Â    Â                Prevent Mailbox from Sending Email to Itself: The EGW_LOOP_PREVENT_ENABLED configuration setting allows you to prevent an Oracle B2C Service mailbox from sending messages to itself. When EGW_LOOP_PREVENT_ENABLED is set to Yes, any email where the reply-to email address matches the reply-to email address of any mailbox in Oracle B2C Service will be discarded and no incident will be created. In this way, the mailbox deletes any messages from itself, which can prevent continuous email loops. By default, this setting is enabled (set to Yes).    Note: The ""reply-to"" and ""from"" addresses can not match the ""reply-to"" and/or ""from"" address of any other existing mailbox.   Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings.               Limit Amount of Email from an Address for a Specified Time Period: Â You can set configuration settings to allow a specified number of emails within a specific timeframe.    The EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS setting specifies the maximum number of emails that will be accepted from an individual email address within the time period specified in the EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION setting. This is used to identify and stop auto-responder email loops. For example, if this setting is set to 23 and 24 emails are received from the same address within EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION hours, the 24th email from that address will be discarded and no response email will be sent, thereby breaking the email loop. Setting the value to zero will disable this loop detection. This setting is set to 23 by default.    The EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION setting specifies the number of hours to determine if an email loop is occurring. We recommend the duration not be less than 8 hours or more than 24 hours. The default value is 12 hours.    By default, the system will only accept 23 messages from a given email address in a 12 hour period. If you use the default settings, the 24th and subsequent emails from that address will be discarded and no response email will be sent from the system.    Important! If you use forms to submit information and create incidents within your Oracle B2C Service application, incidents created from the form are all associated to the same contact record. As a result, if the form is used more than 23 times in a 12 hour period (if using the default settings), then the 24th and higher submittals will be discarded and no response sent. Therefore, if you are using forms within your answers, you should set the EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS value to be 0 to disable the loop protection. Â  Â        Note: These configuration settings are set at the per interface level. Â  Â However, they function as the maximum per mailbox associated to the interface the configurations are set.    To help illustrate the 'per mailbox' functionality:  - If a contact is sending 25 emails to the same mailbox (mailbox_id 1) within 12 hours, only 23 incidents will be created and the last 2 messages will be discarded;  - If a contact is sending 33 emails to 3 different mailboxes (10 emails to mailbox_id 1, 11 emails to mailbox_id 2 and 12 emails to mailbox_id 3) 33 incidents will be created and no email will be discarded.       See also Â Configurations EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS and EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION explained Â for more information.               Add Email Address to Discard Addresses: To break the loop, you can temporarily add the offending email address to the discard addresses list for the mailbox. Leave the address in the discarded address list through at least one run of the techmail utility, which will break the loop. Then, you can determine whether the email address is for a valid contact and determine whether that address should be removed from the discard list so that that contact can submit email in the future. If not, you can go ahead and leave that email address in the discard addresses list.             Add Business Rule to Not Create Incident: You can create a business rule to block returned messages so that the incident is not created. An example of the workflow rule is provided below:  IF Incident Source is Email and  Incident.Subject matches regular expression Out of office|auto-reply|undeliverable    THEN Do not create incident  The matches regular expression operator, the ""pipe"" ( | ) used in the above example, allows you to process incoming assistance requests based on the content submitted. In this example, any email submitted that includes the text ""out of office"", ""auto-reply"" or ""undeliverable"" in the subject line of the email will not create the incident. Depending on the nature of the incoming email, some valid emails may not create incidents based on the text included in the subject line.    Note: If you want to be notified of undeliverables, remove ""undeliverable"" from the example above."

Enabling an end-user to see incidents from other contacts and organizations;Answer ID 154;How can an end-user see incidents submitted by other contacts and organizations?;['Answer ID 1761', 'Answer ID 2179'];   Customer Portal;"  Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing. By default, on the Account &gt; Support History page, end-users can only view incidents they submit. If the contact record is associated to an organization, the default configuration does not allow the end-user the ability to view and access incidents from other contacts associated to the same organization. However, you can configure your end-user pages to allow contacts the ability to access incidents from other contacts associated to the same organization. Â  Â In order for the contact to be able to view incidents from other contacts, the contact record must be associated with an organization record. For more information on relating a contact record to an organization, refer to Answer ID 1761: Associating a Contact to an Organization Record. Also, if you are using the organization hierarchy feature, you can allow contacts to view incidents from contacts associated with sub-organizations that are lower in the hierarchy tree. Â  For more information on the organization hierarchy feature, refer to Answer ID 2179: Using the Organization Hierarchy. The specific steps to configure your end-user pages to allow contacts to access incidents for other contacts depend on which end-user pages are enabled for your site.

Â Customer Portal Page set Â version 2, Â November 2009 and later releases  In the CP pages, the OrgList2 widget displays a dropdown menu that allows Â the user to search for incidents associated to their own record or for incidents associated with other contacts in their organization Â or organization subsidiaries. The MYQ_VIEW_ORG_INCIDENTS config setting must be set to a value equal to or Â higher than the display_type attribute used with the widget. Â  When the OrgList2 widget is used, a menu field labeled Organization Type is added to the page and allows users to select which incidents are available for searching based on the associated organization and sub-organizations. Â  Note: Â  The Organization Type field only displays if the contact record is associated to an organization record. Â  That is, if Jim's record is associated to an organization and Sam's record is not, the Organization Type field only displays for Jim when he is logged in. Â  With the OrgList2 widget, the display_type attribute specifies what incidents can be viewed by the end-user that is logged in.  display_type=""1"" Â allows the end-user to view incidents for other contacts associated to the same organization. Â  The end-user cannot access incidents from sub-organizations if organization hierarchy is used. Â  With this option, the Organization Type menu displays the options Individual and Organization.   display_type=""2"" allows end-users to view incidents for other contacts in both their own organization and also for contacts associated with sub-organizations. Â  With this option, the Organization Type menu displays the options Individual, Organization, and Organization and Subsidiaries.  Adding the Organization Type field to the Advanced Search area: Â  Within the Customer Portal pages, the Â AdvancedSearchDialog widget defines the basic and advanced search functionality on the My Â Account Questions pages. Â  The account/questions/list.php files references the Â AdvancedSearchDialog Â widget In order to add the Organization Type menu to the advanced search area on the My Account pages, you must do the following:  Create a custom widget based on the AdvancedSearchDialog widget. Â  In the widgets/custom directory, add a directory for the new custom widget, i.e. named AdvancedSearchDialogCustom. Â  Copy the view.php file from the standard/search/AdvancedSearchDialog folder to the custom folder.  Note: If you need help Â creating or implementing Â this custom widget then you will need to engage Oracle Consulting. Our Oracle Consulting team is able to provide consultation and customization for a standard consulting fee.

Types of custom fields that can be added;Answer ID 155;What types of custom fields can I add to our Oracle B2C Service application?;['Answer ID 8923', 'Answer ID 1131', 'Answer ID 1102', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Custom Fields Oracle B2C Service;"  Important! Custom fields can be created as needed from the admin console without submitting an incident to Oracle B2C Service. When custom fields are added, update statements must be performed against the corresponding database table. During the time of the updates, the records in the table are inaccessible. As a result, your staff members will not be able to open or save records associated with the table that is locked. In addition, depending on the type of field being added, your end-users may have difficulty submitting assistance requests through the Ask a Question page. For example, when adding a contact custom field, the contacts table is locked to allow the custom field to be added in to all of your contact records. As a result, staff are unable to open or save incidents since the contact information is opened along with the incident record. Important! Changing a custom field column name impacts the database much the same as adding a custom field. It is also best to do this during off-peak hours. Important! Custom Fields work differently than Custom Objects. See Â Custom Objects &amp; Custom Field Deployment Basics Â for information on Custom Objects. Â    Record Types that can have Custom Fields  Custom fields can be added for Â several different Â record types:  Answers Incidents Contacts Organizations Staff accounts Opportunities Tasks Sales Products Sales Quotes  With each field added, your database becomes larger, and if you are indexing a number of these custom fields, this can significantly slow down the speed of your searches. For this reason, we recommend that indexing custom fields be kept to a minimum. Custom fields should only be indexed if you plan on searching by that field.  Â   Data Types for Custom Fields  The table below lists the types of custom fields and descriptions available. Once you have saved a custom field, you cannot edit the field to change its data type. For example, if you create a custom text field, you cannot edit that field later and change it to be a menu field. Instead, you would need to add a new custom menu field and update records to be the appropriate menu option. For descriptions of the input fields when configuring a custom field, refer to Answer ID 1131: Adding Custom Fields.          Date: Creates a date field in the format: month/day/year. Three sub-fields allow users to set each item separately.    Due to dates being stored as UNIX, the date field only includes dates back to 1970. If you need dates further back than 1970, you can add a text field. You can also configure a mask with the text field to require a specific format.   Note: Starting in August 2013 you can now create a custom object date field to hold dates that go as far back as January 1, 1902.   If you require calculations, or want to sort by date see text field used as a date field below.             Date/Time: Creates a field that includes both date and time that display in the format: month/day/year: hour/minute. Five drop-down menus are added to add each item separately. Â            Integer: Creates a field for entering numeric values only. Numerical values must be less than 2,147,483,647. If your data includes integer values larger than that, create a custom text field instead of a custom integer field. Â  Â    Â  Â   Negative integer values are allowed for this type of field. Â            Menu: Includes a drop-down menu from which end-users and staff can select an item. These fields do not allow for multiple selection using the CTRL or Shift keys as with the Product and Category fields. The name of a menu item can be between 1 and 40 characters.           Opt-in: Â  Includes a Yes/No option to include or exclude contacts from receiving emails from the Oracle B2C Service Outbound product. Â           Â  Â        Yes/No: Â  Includes two selections: Yes or No. You may specify which option is the default. Replaces the radio button functionality from previous versions.  Â            Text Area: Creates a text box for adding information. The display of this field is multi-line and this type of field can have up to 4000 characters (up to 4000 bytes, 1333 characters, if you use 3-byte/non-ascii characters). Â            Text Field: Creates a field for entering text. The display is on one line with a length between 1 and 255 characters.    You can use a text field for dates, you will need to set up the format to do so. Â  Â As an example, if you set up a text custom field to record birth dates. Using the format YYYY-MM-DD (1941-07-07), you could then sort the text string based on year, month, day because the format will text sort in a manner for the concept of year, month, day. You could set up a default value (YYYY-MM-DD) or a mask (M#M#M#M#F-M#M#F-M#M#) to represent the date format for data entry.    If you require sorting by month, independent of year, then you need to create two custom text fields, one for year, one for month and day. Â  Â As an example the year field default would be YYYY (M#M#M#M#) and the month/day field default would MM-DD (mask M#M#F1M#M#). Â  Â     Or you could have three custom fields for all three components of the date.     Â  To add a custom field:  Click the Configuration button on the Navigation Pane.   Double-click Custom fields under Database. The content pane displays the custom fields tree.   In the left-hand frame, click on the Custom field heading Â and click Â the New button on the ribbon.   Configure the field settings. Note: The Name of a field can be between 1 and 30 characters.   Click Save once all required fields are completed.  Important! Â After adding the custom field, you must edit the appropriate workspaces used by your staff and add the custom field to each workspace. Custom fields are not automatically added to workspaces.   Field Configuration  When configuring custom fields, set the following fields:        Data Type: This specifies the type of field to be configured: date, date/time, integer, menu, radio, text area, or text field. Â            Column Name: This is the name of the field as it will appear in the database. This field does not allow spaces or punctuation and cannot begin with a number. Â            Indexed: Select this box to have this field indexed in the database.    Note: Indexing should be used sparingly for custom fields. Â                   Name: Â  This is the text/prompt that is actually displayed for the administration and end-user pages of the interface. Â            Hint:  Â This is additional text provided on the end-user pages to further aid site visitors when providing information. This allows you to add a brief description of the field or an example of how to complete the field to assist your site visitors. Â  Â    Â   Note: You can add up to 4000 characters to the Hint field. If the custom field displays on the end-user pages, only the first 280 characters will display. From the administration pages, the full text entered in the Hint field displays when you mouse over the custom field. Prior to 8.2, you can add up to 40 characters to the Hint field.                  Default Value: You can add a default value, i.e. text, an integer, a specific item from the drop-down menu, or a radio button pre-selected. If the field is set as Required, the default value is overridden and the end-user or CSR must answer the question. Â    Â   Note: Default values only apply when a human has the opportunity to manually override the default value before it is committed to the database. For example, if an incident custom field specifies a default value, the field will only populate if it is editable to the end-user pages. For incoming Ask a Question submittals, the default value is only added to the custom field if the field is editable to the end-user pages. If you do not want the field to be editable on the end-user page, set up a workflow rule to set the value of the field when it is created. Â            Size of Field: This field only appears when the Data Type is Integer, Text Field, or Text Area. Use this field to set the maximum size of the field. Â            Required: Check the Required box if the field must be filled out when Â a record is created.    Note: Setting a field to be required overrides the default value specified. When the Required box is checked, a default value does not display. The customer or staff member must select an option or enter a value for a required custom field. Â  Â  Â     The Required box Â specifies the default property of the custom field when it is added to a workspace. Within the workspace, you can change the property of the field to not be required so that the field is not required for specific staff who use that workspace.   Â   Similarly, if the Required box is not checked, you can make the field required in a specific workspace so that staff must complete the field either on new records or when they are edited.           Usage: With text fields only. You can specify whether the field is a plain, URL, email address or phone number field.    Plain: the field displays with no special formatting or functionality.    URL: the field displays as a link which opens in a browser when clicked.    Email Address: the value is an email address which easily allows staff to send an email to the value in the field.    Phone Number: the value is a phone number. Â            Visibility: Specified where the custom field is displayed and where the field can be edited. For more information on the visibility settings for custom fields, refer to Answer ID 1102: Visibility Options for Custom Fields. Â  Â            Notes: You can enter comments related to the custom field. Â       For more information on custom fields refer to the documentation. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

For a list of HTML special character references, refer to http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/reference/article.php/3472621. Note: You can use this technique to add special characters in public answers. The format for special symbols and foreign characters is: &amp;#character_reference; where character_reference is the ANSI number. Note: Be sure to include the ampersand (&amp;), the number sign (#), and the semi-colon(;). For example: If you need to include a foreign character in a solution, say an Ãƒâ€˜, for example, you could enter the following in Â the Question or Answer fields: &amp;#209; Also, with regard to answers created using HTML, note that once you create the answer with the initial code and try to edit it again later, the special characters (i.e. &amp;#209;) will convert to the actual character (Ãƒâ€˜). This may cause problems when displaying the &lt; and &gt; signs around examples of HTML code in a Question or Answer field.  "

Log in to their Account and view the Support History Â page for the site   Click on the link in the email to directly update the incident in a browser window   Reply to the email (if EGW_ENABLED is set to Yes). Whether the end-user must reply between the lines provided in the email depend on the configuration of your site and the version you are using.  When the EGW_ENABLED configuration setting is enabled for the interface, in the receipt email sent to the end-user, there are directions to type between the specified lines if replying via email. Â The EGW_REPLY_BETWEEN_ENABLED configuration setting must also be enabled for the reply between the lines feature to be enabled.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  When the reply between the lines feature is enabled, if the end-user types between the two lines, then the incident is updated properly with this new text. If the customer does not type between these two lines, one of two things occur, depending on how the mailbox is configured. If the mailbox is configured to require replies to be between the two lines and an email reply is not between the beginning and ending markers, an email will be sent back to the end-user. The email will indicate that the reply must be between the markers. If the mailbox is not configured to force the end-user to reply between the lines and an email reply is not between the markers, the entire body of the email message will be added to the incident. Note: A reply detection Â extends TechmailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to detect customer replies when the Ã¢â‚¬Å“reply betweenÃ¢â‚¬Â line markers are not used. A checksum tag (such as [---001:000395:37443---]) is now appended to both text and HTML versions of the Question Receipt, Incident Response, and Incident Closed emails. When this tag appears in the quoted-back portion of a customer reply, Techmail uses it to identify and extract the portion of the reply message that is new.

Allowing end-users to subscribe to be notified when an answer is updated;Answer ID 183;How do I allow end-users to subscribe to be notified when an answer is updated?;['Answer ID 1356', 'Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 7753'];   Answers - Notifications, Customer Portal Oracle B2C Service, Oracle RightNow Cloud Service, Answer Knowledge Base;"  The Oracle B2C Service end-user pages are configured by default Â to allow site visitors the opportunity to subscribe to be notified when answers are updated. Â  This allows your users to flag which answers are of greatest interest to them so that they can be aware of changes to the answer. From the administration pages, the knowledge engineer can override the email notification from being sent out if the nature of the update is minor, such as for typographical errors or minor edits. When saving the answer, the knowledge engineer can set the Notify Subscribers menu to Do Not Notify and the answer update notification will not be sent. For more information on the Notify Subscribers field, refer to Answer ID 1356: Notify Subscriber Field. In addition, you can also configure your site to allow users to subscribe Â to receive update notifications on all answers associated with a specific product or category. Subscribers are also notified when new answers are published that are associated to the product or category. Two widgets affect the answer notification functionality in your end-user pages:  The AnswerNotificationIcon widget Â enables the Â ability for end-users to subscribe to an answer. This widget Â is included by default in the answers/detail.php file:  Â   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &lt;rn:widget path=""standard/notifications/AnswerNotificationIconIcon"" /&gt;  Â  When included in a file, the Notify Me Â option displays for logged in users.   The Prod/CatNotificationManager widget allows users the ability to subscribe to all answers assigned to a selected product or category. This widget Â is included by default in the account/notif/list.php file:  Â   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &lt;rn:widget path=""standard/notifications/ProdCatNotificationManager""/&gt;    There are Â also configuration settings that must be enabled as well. The first two Â enable notifications Â for answers and for products and categories. Â  Â If they are not enabled, no email will be sent when an answer is updated or when an answer associated to a particular product or category that a contact has Â subscribed to is updated.  ANS_NOTIF_PROD_CAT_ENABLED ANS_NOTIF_ENABLED Next, this first one is when you want the subscription to notifications to expire. Â  Â The last is the unsubscribe url. ANS_NOTIF_DURATION CP_ANS_NOTIF_UNSUB_URL To edit the above settings: Â Select Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; search by Key. For more information, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing configuration settings.   Additional Considerations  Below are additional considerations relating to the confirmation of Answer Update Notifications. Length of subscriptions: Â  By default, answer subscriptions do not expire.  Â You can set an amount of time for answer subscriptions to expire by editing the ANS_NOTIF_DURATION Â configuration setting. Â  Â A value of zero (0) means notifications will not expire. Â  Â Any other value will set an expiration date. A user can renew Â existing requests, which resets the duration to start from the date of the renewal request, by either clicking the 'Notify Me' Â option when viewing the answer or through the functionality under the Account Overview &gt; Manage Notifications section in the end-user interface. An end-user can also delete their answer subscriptions, per answer, from Â Account Overview &gt; Manage Notifications on the end-user interface. Likewise, when they do receive a notification, there is a link in the email to then Unsubscribe if they wish. Â  If the ANS_NOTIF_DURATION setting is set to something other than 0, the Answer Update Notification Expired email message, if enabled, is sent to the end-user when their notification expires. Â   Enabling the notification emails: Â  In order for end-users to receive the notification email, the Answer Update Notification message must Â be enabled in the site. To notify people that their subscription has expired, the Answer Update Notification Expired message must be enabled. Â  To check this, go to Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Message Templates &gt; Choose the interface you want to enable messages for &gt; select Contact Emails and expand the Answers section.  Troubleshooting answer notifications: Â  In the event you receive a report that notifications are not sending and/or contacts are not receiving answer notification emails, refer to Â Answer ID 7753: Troubleshooting Answer Update Notifications not sending for tips on confirming proper configuration of this feature."

If the incident has been solved for a longer period of time, the end-user cannot reopen the incident and instead Â must submit a new incident. When viewing an incident from the Account - Â Support History page, an Update button displays on the page if the end-user can add a thread to the incident. If the reopen deadline has passed, the Update button is removed from the page. If the customer responds via email to a solved incident that has been solved longer than the time specified, a new incident is created and the text ""Incident created due to reply to expired incident yymmdd-xxxxxx"" is automatically entered by the system to indicate why it generated a new incident instead of updating the existing record.   The specific approach for configuring how long solved incidents can be updated depend on which end-user pages your site is using. Â  In the CP files to allow users to reopen incidents at any time, regardless of the incident's age, you need to remove the following lines of code from the details.php file located at account/questions/detail.php: &lt;rn:condition incident_reopen_deadline_hours=""168""&gt; Â  Â (the numeric value here may be different for you) And  Â  Â &lt;rn:condition_else/&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;h2 class=""rn_HeadingBar""&gt;#rn:msg:INC_REOPENED_UPD_FURTHER_ASST_PLS_MSG#&lt;/h2&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;/rn:condition&gt; It is necessary to remove all of these lines to avoid errors on your page. Â  Â Once you've made this change, you will need to publish your customer portal page set for it to be live. Note: Â  Â The MYQ_REOPEN_DEADLINE configuration setting is no longer valid when using the customer portal end user pages. Â  Â However, this setting Â is still used by WAP and Techmail. MYQ_REOPEN_DEADLINE configuration setting still applies to Techmail updates no matter what version you are on - if you are on CP you need to change this setting and your end user pages. This configuration setting specifies the number of hours after which an incident cannot be reopened by the end-user. A value of '-1' disables this setting. A value of '0' prevents closed incidents from being reopened. Default is 168 (or 7 days).  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.

Changing the color of escalated incidents;Answer ID 203;How do I change the color of escalated incidents?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Using Data Exceptions in Resports Analytics, Incidents;" Reports are used to display records within the Â Oracle B2C Service Â Console. Within a report, you can use data exceptions to customize the display of records that meet specific criteria. By default, the Incidents standard search Â report includes an exception that flags all escalated incidents that are not solved Â in red text. To change the color of escalated incidents in this report, you must copy the report so that you can edit the exception. If you have multiple reports that flag escalated incidents, you must edit each report separately. The default Â data expression used for escalated incidents Â in the Incidents report is: Expression: IF(NVL(incidents.escllevel, 0) &gt; 0 &amp; incidents.status_type &lt;&gt; 2, 1, 0) Operator: equals Value: 1 This expression has two components: NVL(incidents.escllevel, 0) &gt; 0 Â compares the escalation level to be greater than 0 (if the escalation level is null, use 0) incidents.status_type &lt;&gt; 2 indicates that the incident status type is not solved. (The database value for a solved status type = 2) So the IF statement in the expression corresponds to: IF Â the escalation level is greater than 0 (where null escalations are set to 0) AND the incident status type is not equal to Solved, THEN set the expression to a value of 1. Â  Otherwise, set the expression to a value of 0. Next, compare the expression value to the operator and value. Â  If the expression has a value of 1, it meets the data exception and the record will display using the Tabular display that you define for the exception. If the expression has a value of 0, then, it does not match the data exception. To change the color of escalated incidents in a report: Use the steps below. You can use the data exception from the Incidents report as a starting point if you wish. If the report is a standard report, copy the report and open the copy for editing. Otherwise, open the existing report for editing. Â   Â  Open the data exception for editing. In standard reports, the exception is typically named ""escalated"". In the pop-up window, review the name and display reference.  Â  On the Definition tab, set the Expression, Operator, and Value fields to indicate the criteria for the exception.  Â  Click the Tabular Display tab. Â   Â  In the Tabular Exception Notification section, you can modify the color, data symbol and font style that will be used to display records that match the criteria on the Definition tab. Â   Â  If your report includes a graph, click the Graphical Display tab to customize the graphical display associated with exceptions. Â   Â  Click OK to close the exception window. Â   Â  Add or edit other exceptions as needed. Â   Â  When finished, save your report. If you copied the report and staff do not have the ability to manage their navigation sets, you can edit their navigation set to include the new report. If staff can manage their navigation sets, notify your staff to update their navigation list to include the new report."

Specifying answer access levels to display on the end-user pages;Answer ID 208;How do I define which access levels are displayed on the end-user pages?;['Answer ID 1112', 'Answer ID 1838', 'Answer ID 412'];   Privileged Access, Access Levels;"  Answer access levels can be configured to display on the end-user pages for each specific interface. Within each interface, at least one access level MUST be enabled for end-user visibility in order for the application to work properly. To enable a custom access level to be displayed on the end-user pages, use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select Application Appearance &gt; Â Customizable Menus &gt; Answer Access Levels. To edit an answer access level, click it in the tree. To add a new answer access level, click the New button in the ribbon In the Â Interface Visibility section, enable the check box for each interface where you would like this access level to display. Â  If you do not want the answer access level to be visible on the interface, clear the Visible check box. Click the Save and Close button to save the answer access level and close the editor.  In order for answers to appear on the customer portal, the Status, Language, Access Level, Product and Category fields must be set to a visibility that allows access by customers. If even one field does not allow visibility, the answer is not visible on the customer portal. Â  In addition, if you have sections within an answer with restricted visibility, that section must be assigned an access level associated with the answer and have end-user visibility selected. For more information on these criteria, refer to Answer ID 1112: Publishing an answer to the end-user pages. Note: If the access level is to be used for privileged access, the end-user visibility box should NOT be checked.

Including or excluding specific products (or categories) from an interface;Answer ID 212;How do I exclude specific products and categories from an interface?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 1112', 'Answer ID 1838', 'Answer ID 412'];  Products/Categories;" Note: If you have only one product or sub-product visible for an interface, then there are no selection options, so the Product menu is not displayed on the end-user pages even if the Search page view is configured to display the menu. In order for the menu to display, there must be at least two products or sub-products visible to the end-user pages. This works similarly for the Categories menu as well. With products and categories, you can edit the visibility settings to specify which interfaces will include that value on the administration pages and on the end-user pages. You can exclude a product or category from an interface using the steps below: From the Configuration items, select Â Service &gt; Products/Categories/Dispositions.  Â  Right-click on the name and select Edit.  Â  In the Visibility section of the page, disable the check boxes next to the interface name. To remove the product or category only from the end-user pages of the interface, leave the Administration check box checked and remove the check from the End User box.  Â  Click Save."

Restricting computers or hosts that can access the Oracle B2C Service console and end-user pages;Answer ID 245;How do I restrict which computers (hosts)Ã‚Â are allowed to access theÃ‚Â agent console and end-user pages?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 10427'];   Configuration Settings Oracle B2C Service (OSvC), All versions including Browser User Interface (BUI);"  The SEC_VALID_ADMIN_HOSTS  Â setting defines which hosts are allowed to access the agent console. Only users logging in from hosts matching entries in this list are allowed access to the agent console. Â  Important! Â  Use caution when editing this setting. An incorrect setting (i.e. an incorrect IP address) may lock you out of your site. If this happens, submit a service request to Ask Technical Support. Â  In addition, the SEC_VALID_ENDUSER_HOSTS configuration setting works similarly but with respect to accessing the end-user pages. Only users logging in from hosts matching entries listed in this setting are allowed access to the end-user pages. You Â can edit the SEC_INVALID_ENDUSER_HOSTS configuration setting to explicitly Â list which hosts are not allowed to access the end-user interface.  Â   Path to edit settings is: Select Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings.     Valid entries to these settings include (in a comma separated list) Â domain names with wildcards (*.mycompany.com), or single Â IPv4 and or IPv6  Â addresses (216.136.229.72), (FE80:0000:0000:0000:0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329 or FE80::::0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329) Â and or IPv4 or IPv6 address ranges defined using standard CIDR (Classless Interdomain Routing) Notation. For IPv4, use subnet masks such as (216.136.229.0/255.255.255.0) to specify ranges.  Â  For IPv6 Â ranges are specified as follows: 2620:0:860:2::/64 Instead of, or in addition to, an IP address range, a domain may be entered. This Â should be included at the end of the list of IP addresses.  Example: 216.136.229.72, 216.136.229.0/255.255.255.0, *.domain.com Note: When using a domain name, a network operation must execute a DNS reverse lookup. This will result in connection delays and may induce a noticeable performance degradation of the Service Cloud Application. Â Whenever possible, please refrain from using a domain name.  Additional Notes:  You cannot use wildcards (*) to specify a range of IP addresses, i.e. 1.2.3.* or 1.2.3*.   When specifying IP address ranges use only standard CIDR notation.   It is possible to specify a comma separated list of the above values, such as:   Example: 216.136.229.72, 216.136.229.0/255.255.255.0      The use of hard returns is not permitted in these configuration settings. Any entries after a hard-return are not recognized. Good example: 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5, 1.2.3.6  Bad example: 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5, 1.2.3.6   To determine your IP, visit https://cx.rightnow.com/app/utils/whatsmyip. Private IP addresses such as 192.168.0.0, 10.0.0.0, or 172.16.0.0 may not be used in this setting.   Additional Considerations  Modifying the SEC_VALID_ADMIN_HOSTS setting limits your exposure from somebody hacking into the administrative side of the product from another network. It also limits your ability to administrate your application from outside your corporate network. However, there are options available that would allow access into the admin side of the Â Oracle B2C Service Â application. These options and their pros and cons are outlined below:        Option: List the IP subnets of the AdminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ISP in the Valid Admin Host settings.    Pros: This allows access from the AdminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home dial-up or high-speed provider.    Cons: The ISP may have multiple IP subnets, or they may change IP numbers without your knowledge. Every subnet listed gives hackers greater chance of access. Â    Â  Â            Option: Dial-in access to your corporate network.    Pros: As long as the corporate dial-in is allowed Internet access with the correct IP subnet, This approach should work.    Cons: Not all corporations allow dial-in access. Â    Â   Â            Option: Use a product such as PC Anywhere or Windows Terminal Server to remotely control your corporate desktop PC from home.    Pros: This approach may be a bit slow, but this should work.    Cons: This is subject to the corporate IS policy on the remote control of PCs. Most corporations do not allow this. Â    Â            Option: Set up VPN access to the corporate network which allows Internet access out of the corporate firewall.    Pros: This is probably the most secure method of access.    Cons: Requires the VPN software and equipment necessary, and support from the corporate IS group.   Â  Â            Option: Set up a proxy server inside the corporate firewall to forward HTTP protocol out to the Internet.    Pros: A forward proxy acts a gateway for a client's browser, sending HTTP requests on the client's behalf to the Internet. When the Â Oracle Â HTTP server receives the request, it sees the requestor's address as originating from the proxy server on the corporate network, not from the actual client.    Cons: This approach needs to be combined with VPN access to provide best security. The corporate IS group would need to configure the proxy server.

Setting how long incidents remain as waiting before being closed;Answer ID 263;How do I change how long an incident remains in the waiting status before being closed by Oracle B2C Service?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 2021', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Incident Statuses, Agedatabase Oracle B2C Service;"  The CI_HOURS configuration setting specifies how many hours an incident is set to a Waiting status type, and Â remains in that status before the agedatabase utility closes it. Set this value to 0 to prevent agedatabase from closing incidents. The number of hours is not based on the work hours setting; the number of hours is based on a standard 24-hour day. By default, this setting is set to 48 hours (2 days). However, the CI_WAITING_CALC_DAYS configuration setting also affects when an incident set to a Waiting status type can be set to Solved. The CI_WAITING_CALC_DAYS configuration setting defines the days that agedatabase will include when calculating how long an incident has been in the Waiting state. The format is ""SuMTuWThFSa"". If left blank, agedatabase will include all days. If you wish to include only Mondays through Fridays as days that count towards the waiting period, you can set this setting to be MTuWThF.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. After editing the Value field, click Update. If necessary, click another setting, edit the Value field and click Update. When finished editing, click Commit and Exit to register your changes.  For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings. When an incident has been in Waiting for longer than the amount of time specified in CI_HOURS, agedatabase will close the incident -- as long as it is within the value of the CI_WAITING_CALC_DAYS setting. Since agedatabase only runs once a day (usually in the middle of the night), incidents set to Waiting can only be closed once per 24-hour period. For this reason, you may notice that incidents are actually closed AFTER the number of hours specified in the CI_HOURS configuration setting. In addition, agedatabase does not send the closed notification email if the last update time is more than 4 times the value of the CI_HOURS setting. Â  This is to prevent sending an email for incidents that are significantly old. Â  As a result, the CI_HOURS setting should not be set to a value that is less than 1/4 the frequency that agedatabase runs. For example, Â if agedatabase runs once per day, it is best to set the CI_HOURS setting to a value greater than or equal to 6 hours. For more information, refer to Answer ID 2021: When does an incident close if I update a Waiting incident?

Enabling Email Gateway to allow incidents via email;Answer ID 268;What is Email Gateway and how do I enable it?;['Answer ID 331', 'Answer ID 1272', 'Answer ID 5380', 'Answer ID 2205', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Email management Oracle B2C Service;"  Effectively managing incoming email is a major factor in providing quality customer service. Oracle B2C Service's email response management function, Email Gateway, provides you with the ability to convert incoming email into incidents within Oracle B2C Service. This eliminates the need for your agents to check multiple sources and locations for assistance requests from your customers. Within Oracle B2C Service, the techmail utility runs at given intervals to access your email Â accounts specified in the Mailboxes table and pulls the email messages into Oracle B2C Service as new incidents. Agents can then respond to these incidents from the administration side of the application. Customers can also update their incidents via email. Â Additionally, you can create Â incident rules to further reduce support interaction and response time to your customers. The EGW_ENABLED  Â configuration setting specifies whether Email Gateway is enabled to allow incoming emails to be sent to a mailbox and processed as incidents.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  Additional Steps  Mailboxes table: In addition to enabling the configuration setting, you must also set up at least one mailbox in the Mailbox table. For more information on setting up mailboxes, refer to Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service. If your site uses a firewall: Email Gateway must be able to access your mailbox through port 110 of your firewall. If you cannot open this port or your firewall, you can redirect email into a mailbox hosted at Oracle B2C Service. When Email Gateway is enabled and a mailbox is correctly configured, any existing email messages in your mailbox inbox will be pulled into Oracle B2C Service and handled according to workflow rules you configure. If your existing mailbox account has an alias name, you must enter the real account information into the mailboxes table. Forwarding vs. Redirecting Emails: Â Do NOT forward messages from an email client into a mailbox for Oracle B2C Service. Forwarding messages replaces the contact information in the FROM area, and you will lose valuable tracking information if the original email address is not present. Â  Instead, your IT group can redirect messages to an Oracle B2C Service hosted mailbox. For more information on redirecting email, refer to Answer ID 1272: Using a Company Domain as the Sent Email Address. Additional Features to Evaluate: Once you have enabled the EGW_ENABLED setting and configured at least one mailbox for each interface, you can then evaluate several related features, including:        Determine which email messages in the Messages table should be enabled and in what format. For more information, refer to Answer 5380: Customizing notifications and email messages sent by Oracle B2C Service. Â            Create rules for routing incidents submitted via email.

Enabling file attachments for email requests is configured separately from enabling file attachments for requests via the Ask a Question page. This information affects incoming assistance requests from your site visitors and contacts. Staff members can always attach and send files depending on how their workspace is configured. Â  Â Refer to Â Answer ID 104: Allowing agents to include file attachments with incidents, answers, and other records for more information. With email filtering you can specify what types of attachments will be discarded, but not what types are allowed.  Ask a Question Requests:  This functionality is enabled by default for the Ask a Question page (standard FileAttachmentUpload widget).   Email Requests:  To allow file attachments with incoming email requests, each mailbox is configured separately to allow incoming file attachments. To do this, use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes &gt; Service Mailboxes. Double-click Â on the mailbox name. Click the Incoming Email button on the ribbon. Click the ""Enable Attachments"" Â box next to Max Attachment Â Size Â field.

Maximum size of file attachments;Answer ID 280;What is the maximum size of file attachments I can attach to a record?;['Answer ID 331'];   File Attachments, Mailboxes Oracle B2C Service;"  File Attachments for Ask a Question Submittals and Administrative Records A number of factors affect what size file attachments can be attached within your Oracle B2C Service Â application. This applies to files attached to your records from the administration pages, such as a staff member attaching a file to an incident, answer, or sales opportunity. Â  This also applies to files attached to incidents that are submitted from the Ask a Question page and Chat. The FATTACH_MAX_SIZE Â configuration Â setting specifies the maximum size in bytes of files which can be uploaded to the Oracle B2C Service Server. Maximum is 125829120 (120 MB). Default is 20971520 (20 MB). However, several other variables also affect the maximum size. Â  The FATTACH_MAX_SIZE is also used to restrict the size of a report being forwarded.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  All web servers supported by Oracle Â contain a time-out setting that terminates connections after a set period. All sites have this set Â to 5 minutes as a security precaution. In general, this time period has the biggest effect on the maximum allowed file attachment size. This is also applicable when attaching files Â for a service request in the Oracle B2C Service Support site. With average bandwidth, most users can attach files of about 5.5 to 8 MB in 5 minutes. So, for all practical purposes, this is the limit. Keep in mind, circumstances exist when you would not be able to attach a 6 MB file to an incident -- primarily due to your connection speed to your Web server (or our hosting facilities if applicable). If a user is running via a modem or other slower connection, they might only be able to attach small files to an incident. Users with exceptionally high bandwidth, however, might be able to attach files larger than 8 MB. The maximum size file attachment you can submit through the end-user pages is constrained primarily by a 5 minute limit on submission time. In addition, some networks and firewalls have limits on the file sizes that can be passed through a connection. In some cases this setting is the limiting factor in attachment size. Sites which were originally created on versions older than August 2015 may require an adjustment to the PHP.INI file to reflect some large file attachment size settings. If you make changes to your attachment size, your site was created prior to August 2015, and your changes do not appear to be working Â please create a service request with support asking for an an adjustment to the PHP.INI file Â on our servers.   File Attachments for Email Submittals  File attachments arriving in your Oracle B2C Service site via email are affected by the setting specified in your mailbox setup. Settings in your mailbox configuration have no effect on file attachments uploaded from the end-user pages or attached from the administration pages. For information regarding mailbox setup, refer to Setting Up a Mailbox. If your mailbox is hosted by Oracle, there is a recommended 25 MB size limit for emailed attachments both to and from the hosted account. When sending or receiving multiple attachments, the combined size of the attachments should not exceed the 25 MB limit. Â  The default size limit set per mailbox is 5 MB, so if you want to receive larger files, you will need to adjust your mailbox settings accordingly. Email accounts not hosted by Oracle may not have this same size limitation. Check with your mail administrator or provider for details in this case.   Accessing Files that Exceed the Maximum  For larger files that you want to attach to an answer or incident, consider storing your file on your web server. These files would be stored in a location along with Â the other pages for your corporate web site. You can then use the URL for that file as either a link in an answer or provide the URL in a response to an incident to allow access to the file or document. This allows you to avoid the attachment size consideration. To use this method, work with your IT group or your webmaster to determine where the file should be stored and how to access it."

Require end-users to reply to between the lines for incident updates;Answer ID 282;How do I require end-users to reply between the lines when responding to incidents by email?;['Answer ID 331'];  Outgoing Email Oracle B2C Service;" When the reply between the lines features is enabled for email messages sent by your Oracle B2C Service application, you can force end-users to reply between the provided lines in order to update their incident from email. When the end-user replies to the email, only content provided between the lines is included in the incident thread (as opposed to the entire email contents) and the update is only processed if content is provided between the lines. To configure your site to require end-user to use the reply between the lines feature, you must verify that your configuration settings are set properly as well as the Service mailbox.  Step 1: Set Configuration Settings  The EGW_REPLY_BETWEEN_ENABLED configuration setting specifies whether the Reply Between the Lines feature is enabled in outgoing Service email messages. This setting must be set to Yes in order for the lines below to be included in your email responses: [===&gt; Please enter your reply below this line &lt;===] [===&gt; Please enter your reply above this line &lt;===]  Â   In addition, please be aware that the Email Gateway must be enabled in order for 'reply between the lines' text to be included in your outgoing email responses. The EGW_ENABLED configuration setting determines whether the email gateway is enabled or not. Â  Â EGW_ENABLED must be set to Yes in order to allow incoming email via a Service mailbox to be processed. Â  Â Please do not disable EGW_ENABLED unless you want to cease all incoming email for the associated interface. Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.   Step 2: Force Reply Between Lines in Mailbox Configuration  In addition, the Force Reply Between Lines field in the Mailboxes table specifies that if an email reply is not between the beginning and ending markers, an email will be sent back to the customer. The email indicates that the reply must be between the markers. If the Force Reply Between Lines option is not enabled in the mailbox, if an email reply is not between the markers, the entire body of the message will be added to the incident. To edit the Force Reply Between Lines feature, use the steps below: From the Service Administration items, select Communication Configuration &gt; Service Mailboxes.  Â  In the left-hand frame, expand the list of mailboxes and right-click on the mailbox name and select Edit.  Â  In the right-hand frame, click the Incoming E-mail tab.

Escalation rules not executing after a certain time;Answer ID 300;The escalation rules that we have set up normally execute properly, but do not escalate incidents after 6:00 p.m. each evening.;['Answer ID 5168'];"  Business Rules &gt; Escalation Rules"; When you add the Escalate action to a rule, you have the option of enabling the Use Response Interval checkbox. When this is enabled, the rule is configured so that it only counts time based on the response intervals configured in the Default Response Requirements table. That is, if your response intervals are from 8:00 (a.m.) to 18:00 (6:00 p.m.) and your escalation rule has the Use Response Interval box checked, escalations will only occur during the response interval hours you have configured. If the User Response Interval box is unchecked, escalations can happen at any time, including non-working hours. Review your escalation rules to determine if the Use Response Interval box is checked. If you need to edit the rule, be sure to click Activate after your edits so that your changes are included in the rulebase.

Printing and reporting all our public answer content;Answer ID 307;How can I print all the public answers for our site?;['Answer ID 2509'];   Answers;"  From within Oracle B2C Service, there is no means to print all of your answers with all of their content formatted for display. You can, however, create a custom report that includes Â the following answer fields as columns in the report: Â Answer ID (answers.a_id), Summary (answers.summary), Question (answers.description), and the Â Answer text (answers.solution). When defining the report output columns, you can add additional fields as you deem necessary. For more information on creating custom reports, refer to the appropriate answer according to your version of software:  Answer ID 2509: Creating a Basic Custom Report  When creating a report that includes the content of the question and answer fields, we recommend that you limit the number of answers included in the report to be between 300 and 500 answers due to the size of the report that is generated. You can include a run-time filter based on the Answer ID field using the ""between"" operator so that you can specify a range of answer IDs when you generate the report. For larger knowledge bases, you may need to run the report a few times so that you can capture the information from all answers in your site. HTML Code Displays: Â  You can remove the HTML code from your question and answer fields by editing the column format. When configuring the report, right click on the Question (description) or Answer (solution) field and select Edit Column Format. In the pop-up window, enable the Strip HTML tags check box and click OK. With this option, you will see the basic, unformatted content of the field in your report. The content is not rendered (formatted) since the HTML code has been removed from the report."

Using headers to troubleshoot email issues in the Oracle B2C Service application;Answer ID 313;How can I view a header to determine an email's path orÂ origin?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 4781'];   E-mail Inbound, Outbound, Outreach, Marketing;"  To determine the origin of an email and how Â it may be entering or leaving your Oracle B2C Service site, it is useful to view the email header. Â  Headers are contained in the console in an attached Â the .msg file, email header, or in your email client such as Gmail. Â  Â Email headers determine where a message is sent, and records the specific path the message follows as it passes through each mail server. To follow the path of a message chronologically, read from the bottom of the header, and work your way up. In order to have email headers included within emails on your site, you will need to make sure that the configuration setting EGW_SAVE_EMAIL_HEADERS or EGW_SAVE_ORIG_MESSAGE is set to ""yes."" Â  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings. To view a header within your site, if the source of an incident is email, you will see an envelope icon beside the Contact's name in the blue title bar of the discussion thread. Once EGW_SAVE_EMAIL_HEADERS is enabled, it is also possible to create a custom report to view header information. Note, the header information is stored in the threads table which is commonly joined to the incidents table in reports. Due to the size of these tables, it is recommended to limit the amount of data being pulled by reference number or date range. Â  To view the header information within a report, include the Mail Header (mail_hdr) field from the threads Â table as an output column. Â  With the 'save header' setting enabled, for incidents created from email, the email header information will be returned. Â  For more information on creating a custom report, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a basic custom report. You can also view headers for outgoing email in most mail clients. Â  Refer to Answer ID 4781: Collecting email headers or source for Oracle B2C Service Technical Support for more information. A sample email header is provided below. For example purposes, the server and email information have been generalized such as ""account@domain.com"". The header has also been truncated to make it easier to read. Â  Â  Â In the example below, the Received lines are the most useful. From the top, they represent the receipt on the e-mail servers that handled this e-mail from most recent to least recent. The top Received line is usually the machine that actually performed final delivery of email. One indication that the headers may have been falsified (commonly known as spoofed message) is if the ""by hostname.domain"" portion does not match the ""from hostname.domain"" portion within the Received line. ============================================ Return-Path: &lt;account@domain.com&gt; Received: from mailserver1.mysite.com (mailserver1.mysite.com [server's IP Address]) by mailserver1l.mysite.com ...

Description of SmartAssistant;Answer ID 322;What is SmartAssistant and how does it help our customer base?;['Answer ID 4699'];   SmartAssistant Suggested Solutions Oracle B2C Service;"  SmartAssistant is a term for the intelligent feature set that helps both end-users and staff members to find answers that have been published to the end-user pages. Related Answers:  There are two main technologies that underlie SmartAssistant. The first is a ""Swarm Intelligence-styled"" approach to data mining -- otherwise known as Related Answers. Related Answers are the links that sometimes show up at the bottom of an answer that you are reading on the end-user interface. This feature of SmartAssistant continually monitors end-user sessions, gathering information about which answers your customers are finding most helpful, and tracking the path by which those customers are reaching those answers. When you click a link to view a Related Answer, in effect you are given access to information that other users frequently viewed as well; thus, learning from the experiences of other customers who have had issues similar to yours.  Suggested Solutions:  A second technology utilized is Natural Language Processing, which is performed during searching and when submitting an Ask a Question request. The results of the Natural Language Processing are then compared against the published knowledge base to find the best matches. This technology is used for SmartAssistant suggested solutions, both when configuring workflow rules to suggest answers in a preliminary response, or when staff members click the Suggestions... button when editing an incident. Essentially, the subject and thread of an incident are language-parsed and fed through the searching algorithm of Oracle B2C Service. This content is compared to clusters of answers to determine which cluster the incident content best matches. A set of the closest matching answers from the answer cluster are returned from your published answers.  Reduce Solved Count of Unused Answers:  In addition, the agedatabase utility provides the ability to manage the size of the database by pruning old SmartAssistant information from the clicktrack (session tracking) and links tables. Agedatabase also implements a decay function on the score of both answers and links so that unaccessed information receives a lower ranking over time. As a result, answers that have not been accessed in a long time have their score reduced and are less likely to be listed as a related answer.  For more information, refer to the following resources: Popular Answers About SmartAssistant Using SmartAssistant on Submit a Question pages Adding Content to Responses"

Using spell check;Answer ID 324;Is spell checking functionality available in Oracle B2C Service?;['Answer ID 2483', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Spell Check, All versions Oracle B2C Service;"  The spell check functionality Â can be Â enabled and configured within the workspaces used by staff members. This allows administrators to require spell checking for certain staff profiles and enabling or disabling spell check for certain fields within the workspace. Spell checking is enabled on a field-by-field basis by Â enabling the Spell Check workspace property for that field. Â  Spell checking can be enabled for any text or text area field within the workspace, including custom fields and fields used with contact and organization records. Â      Click to enlarge image    Spell check on record save: Â  You can configure the workspace so that the spell check is invoked when the record is saved. The fields that are enabled for spell checking are evaluated automatically when the staff member clicks Save or Save and Close. The spell-check-on-save feature can be enabled separately for each workspace. This allows you to configure specific workspaces to perform the spell check automatically, but allow other workspaces to not use the automatic spell check. To enable automatic spell checking for a workspace, use the steps below:  Open the workspace for editing.   Set the Spell Check property to be enabled for the fields in your workspace that you wish to have spell checked.   Click the Home tab &gt; Workspace Properties &gt; Spell Check &gt; and enable the Auto-check Spelling on Save option. Also evaluate whether to enable the Allow Canceling Auto-check box.   Save the workspace.  Inline spell checking: Â  Within the Incident Thread relationship item (by default used on the Messages tab in incident workspaces), you can enable inline spell checking so that misspelled words are Â underlined in red Â as the agent types their response. Â  This allows the agent to easily see and correct errors within their incidents. Inline spell checking is also available with the Â Opportunity Notes relationship item in opportunity workspaces.  Spell Check property options: Â  Â The Spell Check property uses the options below to enable and disable spell checking on that field:  True: Â  When set to True, the field is included for spell checking when the staff member clicks the Spell Check button in the toolbar. Â  If multiple fields are enabled for spell checking, the fields are evaluated based on the ordering of the TabIndex property. Â    False: Â  When set to False, the field is not included for spell checking. Â    As You Type: Â  Â This option is available with the Incident Thread and Opportunity Notes relationship items. Within the field, spelling is Â evaluated as the staff member Â enters content. Â  Misspelled words are underlined in red to alert the staff member.  To modify spell checking within a workspace, use the steps below:  Open the workspace for editing. Â  Â  Click the field within the workspace designer. Â  Â  From the Design tab &gt; Options section &gt; Spell Check &gt; Â set the Spell Check property. Â  Â  Click another field and set the Spell Check property for each field of interest.

Operators used when configuring rules;Answer ID 325;What are the values of the Operator field when configuring rules?;['Answer ID 486'];   Operators in Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;"  The operators listed below can be used to specify IF conditions when creating business rules in Oracle B2C Service. The specific options listed depend on the field you select in the IF condition of the rule. Note: If you use a regular expression in the Value field of the IF criteria, you must use either the MATCHES REGULAR EXPRESSION or DOES NOT MATCH REGULAR EXPRESSION operator. For more information on regular expressions, refer to Answer ID 486: Using Regular Expressions.        EQUALS -- This criteria is met if the field matches the value exactly, including case. This operator is useful with fields that use a drop-down menu.    When using this field to configure specific text content, you must include single quotes around the text of interest. For example, you can set criteria to be Organization.Name EQUALS 'ABC Company'.         NOT EQUALS -- This criteria is met if the field does not match the value exactly, including case.           LESS THAN -- The criteria is met if the field is less than the value specified. This is available only when an field with numeric values is selected such as an integer or date field. Also available is the Less than or Equal to option.           GREATER THAN -- The criteria is met if the field is less than the value specified. This is available only when an field with numeric values is selected such as an integer or date field. Also available is the Greater than or Equal to option.           IN RANGE -- This criteria is met if the value of the field is within the numerical or date range you specify. A value that equals an end point of the range is within the range and matches the expression.           NOT IN RANGE -- This criteria is met if the value of the field is outside the numerical or date range you specify.           CONTAINS -- The criteria is met if any part of the field matches the stemmed value or the word or words specified. This operator can be useful with text fields, i.e. the Summary or Thread fields.    If you include multiple words, the stemmed versions of the words must be included somewhere in the content of the field specified. That is, if you set the Value to be ""dog cat"", in order for a record to match, the field must include a form of ""dog"" (including dogs) and also a form of ""cat"". This operator is not case-sensitive.    Note: When using this operator, do not use wildcards in the Value field.           DOES NOT CONTAIN -- The criteria is met if the value specified does NOT appear anywhere in the field. In addition, the field cannot contain any word that shares the same stem of the word listed. This operator can be useful with text fields, i.e. the Summary or Thread fields. This operator is not case sensitive    Note: When using this operator do not use wildcards in the Value field.           MATCHES REGULAR EXPRESSION -- The criteria is met if the field matches the regular expression specified in the Value field of the condition. This operator is not case sensitive.           DOES NOT MATCH REGULAR EXPRESSION -- The criteria is met if the field does not match the regular expression specified in the Value field of the condition. This operator is not case sensitive.           IN RESPONSE INTERVAL -- This criteria is used only with the Incident.Created field and is met if the incident was created within normal working hours; that is, the incident was created within the response requirements of the SLA associated with the incident or within the default response requirements if no SLA is associated with the incident.           NOT IN RESPONSE INTERVAL -- This criteria is used only with the Incident.Created field and is met if the incident was not created within normal working hours; that is, the incident was not created within the response requirements of the SLA associated with the incident or not within the default response requirements if no SLA is associated with the incident.           MODIFIED THIS EDIT -- This criteria is met if the value of the field changed from when the record was opened to when it was saved.             NOT MODIFIED THIS EDIT -- This criteria is met if the value in the field remains unchanged from when the record is opened to when it is saved.         IS NULL -- Â  The field does not contain a value.           IS NOT NULL -- Â The field contains a value.     To match exact phrases: To set up a rule that matches an exact phrase in a text field, you can use the MATCHES REGULAR EXPRESSION operator and enter the exact phrase in the field. The CONTAINS operator treats each word entered independently, so it does not adequately set criteria for the specific sequence of words.  To set a criteria for a null value: You can set up rule criteria for a field with null values. You can use the EQUALS operator and enter two single quotes in the field, i.e. if organizations.name EQUALS '' (two single quotes). Another option is to use the NOT EQUALS operator with a percent sign, i.e. if organizations.name NOT EQUALS %. When creating rules, be sure to test your rule by submitting an incident from the incident source specified that matches the criteria in the IF section of the rule."

Once created, this mailbox will need to be manually configured for your site in the Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes section, using the details generated at step #1: a. Select New &gt; New Outreach Mailbox and fill in a name for this mailbox b. In the Outgoing Email section, fill in the Envelope From / Bounce Address c. If this will be the default outreach mailbox, be sure to check the Default box d. If this Outreach mailbox will also be accepting incoming emails, go to the Incoming email section and fill in the POP Server, POP Account and Password fields    Â Setting up a General Service or Outreach Mailbox  1. Since General Service or Outreach Mailboxes are not hosted by Oracle, you (or a third party) will need to create them on the server that will be hosting them. 2. The mailbox will then need to be added via Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes as either a service mailbox or an outreach mailbox. a. Select New &gt; New Outreach Mailbox or New Service Mailbox, depending on what type this will be used for, and fill in a name for the mailbox b. If this mailbox will send outgoing emails, in the Outgoing Email section, fill in the Envelope From / Bounce Address c. If this mailbox will process incoming emails, in the Incoming Email section, fill in the POP Server, POP Account and Password fields d. If this will be the default outreach or service mailbox, be sure to check the Default box.  Once the required mailboxes were created and setup, Oracle B2C Service's email management function, Email Gateway, will need to be enabled. Email Gateway (i.e. configuration setting EGW_ENABLED) is the master switch that controls whether incoming and outgoing emails are processed. Please refer to Â Answer ID 268: Enabling Email Gateway to allow incidents via email for details. II. Additional Setup Details With the basic setup complete, email processing should be operational. The information available below should cover some additional details and links for more in-depth mailbox setup  Message Templates   All outgoing emails on incidents and administrator emails use special per-interface Â templates that define how the message content is structured and formatted. You can also enable or disable these templates, according to your needs. Important: Keep in mind that disabling a message template means that specific interface will not be sending any email that would use that message template type. For additional information on message templates, refer to Answer ID 5380: Customizing notifications and email messages sent by Oracle B2C Service Â and see Core Features &gt; Message Templates in the Â online documentation for your version.    Â Techmail   Processing incoming emails (both for service and outreach mailboxes) is done by a utility called techmail. This utility should be enabled by default for production sites, while test or upgrade sites will require you to enable this utility from the Configuration Assistant self-service tool. For more information on the techmail utility, refer to: Answer ID 8745: What is Techmail On Demand? Answer ID 1361: What are techmail considerations I need to know? Answer ID 1067: Techmail messages in the Utility Stats page    Â Techmail Incoming Email Filtering   Techmail can filter incoming emails it finds in mailboxes based on aspects like address, headers, subject, body, MIME type and file type. See Â Answer ID 6492: Discard Filters on mailboxes for more details.    Â DomainKeys and DKIM   If your organization wants emails sent out from Oracle B2C Service to look like they are coming from your corporate domain (i.e. From: support@yourdomain.com), then you will need to modify the Friendly From/Branded Address field.     Click to enlarge image    This will require you to also setup DomainKeys and DKIM authentication. Please refer to Answer ID 2701: DomainKeys and DKIM email authentication configuration Note:You may also want to consider changing the Reply-To address field. See the next section for details.    Â SMTP Forwarding   If you want Â reply emails Â (i.e. emails that come from your customers when they Â click reply in their mail client to emails they got from a mailbox on your Oracle B2C Service site) to first go through your mail system Â before going into Oracle B2C Service, then you would need to setup an SMTP forward and change the Reply-to Address field for the given mailbox. For complete details, see Answer ID 1272: Using your organization's domain in the Sent email address of your Oracle B2C Service mailbox     Click to enlarge image    Note: If you are planning to update the Friendly From/Branded Address field, then also going through this setup would likely make sense for consistency. Also, you will want to forward any emails to the full mailbox address of your Oracle Hosted Mailbox which is in a format of mailbox@mail&lt;pod&gt;.custhelp.com i.e. mailbox@mailva.custhelp.com.    Â SPF and Sender ID   If you want to use your organization's branded domain in the Envelope From/ Bounce Address, then you will need to set up SPF/Sender ID to authorize Oracle to send on your behalf. Note: If you set this up you will be responsible for handling bounced messages. This means your domain will receive the bounces and these bounces should be redirected to the Oracle B2C Service mailbox so the system can react appropriately.     Click to enlarge image    In such cases, you will also need to redirect all messages BACK into the Oracle-hosted mailbox AND update your SPF records to include rnmk.com. Please refer to Â Answer ID 2489: SPF and Sender ID considerations with Oracle B2C Service sites for more details about these authentication technologies and what your SPF records should include.    Â Barracuda SPAM Filter   Before arriving in an Oracle-managed mailbox, Incoming email into Oracle-hosted Service Mailboxes will benefit from Barracuda SPAM filtering. For more information on this filtering system, refer to Answer ID 2345: Barracuda Spam filters on hosted Service mailboxes.    Â Oracle-managed mailbox security Â    To review what security Oracle provides with these mailboxes, Â please refer to Answer ID 9281: TLS protocol for hosted mailboxes.    Â Mailboxes on upgrade and test sites   When upgrade or test sites are created, their mailboxes will mirror your production site setup. However, they will all be disabled and their names will have '__tst#' (where # is a number) appended to them. To find out how to set them up for testing, refer to Answer ID 2145: Testing email responses from an upgrade or test site."

Routing incidents by the product, or category;Answer ID 346;Can I route incoming incidents to specific people based on the product, sub-product, etc?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 5168'];   Business Rules Oracle B2C Service  Issue   We want to route incoming incidents to specific people based on the product, sub-product, category, and sub-category names created for our site.;"  Incoming incidents can be routed based on specific values entered in the product, sub-product, category, and sub-category fields from the Ask a Question page. Incoming incidents get routed to staff or queues by Â business rules that you create. Incidents submitted via email do not have product or category values associated with the incident since there is no means for the user to set the field in the email itself. Incidents created from email requests have the product and category values set to Unspecified. To set up a rule that routes incidents by product or category value, use the steps below:  Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. Double-click Rules under Site Configuration. Â    Click the Incident button in the ribbon to view active incident rules. Â    Click the Edit button on the ribbon to enter the edit mode. Â    Right-click the state or function you want to add the rule to and select New Rule. Â    Add Â IF Condition based on Incident &gt; Source Â equals Ask a Question. Â    Add another IF Â Condition based on Incident &gt; Product and/or Incident &gt; Category. The screen will refresh and provide an operator menu and a list of products or categories. Â    Click the Add Action - Then button Â and select Set Field &gt; Assigned. Select the appropriate staff member from the drop-down menu. Â    When finished, click Save followed by Compile and Activate.

Utilities included with Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 348;Which utilities are included with theÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service applications?;['Answer ID 8689', 'Answer ID 1684', 'Answer ID 2728', 'Answer ID 7027', 'Answer ID 5470', 'Answer ID 8745', 'Answer ID 4551', 'Answer ID 5670'];   Utilities included with Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  Utilities are back end functionality that process data on your site. As such, there is no customer available configuration regarding their scheduling. Current utility schedules have been reviewed by subject matter experts and have been optimized for Oracle's infrastructure. While there are many different utilities with varying functions, a few of them are responsible for key functionality. When a utility fails it may temporarily affect available data or processes on your site. For information on some of the more visible utilities, please refer to the following list and the associated description. (In test sites, customers have the ability to enable and disable specified utilities through Configuration Assistant.) - agedatabase: This utility is responsible for regular maintenance on your database. Some functions include purging old information that is no longer required to help maintain the efficiency of your database, closing incidents with a status of Waiting, SLA instance expiration, setting incidents to dormant and setting answers to the Review status. This utility also caches report data for some reports and clusters answers if using the browse feature. Agedatabase is only run once per day during off hours so the aggregation of stats on cached tables will not be available in real time. It is designed to run in the background and on some sites can take as much as 10 hrs or more on a normal run. - agedatabase-a: This utility performs incident archiving and purges phrase data. Incident archiving allows closed incidents to be permanently deleted from the database for the purpose of managing your database size. The archive function permanently removes incident data from the tables and adds them as an XML file available through a report. - agedatabase-C: Utility that purges social monitor data.  - dataminer: This utility performs the summarization and statistical analysis of end user page hits and sessions. The utility executes hourly by default and summarizes the data in the clickstreams table to provide updates to the stats table and inserts to the cs_session_summary table. Dataminer runs on end user data that is 4 hours old therefore the newest end user statistics that are available are 4 hours old.  - dbstatus-l: This utility auto-generates product links. - dbstatus-e: This utility is responsible for sending application error notifications to the console. - dbstatus-m: This utility refreshes meta-answer visibilities. - dbstatus-p: This utility is responsible for populating private messaging from social channels like Facebook &amp; Twitter. - dbstatus-q: This utility checks round robin queues for overflow. - dbstatus-r: This utility is responsible for running rule escalations. - dbstatus-u: This utility is responsible for logging out inactive users. - dbstatus-w: This utility is responsible for sending out watchlist notifications.  - DQA: (Delayed Query Aggregator) DQA populates the clickstreams table of the database with raw data regarding end user page accesses, marketing tracked link accesses and answer statistics. It should be noted that when dqa is down (removed from the schedule) there will be no end user data or agent statistics to report on as dataminer and agedatabase are also removed from the schedule. This is to maintain data integrity as data dependencies exist between the three utilities.  - fa_cleaner: This utility automatically removes unused file attachments from the file attachment servers. No log files for this utility are included in the Utility Stats found in the support resources section of the ""Site Tools"" tab on the cx.rightnow.com end user pages. - keywordindexer: This utility creates an index of the keywords found in incidents, answers, file attachments, and documents indexed by the Web Indexer. The keyword indexes are used when searching incidents, answers, file attachments, and other indexed documents. Indexes may need rebuilt following actions like editing the exclude wordlist file in the File Manager. Incidents have a separate exclude file from the answers.  See also Answer 1684: Rebuilding and reindexing the phrases table.   - link_checker: This utility is responsible for confirming validity of destination links within the answer object.  See also Answer 2728: Checking for broken links in answers.   - reportgen-si: This utility sends scheduled reports per interface. - reportgen-q: This utility runs reports queued for long run time and operates serially (first-in-first-out) on a per interface basis. Please review Answer ID 7027: Long run time for reportgen-q as to how this functionality may affect your reporting.  - spm_scheduler: This utility is used for scheduling and executing back-end tasks and custom processes. No log files for this utility are included in the Utility Stats found in the support resources section of the ""Site Tools"" tab on the cx.rightnow.com end user pages.  - techmail-m and techmail-s: Techmail retrieves email from your configured outreach (techmail-m) or service mailboxes (techmail-s) to create new incidents or update existing incidents depending on your site configuration. Please note that email is not a real time support channel. Please review Answer ID 5470: Using support channels to satisfy a short response time for information on using support channels to meet short response requirements. - techmail-o: Techmail On Demand allows messages to be processed as they come into the mailbox. This feature is only available for Oracle hosted mailboxes and does not affect the route or timing between mail servers. It is important to note that while this will help to process messages sent to Oracle hosted mailboxes more quickly, it is still not considered a real time support channel. Refer to Answer ID 8745: What is Techmail On Demand? for more information.  See also:  Answer 4551: How to check utility status for my site (i.e. Techmail) Answer 5670: Techmail message filters explained     Utilities specific to Knowledge Advanced These utilities are only present if your site has Knowledge Advanced enabled. - IMBatchJobDaily: Sends answer subscription emails to users configured to receive them daily. Resynchronizes the category and product trees from Oracle B2C Service to Knowledge Advanced. Sends notification emails for scheduled content reviews and content expiration. Removes all personal information from Knowledge Advanced relating to deleted contacts. - IMBatchJobFifteenMin: Sends answer subscription emails to users configured to receive them immediately. Executes queued bulk updates to content. Publishes articles that have reached their scheduled start date. Runs the shadow account job if it has been queued.

Deleting a published answer;Answer ID 375;How do I delete a published answer?;['Answer ID 1960'];  Answers;" The specific steps to delete a published answer depend on which version of Oracle B2C Service you are using. The staff member must have the ability to delete answers enabled on their staff profile on the Service tab. Note: Be careful when deleting answers. Once deleted, there is no way to restore them. For this reason, you may wish to simply remove the Answer from public display by assigning it to a different answer status that is a private status type so that the answer is not shown on the end-user pages. You can delete an answer from a report grid or from an open answer. From a report grid, highlight the answer, right click and select Delete or click Home &gt; Delete. Â  To delete multiple answers, use the Shift or Ctrl key to select multiple records and then right click and select Delete. From an open record, click the Delete button.

Copying a report;Answer ID 378;How do I copy a report?;['Answer ID 2566'];  Analytics; The specific steps for copying a report depend on which version of Â Oracle Â you are using. Â You can create a copy of both standard and custom reports, including the Answers Viewed, Staff Performance, or Service Summary reports, for example. When creating a copy of a custom report, create the copy first -- without making changes to the current report. Then, open up the copy to make your changes. If copying a report with schedules or alerts, only the report will be copied. Â  The schedules Â and alerts are not Â copied over Â to the new report. This ensures that recipients of the original report do not receive additional reports for copies that are created at a later time or are sent to unintended recipients. Note: You can export report configurations from one site and then import them into another site. For more information, refer to Answer ID 2566: Exporting and Importing Report Configurations. Â  To copy a report: From the Analytics button, in the left-hand frame, click the Reports Explorer.  Â  In the right hand frame, right click on the report you would like to copy, and select Copy.  Â  In the pop-up window, select the Â interface to copy the report to.  Â  Click the directory and folder where you would like to save your copy. Folders not accessible for the interface you selected are grayed out.  Â  In the Name field, enter a new name for the copy of the report and click Save. From the Reports Explorer, you can right click on the copy of the report and select Edit to edit your copy. Once you have modified the copy of the report, save your changes. Double click on the report name in the explorer to verify the contents and display of your new report. If you are editing an existing report, you can click the Save icon and select Save As to create a copy of the report you are editing. When the new copy of the report is saved, the name of the report changes above the toolbar and you will be editing the report that you just created. That is, if you open Report A and click Save As and save the report as Report B, you will now be editing Report B. Note: When a report is copied, it retains the information from the original report, including the original title. To update the title of the report, double-click on the Title field or right click and select Edit Text Field. In the pop-up window, update the contents of the Text field. You can also delete the field. To add a new title field, click the Insert tab at the top of the page, and click Text Field. Select the text field you want. Then, click the location in the report to drop the new field. Right click on the text field to make changes.

Some waiting incidents are not getting set to Solved;Answer ID 382;Why don't some of my incidentsÃ‚Â get set to solved after a certain period of time even though I have configured the CI_HOURS configuration setting?;['Answer ID 2566'];   Utilities, Agedatabase, Configuration Settings;"  The agedatabase utility compares the time_respond field in the Oracle B2C Service database to the value in the CI_HOURS configuration setting to determine if the incident has been in the waiting state long enough to be set to solved. If incidents set to Waiting are not getting set to Solved, there are a few things to consider: If NO Waiting incidents are getting set to Solved: Â  Check the Site Tools &gt; Utility Stats page to confirm agedatabase is running. If errors are encountered, submit a service request to Ask Technical Support to investigate further.  If only SOME Waiting incidents are not getting set to Solved: Â  If you have a multi-interface site, verify that the CI_HOURS setting for Â the interface associated with the incidents Â has a positive value. Â  Â Setting CI_HOURS in an interface Â to zero turns off the feature in that interface. Â  Â Incidents are set to Solved based on the CI_HOURS of the assigned interface. Â  Therefore, if CI_HOURS is set to zero in an interface, waiting incidents assigned to that interface do not automatically get set to solved. In addition, review the status that the incidents are being set to and verify that the status type is set to Waiting. For example, if staff members set incidents to a custom status, make sure that the custom status is a Waiting status type. To check the status type, use the steps below. 1. The path is Configuration &gt; Application appearance &gt; Customizable Menus &gt; System Menus 2. Select Incident Statuses to see a list of current statuses and their status types If the status type is not Waiting, you must create a new custom status to replace the existing one. It is not possible to edit the status type of an existing incident status.  If incidents are getting set to solved after more hours have passed Â than is configured in Â CI_HOURS: The agedatabase utility only runs once a day. Â  Â Incidents are closed Â at the time Â the utility runs Â runs Â if the incident has been in a waiting status for more than CI_HOURS. Â  Â Depending on when the incident was set to waiting, the incident might be set to Solved almost 24 hours after the CI_HOURS setting. Â  CI_HOURS works in conjunction with CI_WAITING_CALC_DAYS. Â  This setting defines the days that agedatabase will include when calculating how long an incident has been in the Waiting state. The format is ""SuMTuWThFSa."" If left blank, agedatabase will include all days. Default is SuMTuWThFSa.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key."

Determining which message base to edit;Answer ID 383;Is there a way to more easily find the message base I want?;['Answer ID 768', 'Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   Message Bases Oracle B2C Service, All versions  Issue   There are so many message bases, I find it difficult to find the one that I would like to edit.;"  Message bases are text strings that are used throughout your Oracle B2C Service application. For example, the tab names on the end-user pages are defined by message bases. With the large number of message bases available in Oracle B2C Service it can be challenging to find the appropriate message base to edit. Message bases are accessed from the Navigation Pane &gt; Configuration &gt;Site Configuration &gt; Message Bases. You can easily search the message bases (by Key) and then make edits. Administration areas of the product related to end-user visible messaging may include code that utilizes the message base keys.  Â Some examples where this is the case are the administration areas for Customer Portal Â and Message Templates.  Â The Message Base editor also provides additional search options such as by interface, folder, text and custom text.  Â These options Â allow Â administrators to search for the currently displayed labels in order to find message base keys that contain that text.  Â    Profile Permission Â required:  Â Staff members can edit message bases only if their staff profile allows it. Â The staff profile must have the Configuration option enabled on the Â Administration tab under their profile Permissions. For additional information, refer to the 'How the Message Bases Editor Works' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Note: Â  Not all text within your application is controlled by message bases.  Field names in workspaces are defined within the workspace itself. If the field is used in multiple workspaces, you must update each workspace separately.  Â  To modify the label of a field in an incident workspace, open the workspace for editing and click on the field. In the Properties section, edit the Label Text property to modify the label used with that field. To include a hotkey for the label, use an ampersand (&amp;) immediately prior to the hotkey. Â    Similarly, when defining custom fields, the name of the custom field is defined when you add and configure that field. Â There is no message base that corresponds to the name used for a custom field. You can change the label for custom fields within a workspace as well."

Using Incident Source when creating incident rules;Answer ID 385;When creating rules for routing and handling incidents, what does Incident Source refer to?;['Answer ID 2611'];   Business RulesÃ‚Â  Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  When creating rules for incidents, the Incident Source specifies where the incident originated. The Â Source field applies to all record types in the application. Â  As a result, the source for all record types (such as incidents, contacts, answers, and opportunities) are included in a two-tier hierarchical structure. The first level of the Source hierarchy are major components of the application such as:  CX Console (the Oracle B2C Service Console) End-User pages Utilities (including techmail) etc.  The second level of the hierarchy is the specific source of the record, such as Incident Editor or Â the Ask a Question page.  Incident workspaces: By default, the Source field is included on the Details tab of the default incident workspace. This allows agents to determine Â how the Â incident was created. The most common sources for incidents are:  Incident Editor (under CX Console) Ask a Question (under End-User Pages) Utilities &gt; Techmail - Service Mailbox Utilities &gt; Techmail - Outreach Mailbox (when people reply to a mailing) Chat (under CX Console)  In addition, incidents can also be created with the following sources:  Feedback on Answers (under End-User Pages) Site Feedback (under End-User Pages) External Events and Public SOAP API (under Public API)  Source used in incident rules: Â  When configuring an incident rule, you can include the incident Source field to the IF criteria of the rule. Â Click Add condition based on and select Incident &gt; Source. When the Incident.Source criteria is added to the rule, by default all sources are enabled. Modify the source list as you need to create the IF condition for your rule. Â  You can leave non-incident sources Â (such as Answer Editor or Contact Editor) enabled if you wish. Since no incidents are created from those sources, it does not matter if those sources are enabled or disabled in your IF criteria.  For a complete list of source codes, refer to the Data Dictionary."

Mail protocols used for mail transfer in Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 401;What mail protocols does Oracle B2C Service use for mail transfer?;['Answer ID 2611'];   Outgoing / Incoming Email;  There are two protocols Oracle B2C Service uses for mail transfer -- SMTP and POP3. Mail is sent by the Oracle B2C Service CGI program through SMTP. ALL outgoing email is sent through SMTP at the time the CGI runs. This means that while the CGI is running (before the next page is loaded), the outgoing mail is sent to the various people. A slow SMTP connection will result in some pages loading slowly in your application if mail is sent at the same time. POP3 is used by Oracle B2C Service and the techmail utility for mail coming into the Oracle B2C Service application, that is mail sent to a mailbox configured in your site. SMTP is used in the process only when sending the receipts for new incidents. POP3 works well through a network -- dial-up is not necessary. POP3 is fast enough to work with a high volume Oracle B2C Service site. Troubleshooting tips include:        To test your POP3 mailbox, set up a truly POP3 compliant client. This should not be Outlook if your mail server is Exchange. Use Netscape Messenger or Mozilla Thunderbird Â to connect to your mailbox account. If the connection does not go through, then Oracle B2C Service cannot work. Â            You can also use Netscape Messenger to test your outgoing SMTP connection. Â            If your server is Exchange, be sure to load all the requirements for a POP3 compliant mailbox. This is not the default for Exchange.

Moving a public answer up or down in the display order;Answer ID 409;Besides relying on the answer's score, is there a way I can move a public answer up or down in the display order?;['Answer ID 2379', 'Answer ID 2492', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, Display Postion Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  When editing an answer, the Display Position menu allows you to easily change the display position of your public answers. By default, the Display Position field is included on the Details tab. The settings and descriptions for the Display Position feature are listed below. When placing an answer in the list, both the Score and the Computed Score values are affected. When fixing an answer, only the Computed Score is affected. To better determine how the score and computed score Â  are affected, you can create a report or view that lists your answers and includes output columns for the score and computed score values from the answers table. Then, after editing an answer and changing the display position, run the report to see the effect on the score and computed score values for that answer.        Historical Usefulness - This uses the score to adjust the ranking of the answers. This is the default display position. Â            Place at Top - Â This places the answer at the top of the answer list (one time only) by setting the score to be a value equal to the highest score for any answer in the database. The placed answer then reverts to Historical Usefulness, and if the answer is reopened the Display Position field will be set to Historical Usefulness. Â  Â The answer may drop to a lower position if end-users view other answers so that their score increases to exceed the answer that was placed at the top of the list.           Place at Middle - This places the answer at a level that is 50% of the highest score (one time only) for any answer in the database. The answer then reverts to Historical Usefulness. The answer will rise or fall in the list based on the score as it is affected by end-user viewing activity. Â            Place at Bottom - This places the answer at the bottom of the Answer list (one time only) by setting the score and computed score to 0. The answer then reverts to Historical Usefulness. The answer may rise in the list of answers as the score increases based on end-user activity. Â            Fix at Top - This permanently fixes the answer at the top of the Answer list. With this option, the computed score of the answer is affected instead of the score.           Fix at Middle - This permanently fixes the answer at a level that is 50% of the maximum score. When fixing an answer in a position, the computed score is affected, not the score.  Â            Fix at Bottom - This permanently fixes the answer at the bottom of the Answer list. When fixing an Answer in a position, the computed score is affected, not the score.     Additional Considerations  Fixing Multiple Answers in a Position: If you fix multiple answers in a position, by default, those answers will be listed by answer ID in Â ascending order. If you would like to fix multiple answers in a position, consider adding an additional sorting value so that you can control the sort order of multiple answers that are saved with the Fix at Top option. For more information on configuring the sort order for the answers published to your end-user pages, Â refer to Answer ID 2379: Optimal Sort Order for Published Answers.  Multiple Interfaces: If you have multiple interfaces on your site, the scores for answers are not tracked for individual interfaces. That is, when you place or fix an answer's display position, the score or computed score is affected based on all public answers in the database, not just the answers published to a specific interface. As a result, you may place an answer at the top of an interface, and its score may be set to be considerably larger than expected if another interface has an answer with a very high score. For example, if the highest score for an answer in interface A is 1000 and the highest score for an answer in interface B is 20,000, if you use the Place at Top option, the score of the answer will be 20,000 -- even if you are publishing the answer to interface A.  Text Search Results: When fixing an answer in a certain position, this does not affect the results ordering when a text search is performed. When a text search is performed, the answers are listed based on the matched weights that are calculated for each answer as to how well the answer matches the search string. As a result, if you fix an answer at the top of the list of answers, when a search is performed, that answer will NOT necessarily be at the top of the search results. If other answers have a higher matched weight, the answer that is fixed at top will not be at the top of the list when the text search is performed. If you want an answer to be listed first in a set of search results regardless of the matched weight, consider setting that answer up as a Search Priority Â Word. For more information on configuring this, refer to Answer ID 2492: Configuring Search Priority Words and Recommended Documents.  For additional information, refer to the 'Adding an Answer' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Manually matching an answer to another answer's Related Answers results;Answer ID 410;Can I manually match an answer to another answer's Learned Links / Related Answers results?;['Answer ID 411'];   Answers, Relationships;"  You Â can manually create relationships between answers that display on your end-user pages. Â You can also view answers that the application determines to be related to an answer based on end-user paths and viewing patterns. Â  The Related Answers feature in Oracle B2C Service takes into account the score, keyword searching, phrases and natural language used in the Question and Answer fields as well as end-user activity when viewing multiple answers within a session. Note: If you wish to link directly to another answer from within the content of an answer, you can Â add a link directly to another answer from Â within the Answer field. For information about creating a link directly to another answer, refer to Answer ID 411: Creating a link to a public answer from another public answer. Manually-related answers: When editing an answer, the Manually Related Answers Â section on the Relationships tab allows you to select specific answers to display at the bottom of the end-user page when the answer is viewed. Â  On the end-user pages, manually related answers are listed under the heading Answers others found helpful. The list of answers in the Manually Related Answers section is not subject to automatic updates based on end-user activity or link data within the application. Â  The answers listed in this section are maintained manually by adding or removing answers or promoting answers from the Learned Link section. Manual relationships are not Â reciprocal between the answers. Â  That is, if you open answer 5 in your site and add answer 10 to the Manually Related Answers section, this does not automatically add answer 5 to the Manually Related Answers section in answer 10. If you wish to have the manual relationship established both ways, you must open answer 10 and add answer 5 as a manually-related answer. System-related answers: The Learned Links section on the Relationships tab displays answers that are related to the answer as determined by the application based on end-user link activity. On the end-user pages, answers listed in the Learned Links section of an answer display under the heading Users who viewed this answer have also viewed. The Learned Links feature Â operates the way Related Answers did in previous versions where the application determines relationships and patterns between answers based on end-user activity. Answers listed in the Learned Links section are subject to change based on additional end-user activity. Promoting learned link answers: If you wish to ensure that an answer listed in the Learned Links section remains associated with the answer, you can promote that answer to be listed in the Manually Related Answers section Â and enforce a specific relationship between the answers. On the Relationships tab, highlight the answer and click Promote. The answer is removed from the Learned Links section and added to the Manually Related Answers section. Â  Note that once an answer is promoted, Â you cannot Â demote it back to the Learned Links section  Blocking learned link answers: If you determine that an answer listed in the Learned Link section should be removed, highlight the answer and click the Block/Unblock button. The answer is updated to display Yes in the Blocked column of the table. When you save the answer, Â that answer will no longer display in the ""Users who have viewed this answer have also viewed section"" of the end-user pages. If you determine at a later time, that the learned link answer should no longer be blocked, highlight the answer and click the Block/Unblock button and save the answer."

Creating a link to a public answer from another public answer;Answer ID 411;How do I create a link to a public answer from another public answer?;['Answer ID 1581', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, HTML Editor, All versions;"  The HTML editor is always enabled when editing answers. How to link to another answer depends on if you are in Design mode or Source mode. Design mode: If you are in Design mode, click the Answer Link icon from the editor option Â (in 17D and earlier, click the Insert Answer Link option from the Toolbox). In the pop-up window, enter the answer ID and link text Â of the answer you are linking to. When using this option, the application automatically generates the underlying link format. You can view the underlying code by clicking the Source option. In addition, you can enter other attributes associated with the link such as the title, target and anchor attributes.  Link Text - The text you want to appear to customers. Note, if this field is left blank, Answer Link will display to customers. Title - The text you want to appear to customers when they hover over the link title. Target - The target location where you want the contents of the link to display. Note, if you want the answer to open in the current window, leave this field blank. Anchor - Type the answer in this field to link to a specific location in a long string of text in an answer. This allows customers to link to the exact location.   Source mode: If using the Source mode to enter HTML code for your answer content, to create a link to another answer, use the format below: &lt;rn:answer_xref answer_id=""y"" /&gt; where y is the Answer ID of the answer you would like to link to. Note that the quotation marks are required when using this format. The ending space and slash ( / ) are also required. With this format, you can also customize the text that is used to create the link by adding a text attribute to specify the text to use. The format to use is: &lt;rn:answer_xref contents=""Custom text here"" answer_id=""y"" //&gt;  Example of Link to Another Answer: The example below shows what is typed in the answer and what appears to the end-user.

Using the Help Access Level;Answer ID 412;What is the Help access level used for?;['Answer ID 5894'];   Answers, Access Levels;"  The help access level allows you to give users access to the answer content via the app/answers/detail/a_id/&lt;ID&gt; page but it does not allow the answer to show up on the answer list page or to be returned in search results. The Help access level allows answers to operate in ""stealth"" mode. Help Access Level -- Visibility box is NOT checked: When the Visibility box is disabled / Â clear for the Help access level, it has special functionality and does NOT behave the same as a custom access level used with privileged access. If an answer has a public status and is assigned to Help (Visibility box is not checked):   The answer does NOT display on the answers list page.   When searching on a word in the answer, the answer does NOT display in the search results.   *** If you go to the URL for the answers/detail page with that answer ID, the answer DOES display to the user -- even if they are not logged in. ***   This functionality allows you to do the following things:   Link directly to a Help answer from another page in you site and not have that Help answer display in the Answers list page or in search results. You can even link to a Help answer from another published answer.   Create specific Help answers that can be included in incident responses but not listed in the Answers list page. Agents could append a link or answer text for a Help answer into an incident without publishing the answer to the knowledge base.   Note: Â  Answers assigned to the Help access level do not display in the related answers widget when viewing another answer that is related. However, the Â answer assigned to the Â Help access level does display in the previously viewed answers if the user goes on to view other answers within a session. Since the user was able to view the answer at one point, it allows users to easily view the answer again within that session. Help Access Level -- Visibility box IS checked: When the visibility box is enabled for the Help access level, it works just like a regular Everyone type access level.   The answer displays on the Answers list page.   If I search on a word in the answer, it displays in the search results.   The user can view the answer on the standard answers detail page.   For information on Answer Access visibility and the Help access level, refer to Answer ID 5894: Answer Access Visibility."

Creating and using system and answer variables;Answer ID 415;What are variables and how are they created and used?;['Answer ID 1280', 'Answer ID 2309', 'Answer ID 1266', 'Answer ID 5168'];   System and Answer Variables Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  In Oracle B2C Service, there are two types of variables -- user-defined answer variables that can be included in answers and system variables than can be used with incidents and standard text responses.  System Variables  System Variables are defined within the Oracle B2C Service application. System variable Â return specific values from the database fields and tables for incidents, contacts, or organizations. For example, the database field ""Contacts - First Name"" can be used when responding to incidents directly or used within a standard text response. System variables allow you to personalize standard responses by including specific values pertinent to the incident, contact or organization record. For more information on using system-defined variables, refer to Answer ID 1280: Personalizing automated incident responses. You can include system variables within a standard text response. Then, you can use rules to append the Â standard text to incident responses. Note: Â  You can also Â use rules to append standard text to the incident Notes field. Â  When standard text are appended to the Notes field, system variables within the standard response remain as system variables and are not replaced with the actual database value. System variables included in the Response field are resolved to display the database value.  Â Custom (Answer) Â Variables  Answer variables are user-defined ""short cuts"" that allow a staff member to enter the variable instead of a longer string of text when creating or editing an answer. Variables can be entered in the Question and Answer fields of an answer. You can use variables in both answers and Â incidents. When the incident is saved, the variable is converted so that the content of the variable is saved within the incident. Â  The content of the variable is what is sent and visible to your end-users. Â  Using answer variables not only saves time by using a short cut for the longer text string, but it also eliminates typographical and spelling errors that may occur. In addition, if the text associated with the variable were to change, you could simply edit the value of the variable so that the text would be updated all at once without having to edit each answer separately. When adding or editing an answer, to use the variable you create, type a dollar sign followed by the variable name, such as $CONTACT. When you save the answer, the variable is replaced with the assigned value specified in the var2intf table. For example, a variable named Â osvc could be created so that when $osvc is entered into an answer, the words Â Oracle B2C Service are displayed. Naming Considerations You can search on the variable name to find the answers that contain that variable. For example, if you have a variable named ADRS that defines the mailing address for your company, you can search on ADRS to find all the answers that include that variable. For this reason, when creating variables, you may want to use names that are not actual words or commonly used acronyms. This allows you to easily find answers that contain the variable. If you use a variable with the name ADDRESS, when you search on that variable, you will get all answers that contain the ADDRESS variable along with any other answers that include the word ""Address"".  HTML in variables You can include HTML code in variables. Â  You must enter the actual code within the Value field of the variable. Â  That is, if you wish to include a link within a variable, you must include the a href Â HTML tag similar to: Â &lt;a href=""url_of_interest.com""&gt;Link text&lt;/a&gt;. Â  Similarly, if you wish to bold specific words in Â the variable, you must include the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; tags around the word. One caveat to using HTML in a variable is the management of a conditional section using variables.  Â Once the conditional section is started the rest of the answer will be hidden because the ending of the conditional, when used in a variable, is also hidden and thus unable to process the ending of the conditional section.  Â To learn more about conditional sections within an answer please view Adding conditional sections to published answers.  Â  Displaying $ in Text Strings If the character immediately following a $ sign is numeric, the character sequence is NOT treated as a variable. This means that monetary units can be entered as normal. Managing Variables Â  You can manage your answer variables for all interfaces while being logged in to one interface. The Interface drop-down menu allows you to select which interface you are defining the variable for. When you change the Interface menu, the variable that is used for that interface displays in the text area field. This allows you to use one variable across multiple interfaces, but define specific content for each interface. If the text area field is blank, then the variable is not defined for that interface and the variable will not render on the end-user pages of that interface. If you are using the same variable content across multiple interfaces, you must copy and enter the content for each interface value. For example, you can have a variable named COMPANY that uses the content ""Company A"" for one interface and ""Company B"" for another interface. That way, when the variable is used in an answer, the correct company name will display when viewed from the end-user pages for that interface. You can also specify whether your answer variable should be indexed or not. For more information regarding indexing, refer to Answer ID 1266: Impact of Indexing a Custom Field. To add an answer variable, use the steps below:  From the Service Administration Â items select Content Library &gt; (Answer) Variables.   Right click in the left-hand frame and select Add Variable.   Enter the name of the variable in the Name text box.   Select which interface you are defining the variable for.   Enter the text string for the variable being defined. Â    If appropriate, select a different interface from the Interface menu and define the variable for another interface.   Click Add.   Add the variable to an answer and preview the answer to verify that it displays as you wish as defined for that interface.   For additional information, refer to the 'Add or Edit a Variable' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Troubleshooting slow page loads;Answer ID 421;Oracle B2C Service is responding slowly when loading pages. What can be done to correct this?;['Answer ID 1104'];   Site Performance;  Slow response time may be caused by one of several factors or a combination of these factors. If you believe the speed of your Oracle B2C Service implementation is slow -- that is, other internet connections load more quickly -- consider the possible causes listed below.  Response time may be affected due to issues beyond the control of Oracle B2C Service, such as: firewalls, routers, and/or Internet issues. Review our Hosted Site Status page to determine if any issues are posted. Some maintenance and adjustment operations on Oracle servers can slow down speed on certain sites. Our Cloud Operations group tries to reduce these operations during peak hours but sometimes slowdown is unavoidable. If slowness is frequent, constant, or unacceptably long, submit an Ask Technical Support and include the information requested below. While slowness may be caused by factors outside Oracle B2C Service's control, some steps can be taken. When submitting an Ask a Question request related to slowness issues, please provide the following information with your request:  Note the times of slowness, and state if the slowness is constant or intermittent. Does slowness seem to occur at certain times of the day?   Include in the description of the incident any observations, database configurations, server operations, internet speed other network operation that might be affecting the network. What else is going on with the server? Do other programs that are network related respond slowly?   Include the average time of page loading.   Attach traceroute files when the words ALL TIME are in the tr.rightnow file and slowness occurs while loading certain pages.  Note: Use the directions in this Â answer to perform a traceroute. Â  Refer to Answer ID 1104: Running a Traceroute. Â   Additional Consideration: If the end-user pages are slow in loading, but your administration pages are loading in a timely manner, this could be due to issues with the stylesheet used for the site, particularly if you are using a custom stylesheet located on another server. If the server on which your stylesheet resides is slow or unreachable, then your end-user pages will also be slow or unreachable. Evaluate the server where your stylesheet resides to determine if there are any performance issues there.

Testing business rule configurations;Answer ID 434;How do I test our business rules?;['Answer ID 1873', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;" You Â can configure rules for incidents, answers, contacts, Â organizations or tasks. If Â Chat is enabled, rules can be configured for handling Â Chat sessions. If Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service is enabled, rules can also be configured for sales opportunities. When testing rules, you must create an appropriate data record Â type so that the record matches the IF conditions specified in the rule. This includes IF criteria such as Incident Source, Assigned, or Answer Status. To check if the appropriate rule acted upon your test item, use the rule log. The rule log lists both the rule name and the time that it acted on the record. This allows you to correlate the date and time from the rule log to the date and time of when the record was created or saved. The rule log is found in the Common Configuration menu &gt; Rules &gt; Rule Log. For more information on the rule log, refer to Answer 1873: Using the Rule Log. Note: There is no rule log for Chat Note: The rules feature also allows rules to apply to existing, modified records in addition to new items added to the database. To test rules that are applied to modified records, you must first create the test item (such as a test incident or test contact record), and then edit that record so that it matches the criteria of the rule to be matched. You may need to modify the record several times so that you are basically manipulating the record through your rules to test a specific rule.

Automatically suggesting solutions for Ask a Question requests;Answer ID 453;How can I configure Oracle B2C Service to respond to incoming incidents with SmartAssistant suggested solutions?;['Answer ID 1053'];   SmartAssistant Suggested Solutions, Business Rules, Ask a Question;"  Before the incident is created, we would like the application to display relevant answers for the submitter to review. You can configure your Â Oracle B2C Service site so that when end-users submit an incident from your Ask Â A Question Â page, the application evaluates the text in the question and determines the answers that best match. Then, these suggested Â answers are displayed to the end-user for their consideration. Â  If the suggested answers do not resolve the issue, the end-user Â can then continue submitting the incident. By configuring your site this way, you provide one last opportunity for end-users to resolve their own issues before submitting the incident to your Â support staff. When configuring your site to suggest answers for Ask a Question requests, you have two options:  Option 1: Â  Create a business rule that appends the system-defined SmartAssistant Response to the Solution field of the incident.  You can configure the rule to Â display the suggested Â solutions to the end-user pages independently of appending the solutions to the incident thread itself. That is, you can configure the suggested solutions to display during the submittal process without having them included in the incident thread.  Smart Assistant will not display without the use of the following widget in your ask.php page:  Â &lt;rn:widget path=""input/SmartAssistantDialog""/&gt;  If you wish to customize the content that is Â displayed to your end-users, you must use option 2 as well.   Option 2: Â  Create a custom standard text response that includes the $solutions variable. Â  Then create a business rule that appends that standard text to the Solution field of the incident.  Incidents submitted via email: Â  To include suggested solutions with incoming email requests sent to a mailbox, you must first create a standard text response to append to the incident response. Then you must create a Â rule to Â append the standard response to the incident. The Append SmartAssistant Response to Â Response Field option when creating Â business rules does not work if the incident comes into the system via email. Â  Since the incident is submitted to a mailbox, there is no way to provide suggested solutions before the email is processed and becomes an incident.  Â Instead you must create your own response and append it using a rule.  Number of solutions suggested: Â  When configuring suggested solutions, you can define the maximum number of answers that can be suggested. Â  Â The Â SA_NL_MAX_SUGGESTIONS configuration setting specifies the maximum number of SmartAssistant solutions that are suggested. Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key When using suggested solutions, you can also restrict the suggested answers to be from the same product or category as the incident that is submitted. For more information on doing this, refer to Answer ID 1053: Restricting Suggested Solutions by Product or Category.  Option 1: Configuring a Â Rule to Display SmartAssistant Suggested Answers Â with Ask a Question Requests  The most direct way to suggest answers to end-users when they submit an incident through the Ask a Question page is to create a rule that includes the action Append SmartAssistant Response to Response Field. This approach uses system-defined content to display the suggested solutions. When the end-user submits the Ask a Question request, if there are answers in the knowledge base that closely match the content of the incident, the user sees a screen that says:  Preliminary Response to Question The following answers may be relevant to your question:  This heading is followed with links to the suggested answers along with a button that allows the user to submit the incident if the suggestions did not answer their question. Â  If you wish to customize the content that displays to your end-user, you must create a custom standard text and use the approach described in Â the section below.  Rule configuration: Â  Â To create a rule that displays suggested solutions to your end-users, configure the rule as defined below for the appropriate release. Â  To Â edit Â the incident rules, use the path: Configuration &gt; Site Configuration, select Rules. From the ribbon click on Incident and then click the Â Edit button. Â  Once you have updated the rules, be sure to compile and activate them for use. There are two distinct incident Â sources that can be enabled for the rule. Â  Â   End-User Pages &gt; Ask a Question. Â  Use this source to append the suggested solutions to the incident response thread. This source option does not display the Â suggested solutions Â during the submittal process. Â    End-User Pages &gt; SmartAssistant on Ask a Question. Use this source to display the suggested solutions to the end-user pages during the submittal process. Â  The suggested solutions are not appended to the incident itself.  In the IF part of the rule, you can use one source or the other or you can enable both sources if you want the solutions to display both during the submittal process AND to be appended to the incident. Â  In the THEN part of the rule, include the action Append SmartAssistant Response to Response Field. For example, to only display the suggested solutions during the submittal process, configure the rule to look like: IF Incident Source equals End-User Pages: SmartAssistant on Ask a Question  Â  THEN Add Action &gt; Append Thread &gt; Append SmartAssistant Response to Â Response Field Â  In this case, if you also want to append the solutions to the incident response field, then enable both the SmartAssistant on Ask a Question AND the Ask a Question box in the Incident Source field in the rule. When using this approach, with both sources enabled, Â the suggested Â solutions display both during the submittal process AND the solutions are appended to the incident thread.    Option 2: Â  Configuring Smart Assistance Responses with a Custom Standard Text Response  When configuring your site to suggest solutions to your users, you can customize the content that displays on the page with the suggested solutions. For example, you can include a bolded statement to instruct users that they have not yet submitted their request and that they must still click the Finish Submitting button. To customize the message that displays with the suggested solutions, Â you must create a standard text response and then use a rule to append that standard response to the Â response thread Â of the incident. Â  To create a standard text, use the path Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Â Standard Text. Â  To include links to suggested answers from your knowledge base in your standard response, you must append the SmartAssistant Solutions variable Â in the standard text Â response. The variable displays as $SOLUTIONS within the standard response.  When creating the standard text item, the content in the HTML field is what displays to the end-users during the submittal process from the Ask a Question page.  Â  In the HTML field of the standard text, use HTML code to format your response. This includes adding paragraph tags or line breaks as well as font style and colors as appropriate.   The content of the Â HTML Value field is what can Â be appended to the incident response thread and becomes part of the incident.  NOTE: Where an HTML value does not exist, the Text content will be used. For example, you could use the following content in the HTML field Â so that Â it displays immediately to the end-user when submitting the Ask a Question request: These answers were automatically selected for your consideration. If your issue is addressed in our public answers, the solution link should be listed below. If no solutions are listed or the solutions do not match your issue, then there were no public Answers matching your issue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Click the Finish Submitting Question button below to submit your issue to our support staff. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; $SOLUTIONS  Rule configuration: Â  When configuring the rule, the THEN part of the rule includes the action Append Response Template to Response field. Â  If the standard text is also supposed to be sent to the end-user, include the action Email &gt; Â Send Email Response to Sender."

Limit to the number of mailboxes that Oracle B2C Service can support;Answer ID 459;Is there a limit to the number of mailboxes thatÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service can support?;['Answer ID 2518'];  Mailboxes configured in Oracle B2C Service; There is no hard-coded upper limit on the number of mailboxes Â that Oracle B2C Service can support -- that is, the number of mailboxes that can be defined in the Mailboxes table. For mailboxes not hosted with Oracle B2C Service: There are practical limitations as to the number of mailboxes that can be supported. Since techmail runs at given intervals, by default once every 15 minutes, your mail server must be able to process all of the mail between consecutive techmail runs. That is, if techmail runs every 15 minutes, your mail server must process the email in all mailboxes within the 15 minute interval. It is not recommended to run techmail processes on top of each other. The amount of mail that a server can process within a given time interval depends on the type of server, i.e., processing speed, and the size of the email messages that need to be processed. When adding new mailboxes for use with Oracle B2C Service, take into account the amount of mail your mail server can process between techmail runs. For mailboxes hosted with Oracle B2C Service: Â When techmail runs, a lock file is inserted when the utility process is initiated for a mailbox. This file is removed when the techmail process is finished for that mailbox. Before another techmail process can begin for that site, the lock file must be removed. Therefore, the limitations to the number of mailboxes does not apply for mailboxes hosted by Oracle B2C Service.

After zipping up your file, please use the steps below to provide such files.  Using a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client, connect to ftp.rightnowtech.com. Â    Log in as ""anonymous"", and use your full email address as the password. Â    Change directories to the ""incoming"" directory. For example, for command line clients use: cd incoming  Â  Note: You are unable to view any existing files at this location. Â    Upload the file Â   Â  For example, for command line clients enter: put file.txt Â    Exit from the FTP connection. Â    Update your incident and provide the file name to your Oracle B2C Service contact so that they can easily access the file.  To Access Files from Oracle B2C Service Â Technical Support  Technical Support Â may provide large files for you via FTP, which you can download via FTP. With regard to the file transfer, we will provide you a URL that you can access from a browser. From the URL, you will see the name(s) of the file(s) to download."

Length of time to create an incident after it is submitted;Answer ID 469;How long does it take for an incident to be created and display in the administrative console after the customer submits it?;['Answer ID 2518'];  Oracle B2C Service, Incident Creation; Incidents submitted Â via the Ask a Question page enter the system immediately, because the end-user pages work directly with the database. Incidents submitted via email take between one to fifteen minutes to enter the system. Emails are converted to incidents and brought into the application by the techmail utility, which is generally scheduled to run every fifteen minutes. Incidents submitted via Chat enter the system immediately. Â  However, it depends on the way Chat is configured. Â  Chat Â can be configured to not Â create an incident, create an incident at the beginning of the session or at the end of the session. Â  Â   Â

Proactively monitoring email to assure it is working correctly;Answer ID 475;How can I proactively monitor my email to assure it is working correctly?;['Answer ID 1853'];   Incoming E-mail;  Oracle B2C Service includes several features that allow you to monitor your site's performance with regard to email submitted to mailboxes configured in the Mailboxes table and the conversion of email into incidents. Error Log:  When certain errors are encountered during the techmail run, the errors are recorded in the System Error Log. If a staff member's profile has the System Error Log box checked on the Common tab, that staff member can access the error log to review errors associated with the techmail utility. In addition, if the System Error message is enabled, staff members who can access the Error Log also receive a notification in their Communication Center, indicating that a new system error has been recorded. This allows staff members to investigate errors and their causes. For more information on the System Error Log, refer to Answer 1853: System Error Log. Â  Â   Techmail Logs:  Customers also have access to the utility statistics for their sites. Click Â the 'Site Tools' link, verify your credentials (if prompted) and then click the Â Utility Stats link under the Hosting Services section. On the Utility Portal page, select the techmail option for the interface in question. Each techmail run is listed with the date and time of the run and a message indicating if any problems were encountered. If an error occurred, it most likely generated an Email Gateway Error. For more information on the messages, click Message Definitions on the Utility Runs page. Â   Service Summary Report: The Service Summary report includes the count of incidents created from the Ask a Question page, Email, and the Support Console. Use the Service Summary report to monitor the number of incidents created from email over specified time periods. This report gives you information on new incidents for all mailboxes. Â   Custom Report by Mailbox: Consider creating a custom report to count all incidents created from individual mailboxes. This can be done for a specified time period such as the previous day, week, or month. This report can then be scheduled and monitored to determine significant changes in the number of incidents generated from each mailbox. Â   Check the Size of Your Mailboxes: For customers who host their own mailboxes (that is, mailboxes not hosted by Oracle B2C Service), monitor the size of your mailboxes to identify a problem in retrieving mail. If the mailbox size continues to grow over an hour or two, it may be that the utility is not running or there is a problem in retrieving mail such as a problem with the mailbox configuration problem or access to the mailbox itself.

Creating standard responses for incidents and chat requests;Answer ID 483;How do I create standard responses for use when responding to incidents and chat requests?;['Answer ID 1048', 'Answer ID 1001', 'Answer ID 453', 'Answer ID 1434'];   Standard Text Messages, Standard Response Text Oracle B2C Service (OSvC),Ã‚Â All versions;"  Oracle B2C Service allows you to create standard text responses that your staff can use when responding to customers in incidents or chat sessions. These standard text responses can also Â be appended automatically to incidents if configured in a business rule. They are designed to cut down on typing repetitive responses or snippets of information that would not make an appropriate public answer. Â  To create standard text, use these steps:  Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Standard Text Click New from the top ribbon Enter all applicable fields   Name - display name of standard text message  Hotkey - shortcut agents can use to append message (i.e. F8+hotkey)  Type - check each box where you want the standard text message to be available  Value - the standard text message Â can be added in plain text or HTML Â   Visibility - check each interface where the message is to be used  * For more detailed descriptions of each field, refer to Â Add or Edit Standard Text.   Save and Close  Using a Standard Response: When responding to a customer via an incident response or chat session, Â click the Standard Text button in the tool bar. In the pop-up window, either drag the name of the standard text item to your response or right click on the standard text and select Add Standard Text. If you know the shortcut for the standard response, click F8 to open the shortcut box. Enter the hotkey (shortcut) sequence and press Enter to append the standard text message to your response. See Additional Resources section below for more ways to use standard text messages. HTML Value field: The content of the HTML Value field is when the rich text editor is enabled for incident entries (responses, private notes, customer entries). When the plain text editor is selected on an incident, then the standard text's ""Text"" value is used. Â  Â  When an end-user submits an incident and a business rule is in place to append the response template to the Solution field, if the response template has content in the HTML Value field, that HTML content displays to the end-user before the incident is actually submitted. This allows you to display suggested solutions using the $solutions variable before the incident is submitted. System Variables: When creating standard text responses, you can append system-defined variables into the standard text response. Click the $ icon on the right side of the Value bar.  In addition to including database fields in a standard text response, there are two special variables that can be included in the response:  $solutions -- The SmartAssistance ($solutions) variable lists SmartAssistant suggested solutions in the response to an incident. When the response is appended to an incident, the $solution variable is replaced by the specific answers suggested by SmartAssistant.   $response_link The Response Link ($response_link) variable adds a link to the response that takes the recipient to the login page and then to the page that allows them to update the incident from the Account Â section.  File Attachments: Â  It is not possible to include a file attachment as part of your standard text. However, you can include a link within your standard text to access a web-accessible file. Â  That is, you can host the file Â on your organization's web server and then include a hyperlink in the standard text content. Â  Be sure to use proper HTML code within the Text field so that the link is included when the standard text is appended to the incident thread and sent as part of a response. Delete Standard Text Message: Standard text messages can be deleted at any time by selecting the standard text entry in the tree and clicking the Delete button on the ribbon. However, when you delete standard text, all instances of the standard text will also be deleted. Grouping Standard Text Messages: You can group responses in folders that you configure. For more information on creating and using response folders, refer to Answer ID 1048: Grouping standard text responses in folders.

People not receiving scheduled reports;Answer ID 485;I am not receiving any reports subscribed to via email. What can I do to fix this?;['Answer ID 9505', 'Answer ID 2245'];   Scheduled Reports Oracle B2C Service;  If recipients are not receiving scheduled reports, verify the following features and configuration:  Verify the schedule is still set on the report. A schedule will be deleted if the Run report as option in the schedule is set to a staff account which has been deleted. Â If an account was not recently deleted, the rntaccess account may have been used for this option. This is a system-defined account Â used by Technical Support that is added and deleted frequently during troubleshooting. For this reason, the rntaccess account should not be used Â for this option in the schedule. For more information on the rntaccess account, refer to Answer ID 9505: RNTaccess account.  Â  Â  In the Staff Accounts table, verify that the correct email is listed in the staff record. Note: Â Only one email address should be configured in the staff account if the configuration setting RPT_FROM_ADDR is set to value 2. Â  Â If there are two email addresses, the report will not be sent.  Verify that there is a deafult service mailbox that is enabled for outbound.  Â  Verify that the report subscription includes the staff member's name, email address, or work group. Â   Â  For the report subscription, verify that the time frame you have requested is listed correctly. Â   Â  If you have subscribed to a custom report, ensure that the report has not been removed and that the name of the report has not been changed. Â   Â  Verify that your internal mail security for your organization is not rejecting or deleting the subscription notifications automatically. If the From Address on the Report-Subscription email has the same domain as the recipient's email address, the message may be interpreted as a possible spoof and therefore deleted.  To test this, edit the scheduled report and include an email that is outside of your domain, such as a home, personal email address. If you receive the subscription at the email address outside your company's domain, then you should edit the RPT_FROM_ADDR configuration setting to use the default mailbox setting. For more information on spoofed email addresses, refer to Answer ID 2245: Scheduled reports and forwarded incidents are getting blocked. Â   Â  Verify that reportgen-si is running for your application. To view the utility stats, click the Â My Site Tool from the Oracle Support Site, Â verify your credentials and then click Utility Stats under the Hosting Services section.

Regular expressions and how they apply to rules;Answer ID 486;What are regular expressions and how do they apply to rules?;['Answer ID 861'];   Regular Expressions used in Business Rules;"  A regular expression uses operators and character strings to Â specify a set of character strings, which can be used when configuring Â rules to allow more flexibility in the criteria used to route or escalate records. Note: When using regular expressions, an asterisk (*) does NOT represent a wildcard. Instead, the asterisk makes the preceding character optional. For more information on this, refer to Answer ID 861: Rules Matching Incorrectly. Additionally, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also important to understand the Ã¢â‚¬ËœRegular ExpressionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ operator evaluates the raw data/text that is input into the database except Incident threads. In case of Incident threads, HTML Markup will be considered too. Â  The table below provides some types of regular expressions that may be used with Â business rules. When working with regular expressions, the operator for the field you select must be either Matches Regular Expression or Does Not Match Regular Expression.  Pipe for OR conditions: The most common usage of regular expressions used with rules is the pipe ( | ). The pipe is used to specify a series of words or phrases that you are interested in matching. The pipe acts as an OR statement between each item separated by the pipe character. For example, to set up a criteria that matches the rule if the subject of an email contains ""help"" or ""assistance"", you can set up the criteria in the rule as listed below: Incident.Summary matches regular expression help|assistance You can then add additional criteria or specify actions to complete the configuration of your rule.  Case sensitivity: Â  Terms listed in regular expressions are not case sensitive, so if the rule is set to match the regular expression ABC, then the following expressions will match: Â  ABC, abc, abC, ABc. The expression [A-Z] with the brackets is a specific regular expression to check for uppercase characters in the expression.  Testing rules: Once your rule is configured, be sure to test the rule by creating or editing test records to your site. Create or edit at least one record that will match the rule to verify that Â the rules you Â configure Â act on the record as you expect. Also Â create or edit Â at least one Â record that should not match your rules to verify that the rule will not affect records that Â they shouldn't.   The following table lists some of the regular expression operators that work with business rules. Oracle RightNow CX accepts any regular expression using POSIX Extended Syntax.  Descriptions of Regular Expressions      [ ]   Â --  Matches any character in the brackets.     [0-9]   Â --  Matches Â any number between 0 and 9.     [A-Za-z]  --  Matches any Â character A-Z or a-z.     [^]  --  Matches any characters NOT in the brackets. The first character in the brackets must be ^.     text1|text2  --  The pipe characters act as Â a Boolean Â OR, that is, text1 OR text 2 results in a match.   Â   Note: Do not include a pipe at the beginning or end of your regular expression.     .  --  Matches any single character except a new line     ?  --  The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.     *  --  The preceding item is repeated as many times as necessary to match. Also matches if preceding item is not present.     +  --  The preceding item will be matched one or more times.     {n}  --  The preceding item is matched exactly n times.     {n,}  --  The preceding item is matched n or more times.     {,m}   Â --  The preceding item is optional and is matched at most m times.     {n,m}  --  The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times.     \w  --  Any alphanumeric character     ( )  --  Used to group elements of the regular expression, as in arithmetic.     ^  --  Match if at start of line     $  --  Match if at end of line     \   Â --  Quote or escape Â a character that would otherwise be interpreted as a syntactic character. Characters that must be quoted are: + ? | ( ) { }     Examples of Regular Expressions      This regular expression:      matches:     ^ABC  --  ABC Â at the beginning of a line     ABC$  --  ABC at the end of a line     ^ABC$  --  ABC Â as the only word on the line     ^...$  --  Any line with exactly three characters     ^......-.....1   Â --  Any Â reference number ending in '1'     t.e  --  tae, tbe, tce, t%e, tie, the, toe ....     at*e  --  ae, ate, atte, attte, atttte ...     at+e  --  ate, atte, attte ...     at?e  --  ae, ate     m[aeiou]t  --  mat, met, mit, mot, mut     cat|mat  --  cat, mat     lo{4}ng  --  loooong     lo{2,4}ng  --  loong, looong, loooong     ward | ward\. | ^ward  --  ""ward"" surrounded by spaces (this prevents ""forward"" or ""backward"" from matching), ""ward"" at the end of a sentence, and ""ward"" at the beginning of a line (no preceding space)."

Using staff groups;Answer ID 491;What are staff groups and why should we use them?;['Answer ID 1843', 'Answer ID 1004', 'Answer ID 1415'];  Staff Accounts, Incident Routing;" Groups are defined in the Staff Accounts table and allow you to more easily organize your staff accounts which allows you to report on specific groups of accounts. Each staff member must belong to a single group. It is not possible to have a staff member assigned to a primary staff group and also be assigned to a secondary staff group. Note: While it is possible to use incident rules to route incidents to a specific group, it is not possible to specify an automatic assignment policy for assigning how incidents are distributed to staff members within a group. You can use incident queues to define groups of incidents from which staff members can pull incidents into their Inbox. For more information on Queues, refer to Answer ID 1843: Routing incidents to staff members based on queues. To add a staff group, use the steps below: From the Configuration Menu, open the Staff Management folder. Open a corresponding report that will display staff accounts. i.e. 'Staff Accounts by Group', 'Staff Accounts by Profile', 'Accounts by Profile Permissions'. Open a staff account record and locate the 'Group' field and click on the magnifying glass. This opens the 'Account Groups' dialog window allowing you to make your edits. To add a new group, select New Group from the top right. Name the group and click OK In order to move a group, you must first ensure that all disabled staff accounts are visible. Right click in the white space in the left frame and select Show Disabled. Now, you can drag and drop the group to a different location in your overall list. You cannot delete a staff group if there is a staff member in the group. You must first either delete the staff members from the group or move staff members to another group. If you delete a group, any incidents assigned to that group will show ""undefined"" in the Assigned menu to indicate that the group is no longer defined within your application. For more information on the impact of deleting staff accounts and groups, refer to: Answer ID 1004: Effect on other tables when a staff account is deleted or moved Â  Answer ID 1415: Effects of deleting staff accounts in Oracle B2C Service."

Handling chat requests from multiple interfaces;Answer ID 497;Can a chat agent answer chat requests from multiple interfaces?;['Answer ID 1843', 'Answer ID 1004', 'Answer ID 1415'];   Oracle Service Chat, Chat Routing Oracle B2C Service;  The Â Oracle B2C Service Â application does offer the functionality to allow agents logged into one interface to accept chats coming from endusers on different interfaces. Â  Â This gives the agents the ability to service multiple Â interfaces. Â  Â  Â  The use of Â Oracle Service Chat allows multiple interfaces to integrate very easily. Â  Â Chat routing rules and chat queues become solely responsible for routing chats with Oracle Service Chat. Â  Â By default, an agent logged into chat will have the capability of accepting chats coming from multiple interfaces. Â  Â  Â By default all enduser chat requests, regardless of interface source, will be routed into the Chat Default Queue. Â  Â As long as the chat agents have profile permissions to accept chats from this queue, they will have the ability to accept chats from any interface. If you do wish to keep chats separated according to interface then the use of chat rules and chat queues will grant this functionality. Â  Â A chat queue will need to be created for each interface. Â  Â From the chat rules you can then separate the chats into the newly created chat queues according to their interface source. Â  Â The chat rule example shown below will route all chats coming from Interface A into Queue A. Chat Rule: If: Â  Â Incident.Interface = Interface A Then: Â  Â Assign Chat Queue = Queue A For more information on routing chats, refer to the online documentation for Chat for Agents, Supervisors, and Customers Â and Â Configuring Advanced Routing for Chat.

Session information in incidents;Answer ID 499;What is a customer session and how can I use session information?;['Answer ID 1843', 'Answer ID 1004', 'Answer ID 1415'];   Sessions, Incidents, AnalyticsÃ‚Â ;"  The customer session is a record of activity performed by an end-user prior to submitting an Ask a Question request or feedback to the site or Â published answer. The customer session includes which answers were viewed, the satisfaction rating given for an answer, the session length, and which searches were performed. Note: Incidents created from incoming email requests and incidents created by a staff member from the administrative pages do not include a customer session. By reviewing the Â session, an agent can review which information the end-user viewed prior to submitting a request. Reviewing the session can also give an indication of how reliant end-users are on submitting assistance requests as opposed to first checking the public answers. Session data Â is quite valuable when reviewing feedback from customers on a given answer. From the incident created from the feedback, the Â agent can view the session to see what the user reviewed and searched on. Based on this information, you may wish to edit or update specific answers so that they can be more easily found with specific keywords. Customer sessions are only accessible for unresolved incidents and for incidents that have been solved for less than 30 days. If the incident is older than 30 days AND IN A RESOLVED STATE, there is a good chance that the session information has been removed from the incident.  Accessing and viewing session data: Â  By default the session data displays on a Web Visit tab when editing an incident. Open the incident and click the Web Visit tab. Click the link to open the viewed answer in a separate page. Web Visit location within an incident is controlled by the incident workspace used by the staff member. As a result, the Web Visit feature may be located on a different tab or may have been removed from the workspace for some reason.

Customizing the Answer Display page;Answer ID 514;How can I customize the Answer Display page?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Customer Portal, Answer Display; The Answer Display page presents content for an individual answer published to your end-user pages. Initially, when a user clicks the Answers tab, a list of answers display. When the user clicks the summary link, they are taken to the answer display page. By default, several features are included on the answer display page, including the ability to email the answer link to someone else, Â print Â the answer or provide feedback. In Customer Portal, by default, the answers/detail.php Â file controls the content of the Answer Display page. Â  By default, the answers/detail.php file includes widgets for the following features. standard/Search/AdvancedSearchDialog: Â  This widget defines the Basic and Advanced search functionality. Â  The widget Â uses the filters from the designated report (default report_id=158) to include in the Advanced Search area.  Â  standard/utils/EmailAnswerLink: Â  This widget presents a link that, when Â clicked, allows the user to email a link to the current answer page after submitting the user's name and email address and the recipient's email address. Â   Â  standard/utils/PrintPageLink: Â  When clicked, this widget calls the browser's print dialog in order to print the current page. The site's CSS may need to be configured via the print media type to hide or show particular content for the printed page.  Â  Â  Â  standard/notifications/AnswerNotificationIcon: Â  This widget displays Â the Â Answer Â Notification feature on the page.  Â  standard/output/ProductCategoryDisplay: Â  This widget displays the value of the data source specified. The field must be a Hiermenu type, specifically products or categories. Displayable system fields are listed on the Business Objects page of the Tag Gallery.  Â  standard/output/CustomAllDisplay: Â  This widget displays all end-user custom fields with end-user visibility for the database table indicated.

Time zone used for the date/time stamp -- end-user's or agent's?;Answer ID 515;When an end-user requests assistance, which time zone is used for the date/time stamp in the incident or for the agent response?;['Answer ID 605'];   Time zone, Interfaces, All versions  Issue   When an end-user requests assistance, which time zone is used for the date / time stamp in the incident? Which time zone is used when the agent responds?Ã‚Â  Why would incident reference numbers be showing tomorrow's date?;"  The time zone used depends on how you have configured your application and how many interfaces you are using.  Using a Single Interface  If you have one interface, the time zone defined in the TZ_INTERFACE configuration setting (a hidden setting) is used for all time and date information, including the time stamp, the date created field and the date updated field, regardless of which time zone the end-user enters their request from. For example: If an end-user enters a request from New York and the TZ_INTERFACE setting is set to match the location of the company's home office in California, that is, the Pacific time zone, all time stamp entries will be in Pacific time -- even for entries from the end-user.  Using Multiple Interfaces  If you have multiple interfaces, each interface can be configured with a different time zone in the TZ_INTERFACE configuration settings. In this case, the time stamp that is included in incidents depends on which interface the end-user and the agent are using. For example: If an end-user enters an assistance request through an interface whose TZ_INTERFACE setting is set to East coast time (EST5EDT), all entries by that user will be in East coast time. If the agent responds to the request through an interface set to Mountain time, the agent's response will be in Mountain time (MST7MDT).  Incidents created with tomorrow's date  There are a couple things to consider when you see incidents created with tomorrow's date. Â  Check the setting TZ_INTERFACE. Â  Â This will show you the time zone that the interface is set to. Â  Â It may not be set to your local time zone. Â  All transactions such as private notes and responses within the database will be set per the TZ_INTERFACE setting. The incident reference number prefix will change to ""tomorrow's"" date as soon as the first incident has been received on an interface within a current time greater than midnight. Â  Â For example, if a site has two interfaces, one Â with a time zone equal to Australia/Sydney and the second interface is set to Â PST8PDT (American Pacific), the reference numbers for both interfaces will switch as soon as the first incident is submitted on the Australian interface. Â  Â In this scenario, an incident will be created on the PST8PDT interface with ""tomorrow's"" date several hours before midnight PST.  Note: For more information on configuring time zones, refer to Answer ID 605: Setting the time zone in Oracle B2C Service."

Creating custom fields to be used with chat sessions;Answer ID 522;How can I configureÃ‚Â Chat to include custom fields to be filled out when requesting aÃ‚Â live chat session?;['Answer ID 1131', 'Answer ID 7878'];  Custom Fields for Chat; You can configure Â Oracle B2C Service Â to request specific custom chat fields before a chat session is started. The chat fields are actually incident custom fields that are enabled specifically to be visible on the end-user pages for requesting a chat or phone callback. When Chat is enabled you can configure incident custom fields to display when a chat session is requested from the Â Chat Help page. Additional check boxes display in the Visibility section that allows the field to display for use with Chat. Therefore, with Â Chat enabled, to create a custom field for use with Chat, create or edit a custom incident field. Look in the Visibility section and you will find two additional check boxes for Â Chat. Enable the appropriate check box as with other custom fields, you can also enable the 'Required' check box to make the field required when your customer requests a chat session.

Making a product or category specific to one interface;Answer ID 524;How do I make a product or category specific to one interface? We have certain products that should not be viewed from other interfaces.;['Answer ID 5168'];   Products/Categories/Dispositions, Incidents and Answers Relating to sites with multiple interfaces;"  If you have only one product or sub-product visible for an interface, then there are no selection options, so the Product menu is not displayed on the end-user pages even if the report used Â for the end-user page Â Search page is configured to display the menu. In order for the menu to display, there must be at least two products or sub-products visible to the end-user pages. This works similarly for the Categories menu as well. In Oracle B2C Service, when you add or edit a product or category, you can specify which interfaces will include the specific value in the Product or Category drop-down menu on the end-user pages. When configuring products and categories, the Visibility section of the page, includes checkboxes for Administration and End-User visibility. Administration visibility: Â  With multiple interfaces, the functionality Â associated with the Administration visibility settings behave differently for incidents and answers. For incidents, if the Administration box is enabled for an interface, that value is listed in the Products or Categories menu when a staff member edits an incident from the administration console. Â  If the End-User visibility box is also checked, that value displays on the Ask a Question page when end-users submit incidents. For answers, all products listed in the Products table display for all interfaces Â  when editing an answer, regardless of the Admin visibility configuration. Â  This allows knowledge engineers to use a single interface for editing and publishing answers.  For example, Â your site Â may have Â three interfaces and product A has Admin visibility enabled for the Â second interface but not for the other two interfaces. Â  (Product A may also have Â End-User visibility enabled for the second interface.) Â  When editing incidents, staff only see Product A listed if they are editing incidents from the second interface. Â  Staff using the first or third interfaces do not see Product A in the product list when editing incidents. When editing answers, though, Â product A displays when editing answers from any of the three interfaces -- even though the admin visibility is enabled only for one interface. Â  With this functionality, your knowledge engineers can open and edit Â the answer from any interface. Then, they can set the products and category values so that the answer will be published to your second interface.  To include or exclude products or categories from an interface, use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select Service &gt; Products/Categories/Dispositions.   Right click on the product or category name and select Edit.   In the Visibility section on the update page, use the check boxes to enable the product or category for each interface. You can include the product or category on the administration pages and/or the end-user pages.   Click Update.   Verify the configuration for your interfaces.

SmartSense and emotive indexing;Answer ID 528;What is emotive indexing or SmartSense?;['Answer ID 5168'];   SmartSense Emotive Rating;"  The emotive indexing feature (SmartSense) determines the emotion or attitude of the person submitting an email or assistance request. It also evaluates the emotional tone of the staff member who responds to the incident. As a question is submitted by a site visitor, SmartSense scans the incoming text and assigns an emotive index to the incident. The index can be displayed with the incident so that the agent can review the contact's emotive tone as well. You can create workflow and escalation rules based on the emotive index. This allows the agent or support group to escalate incidents that they feel need immediate attention for customers who are highly dissatisfied with a product or service. Only response threads are considered for the staff SmartSense rating in incidents. Note threads are not evaluated. Additionally, SmartSense processes only the first 4,000 words in each incident thread rather than the entire thread, helping to make emotive indexing process faster for incident threads with a large number of words. You can also use SmartSense ratings in surveys and cloud monitoring. In surveys, responses to text questions, including SmartSense evaluations of each response, appear on the Results tab of the survey. The standard report used is named 'Topic Monitoring' (report id 7022). Smart Sense does not need to be enabled. Â There are two fields you are able to insert into the workspace itself. The two SmartSense fields are the Contact SmartSense and the Â Staff SmartSense. The SmartSense indicator searches for emotive words in the text of the responses (for Â Staff rating) and customer entries (for Contact rating) in the incident thread. Text in private notes will not affect either SmartSense rating. To add it to the appropriate workspace, just take the following steps: 1. Navigate to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces 2. Locate the workspace(s) you'd like to add the Smart Sense indicator to, open it for editing 3. Click on the ""Insert Field"" tab 4. Locate the ""Contact SmartSense"" and/or ""Staff SmartSense"" Â icon 5. Click and drag the icon to add it to the workspace 6. Save the workspace  For additional information on this feature, refer to the 'SmartSense Emotive Rating' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently on.

Restricting staff members from full administrative access;Answer ID 531;How do I restrict staff members from full administrative access on the administration pages?;['Answer ID 4352'];  Staff Account, Profiles, Permissions;" You can define specific profiles for your staff members. These profiles define the amount of access your staff members have to the various components of Oracle B2C Service. First, you must define the profile to be used by the staff member. Then, you can edit the staff member's account to assign that profile to the staff member. When creating a new profile, it is possible to create profiles that allow access to features that you may not have access to. However, when creating staff accounts, you can only assign profiles with features that you yourself have access to. For example, if you cannot access add and edit answers, you cannot assign profiles that allow staff to add and edit answers. Disabling staff from logging in: Â To disable a staff member from being able to log in to the administration side, check the Account Locked check box in their staff account.  Step 1: Create a New Profile  From the Configuration items, select Staff Management &gt; Profiles. Â  On the ribbon, Â click Â the New button. Enter the name of the profile. Enable the appropriate settings for Interfaces, Permissions and Analytics (All are buttons on the ribbon). Â  Click Save. Note: For more information on setting up a profile, refer to Answer ID 4352: Adding a Staff Profile in May 10 and later  Step 2: Assign the Profile to the Staff Member's Account  From the Configuration Items, Select Staff Management &gt; Staff Accounts by Group.

Note: When you add a staff account, you associate a profile and navigation set with the staff member. Those items will need to be created prior to creating the staff account.  When adding or editing a staff account, you define the login information and can also define a name for the staff member to display in Chat and a signature for responding to incidents. The Staff Accounts editor is also where you enter the default country and currency.  To create a new account:   From the Configuration items, select Staff Management &gt; Staff Accounts by Profile (Staff Accounts by Manager and Staff Accounts by Group, also available) Select New from the Home ribbon options Complete all fields and Save  Each field in the account editor is defined in Â the Add or edit a staff account Â section of online documentation. Many are also outlined below:  Note: If Â Opportunities is enabled, three additional fields are listed when adding a staff account: Default Country, Default Currency, and Territory.   User Name The user name specifies a unique identifier for the account used during login.  First and Last Names: The first and last names are used when an incident is viewed from the administration pages.  Password: This is the login password of the staff member. The password is encrypted on this page.  Display Name: The display name is used in communication that is sent or displayed to an end-user via an incident response or a live chat. This allows you to identify agents in generic terms to the end-user, such as Customer Service Agent. From the administration pages, other staff members will see the first and last name fields (Sally Johnson) in the incident thread and the Assign To drop-down menus.  Profile: Specifies the profile the account belongs to. Profiles are used to associate navigation sets and define permissions.  Group: Specifies the group the account belongs to. Groups are used to categorize accounts in assignment menus.  Time Zone: This specifies the time zone to be used for staff members who may be working from different time zones. This allows staff members to view the correct time for their location. If you select SAME AS INTERFACE, the time zone will be the value of the TZ_INTERFACE configuration setting. This setting does NOT display if the staff profile has any of the following privileges enabled: Administration Settings, Incidents Add/Update, Incidents Send Response, Incidents Delete, or Edit SLA Instances. In this case, the value of the TZ_INTERFACE setting is used. In the continental United States, time zone options are: EST5EDT -- Eastern time zone CST6CDT -- Central time zone MST7MDT -- Mountain time zone PST8PDT -- Pacific time zone  For more information on formats used, refer to Answer 605: Setting the time zone in Oracle B2C Service.  Default Currency: The default currency specifies which currency you wish to associate the account with.  Default Country: The default country specifies which country is preselected on the Contact tab when a new incident or contact record is created on the Support Console.  E-mail Address: This is the e-mail address for the staff member. Management reports and email notifications, if enabled, are sent to this address for the staff member. If this field is left blank, the staff member will not receive any email communication from Oracle B2C Service.

Using special characters in a search in Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 541;How does Oracle B2C Service index words that contain underscores or hyphens?;['Answer ID 1660'];   Answer Phrase Searching;"  Determining How Â Oracle B2C Service Indexes Â Strings with Â Special Characters:  Oracle B2C Service Â indexes complex strings differently depending on the nature of the string itself. Â  With such a wide variety of combinations of alphabetic, numeric, and special characters in a string, it is best to test how the application indexes your specific string so that you can determine how your site visitors can search on the string of interest, such as a part number, Â business code, or document number. Note: If you are working with an answer that is not yet published, you can Â search your answers from the administrative side using the same search options that are allowed on your end-user pages. Set up a view or report that includes the same search options as your end-user pages. Â This allows you to replicate the search behavior that your end-users experience when you publish the answer.  To determine how the string is indexed: Â  When a complex string is indexed, Â Oracle B2C Service indexes either the entire string or it will index each component of the string separately. For example, abc_def is indexed as a whole, but abc(def) is indexed as ""abc"" and ""def"". Therefore, to determine how the string gets indexed, use the following approach:  Step 1: Search for the answer using a component of the overall string, that is, the content before or after the special character. In the case, of 123.abc, search on Â either ""123"" or ""abc"". Â   If the answer is returned, then Â the components Â are indexed separately. Â  End-users will be able to search on ""abc"", ""123"" or ""abc.123"" and they will get the answer in the search results.  Note: If each component is indexed separately, end-users will typically get more answers than expected, especially if your site uses OR searching. Searching on ""abc"" returns the answer of interest but also returns answers with ""abc"", ""abc.456"", and ""abc.789"" as well.  Â    Step 2: If the answer is not returned from the search done in step 1, the entire string is likely indexed. Â   Â  Search on the entire string and your answer should be returned. Consider adding Â parts of the overall string as keywords or aliases if you feel your end-users will search on the substrings.  Indexing parts of Â the Â overall string: You can add each individual component to the Keywords field for the answer. So, in cases where searching on ""abc"" should return Â answers that contain ""abc_def"", you can include ""abc"" in the Keywords field of the answer. You can use the aliases.txt file to define aliases for components that you search on. For example, you could add Â the following Â line to the aliases.txt file to allow the user to search on ""abc"" to return answers with ""abc_def"" and ""abc123"": ABC,ABC_DEF,ABC123  With this line added to the aliases file, when a user searches on ""abc"", answers that have ""abc_def"" or ""abc123"" are returned in the results. For more information on keywords and aliases, refer to Answer ID 1660: Adding Synonyms for Searching.  Words that begin or end with a special character  When a word that begins or ends with a special character is indexed into the phrases table of the database (from which all searches find keywords), all punctuation characters are removed from the word. As a result, when ""~tabletop"" or ""tabletop~"" is indexed, it is entered as ""tabletop"". When a phrase (or similar phrase) search is performed on ""~tabletop~"", the search ignores the leading and trailing characters and searches on ""tabletop"", which will find all incidents with ""tabletop"" in them. This search will pull up more answers than you are searching for since it removes any initial special characters.  Words with Special Characters in the Middle of the Word  With the exception of periods, when a special character Â (such as a dash or underscore) is within an alphanumeric string, the Â entire string Â is typically indexed to include the special character and word stemming is applied to the end of the word. For strings that include parentheses and brackets, in general, each component is indexed and the entire string is not indexed. In other words, parentheses and brackets make no difference. Important! The search functionality on your site may work differently due to the addition of keywords to individual answers or due to aliasing that may be configured for your specific application. In addition, specific combinations and Â special characters Â may behave differently. Be sure to use the approach above to determine how your specific string is indexed. The most common characters are provided below with specific descriptions:        Alphanumeric: (abc123, for example). Single letters, such as A or b, are not indexed and are not searchable. For alphanumeric combinations, the whole sequence is indexed. If the sequence ends in a letter, the sequence is subject to word stemming. Numbers within the sequence are not indexed separately. Searching on ""abc"" or ""123"" does not return the answer. Searching on ""abc123"" does return the answer. Â  Â    Â            Numeric: ( 7 or 123, for example). All numbers except for zero (0) are indexed, such as 123. Searching on ""7"" or ""123"" returns all answers with that numerical value. Searching on ""0"" is considered a null search so all answers are returned.    In cases of measurements, such as "" (inches) or ' (feet), the double or single quotes are not indexed, so 14"" is indexed as 14 and 32' is indexed as 32. Â    Â            Periods within words: How the string and the components are indexed depend on how the string is entered.    For example: rightnow.com. If the letters are all lowercase, then both parts of the word are indexed separately. So, in this case, searching on ""rightnow"" or on ""com"" would return the answer. Searching on ""rightnow.com"" also returns the answer.    If any letter is capitalized, then ONLY the entire string is indexed and the search is case-sensitive. This allows you to enter specific file names in all uppercase letters so that the entire file name is indexed. As a result, ""RIGHTNOW.COM"" and ""RightNow.com"" are indexed differently from one another and the search is case-sensitive. Searching on ""rightnow"" will not return RIGHTNOW.COM or RightNow.com. Searching on ""RIGHTNOW.COM"" does not return the answer with RightNow.com in it. Â    Â              Dash or hyphen: Example: Â abc-123. Â The components before and after the hyphen are Â indexed separately because the dash is treated as a space.  Â This applies only to alpha-numeric Â phrases. Â  All alphabetic phrases (i.e. meta-answers), the whole string is indexed and word stemming is applied. Â  Â However, when there is a space before a dash, it acts as an exclude function. For example, if you Â search on Â ""meta -answers"" it will return only answers with ""meta"" in them, but not ""answers"".   In February 2010 and later releases, the trailing word has to start with a letter to be kept with the previous word and the first word needs to start with a letter as well.   Â  Â          Underscore: (abc_def, for example) The whole word is indexed and word stemming is applied. The components before and after the underscore are not indexed separately. Searching on ""abc"" or ""def"" will not return the answer. Searching on ""abc_def"" will return the answer. Â    Â            Parentheses and Brackets: Including ( ), [ ], and { }. Example: abc(def) or ab[c]de. The parentheses or brackets act like a space and break the string into separate components that are indexed separately.    In the case of abc(def) or abc[def], searching on ""abc"" and ""def"" will return the answer. Searching on abc(def) will perform the same search as ""abc def"". If OR searching is enabled for the end-user search, then answers with ""abc"" or ""def"" are returned.    Single letters are not indexed so if one component is a single letter, that component is not searchable. In the case of ab{c}de, searching on ""ab"" or ""de"" returns the answer, but searching on the single letter ""c"" does not return the answer. Â    Â              HTML Brackets &lt; and &gt;: Words and components within HTML brackets &lt; and &gt; are not indexed. So in the case of abc&lt;def&gt;, the ""abc"" component is indexed, but the ""def"" component is not.              Slash: The search will separate the words on the / like the . mentioned in the answer above for Periods. The slash only separates the words and doesn't follow any of the special handling that the period does with capital letters."

Actions a business rule can execute;Answer ID 551;What actions can a business rule execute?;['Answer ID 5965', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Business Rules;"  The specific actions that can be included in a rule depend on what version you are using and which types of rules you are configuring. The actions available for incident rules are different from contact or organization rules, for example. In general, you can use rules to set system and custom fields and escalate records. With answers, incidents, and opportunities, you can use rules to automatically assign records to specific staff members. Note: Depending on specific configuration of your site, some actions may not appear in your list of actions on your site. For example, if you do not have categories defined in the Categories table, the Set Field &gt; Category action does not display as an available action.  Actions for Â Incident Rules: The items listed below are actions that can be configured within incident Â rules.        Set Field: This action will set or change the selected field for an incident. Example fields include, Assigned, Status, Product, Category, etc. Â  Â  Â    Â  Â        Set Custom Field: This action sets the custom field to the value specified. This appears only if you have at least one incident, customer, or company custom field configured.           Set Variable: This action will set the variable to an absolute value, increment or decrement the variable, or append or prepend a character string. Â  Â               Â  Â              Append Thread: Â            Append Response Template to Â Response Field (or Notes field): This action appends a pre-written response to the Response field of the incident. The response template can be edited through the Standard Responses table. This appears only if you have at least one standard response (enabled as a workflow response) configured in the Standard Responses table.           Append Existing Solution (by Answer ID) to Response Field: This action appends and displays a published answer to the Solution field of the incident.           Append SmartAssistant Response to Response Field: This action displays a list of links which SmartAssistant suggests to the end-user submitting the incident. The links are also appended to the Solution field if the end-user finishes submitted the request.           Append Response to the Uncommitted Response Buffer: Use this action to automatically append a response template or answer to the incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proposed response field. This action is used in conjunction with the other Append Thread actions that append an answer or response template. If you want the item appended to the incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saved thread, do not add the Append Response to the Uncommitted Response Buffer action to the rule.                            Email:         Send Email Response to Sender: This action sends an e-mail to the sender containing the incident summary and response. To also include the question and/or incident details in the email, select the appropriate check box(es).    Note: You should not add this action unless you have appended a response to the incident. Refer to actions above associated with Append in this table. Using this action without appending something to the Response field results in no email being sent to the customer.           E-mail Incident Information: Sends a copy of the Question Receipt email message to the address you type in the field or select from a menu. You can also send the information to the staff person assigned to the incident. To include administration fields and customer fields, select the appropriate check boxes. Administration fields must be selected before you can select customer fields. Administration fields include the reference number, subject, date created, date last updated, status, assigned staff member, and the incident thread, including private notes. Customer information includes the contactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s email address, first and last names, contact type, title, office phone number, organization, and any contact and organization custom field data.    Note: The ""including administration fields"" and ""including customer fields"" options do not apply to Message Templates. They only applied to the now deprecated Mail Scripts.           Send Escalation Notification: Sends an escalation notification to the staff member or Â group you specify. You can also select a check box to send the escalation notice to the staff person assigned to the incident.  Note: If multiple recipients are selected, press Ctrl and click a recipient to add it to (or clear it from) the list of selected recipients.           Send Marketing Email: Sends the mailing you select from the drop-down menu to the contact for the incident. The default time for sending the mailing is 0 hours, but you can specify the number of minutes, hours, or days after rules processing ends that you want to send the mailing.  Note: This option does not appear if Outreach is not enabled and if no mailings have been created.           Send Transactional Survey: Sends the transactional survey you select from the drop-down menu to the contact for the incident. The default time for sending the survey is 0 hours, but you can specify the number of minutes, hours, or days after rules processing ends that you want to send the survey. The survey will only be sent to the contact once per incident regardless of how many times the rule is matched.  Note: At least one transactional survey must have been added and enabled for ""Rule Visibility"" Â in order for this option to appear. Only transactional surveys can be sent in a rule.           Send Receipt Email: Sends a receipt email to the contact associated with an incident.                        Additional Actions:           Execute Object Event Handler: Â Select this action to trigger an external event and then select the type of object event handler from the drop-down menu.  Note: For objects to display in the Execute Object Event Handler drop-down menu, they must be added on the process designer and then the process model must be deployed.           Do Not Create Incident: Â Select this action to prevent an incident from being added.  Note: When an incident is being updated, this action has no effect.           Do Not Send Email Receipt Message: Select this action to prevent the normal transmission of the email receipt message to the sender. If the incident meets the rule conditions, an automatic response is not sent to the customer.           Do Not Send Response: Â Select this action to prevent an automatic response from being sent when an incident is updated. For example, if your responses are delivered through a message system outside of Oracle B2C Service, you can use this rule to suppress an automatic response.  Note: To ensure all responses are suppressed, this rule must be executed last.           Assign Incident to Staff Member Assigned the Answer: Â Select this action to assign the incident to the same staff member who is assigned the answer.  Note: This action has meaning only when the incident source is End-User Pages &gt; Feedback on Answers. A rule with this action fires only when an incident is created, not when it is subsequently edited.           Escalate: Select this action to escalate the incident to the level you select and set other escalation settings.           Clear Escalation: Select this action to clear the escalation level.       For additional information, refer to the 'Actions for Rule Bases' section in online documentation and select the rulebase type you wish to modify.

Emailing passwords to end-users;Answer ID 552;Why can't our end-users have their passwords emailed to them?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Contacts, Mailboxes Oracle B2C Service;"  The Email Me My Password feature on the end-user pages requires a Reply-To address to be set within the default mailbox that is configured for your site. If your default mailbox does not have a Reply-To Address defined, the end-user's password cannot be sent from Oracle B2C Service. To check the configuration of your mailbox(es), use the steps below:  From the Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes &gt; Service Mailboxes Right click on the mailbox name and select Edit. Input a Â Reply-To Address field. If blank, copy the value from the E-mail Address field and click Save.  Once the default mailbox has been configured with a reply-to address, go to your Login page on the end-user interface and test the Email Password feature. Note: This feature will send for existing contacts only; where the customer had already accessed the end-user pages and had an account.  For additional information, refer to the 'How Mailboxes Work' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Search By options on end-user pages;Answer ID 566;What kind of searches are performed when a specific option is selected on the Answers Search page?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Enduser Page, Phrase Searching;" The end-user page view allows four different types of searching to be performed when finding publicly-displayed answers. The default options are: phrases, similar phrases, exact phrase, and complex expression. The table below provides descriptions and examples for each type. In addition, click the Search Tips link above the Search Text (optional) box to view this same information. The menu options listed in the Â Search Â field Â are run-time selectable filters configured for the Â report used for the End-user Answers List Â page. The search types correspond Â to the following database fields from the answers table:  Search Type Database Field   Â Phrases  Â answers.search_nl   Â Similar Phrases  Â answers.search_fnl   Â Exact Phrase  Â answers.search_ex   Â Complex Expression  Â answers.search.cpx   Note: In the Customer Portal page set, the Search Type field is defined by the standard/search/SearchTypeList or SearchTypeList2 widget. This widget defines options listed in the Search Type field when using an answer or incident report. The options in the menu correspond to runtime filters in the report. For answers, the search_nl, search_fnl, search_cpx, and search_ex filters are used to display the Phrases, Similar Phrases, Complex Expression and Exact Search options. For incidents, the search_thread and ref_no filters display as Summary/Thread and Reference # in the menu. If 'search_type_only' is set to false, all runtime filters of type integer (INT) or text (VARCHAR) are also included in the Search Type menu, including both standard and custom fields. Indexing Words and Phrases: When a word is placed into the phrases table of the database (from which all searches find keywords), all punctuation characters are removed from the word and the word is indexed in all uppercase letters. As a result, when ""~tabletop"" is placed into the phrases table, it is entered as ""TABLETOP"". Searching is therefore not sensitive to upper and lowercase characters. When a phrase (or similar phrase) search is performed on ~tabletop, the search ignores the leading character and searches on tabletop, which will find all incidents with tabletop in them. This search often results in more answers than you are searching for since it removes any special characters. All search techniques involve word stemming. When a search is performed each word in the phrase is stemmed to its root form and the search is performed on the root forms of each word. As a result, answers with different word forms, such as plural and singular nouns and different verb tenses, are included in the search results. For example, if you search for the word reflect, answers that contain the words reflection, reflections, reflected, reflecting or reflects are returned in the search results. Note: The maximum length of a keyword is 25 characters. Any word longer than 25 characters will be excluded as a keyword, and is therefore not searchable. Default Search Options: Â    Phrases: Type a short phrase or question describing what you want to know using natural language. Be sure to separate words with spaces and to include relevant information. You may use the require word (+) or exclude word (-) functions described below. Example: To ask the question, How can I learn more about wildfires, type either that exact sentence or wildfires, in the text box and click Search.  Â   Similar Phrases: Use this technique if you do not know the exact spelling or meaning of a word or phrase to check for similarly spelled words or synonyms. Use require (+) or exclude (-) word functions described below. Example: To search for What do I do when my hous is on fyre, type the exact sentence or hous fyre to find similar words or phrases such as house and abode, flame and fire.  Â   Exact Phrase: Use this technique to find question/answer pairs that match the same pattern of words contained in the text box. Example: To search question/answer pairs that contain Snake River, type the exact words, Snake River, in the text box.  Â   Complex Expression: Use this technique for wild card searching (*). Search for patterns if you know how they start, but not how they end. The asterisk covers all possible extensions. Example: To search question/answer pairs for occurrences of lodgepole pine, type lodge* in the text box.  Â    General Search Tips Â  In addition, some general searching tips are listed below:   To Require Words: Use the plus (+) symbol in front of words or phrases to find question/answer pairs that contain those words or phrases. Example: Search for +wildlife +bear to find documents that must contain both words, wildlife and bear.  Â    To Exclude Words: Use the minus (-) symbol in front of words to exclude question/answer pairs that contain those words. Example: Search for +wildlife -moose to find documents that contain the word wildlife but not the word moose.  Â    Use Root Words: Enter the root of the word to search for different tenses of the word including singular, plural, past, present or future. Example: Search for reflect to find answers that contain the words reflection, reflections, reflected, reflecting, or reflects.  Â    Use Rare Words: The more unusual your words are, the more specific your results will be. Always enter the rare word first. Â  "

Using the Service Summary report;Answer ID 569;What does the Service Summary report include?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Standard Reports;"  The Service Summary report provides information about the incidents submitted during the time period specified by the source of the incidents (Ask A Question requests or questions submitted through email). This report also displays a self-service summary providing statistics about the number of searches performed and the number of answers viewed. The Service Summary report consists of three graphs: Site Activity, Service Summary, and Self-Help Summary as well as a table of data that summarizes the numbers displayed in the graphs. You can find the Service Summary report by taking the following steps: 1. From the Analytics items, select Reports Explorer 2. From the Reports tree on the left follow the path Public Reports &gt; Service &gt; Site Reports &gt; Service Summary 3. You can also search on the report ID. The Â Report ID is 36 When generating a report, you must specify the date range of the report, which interface(s) you wish to include, and the time units (i.e. days, weeks, months) to display for each bar.  The Site Activity graph includes the number of page hits and the number of customer sessions. The number of hits represents the number of pages viewed on the end-user pages of Oracle B2C Service Â (Service). Pages accessed using the Back button are not included in the reported value.   The Service Summary graph displays information about incidents created during a specified time period and the source of those incidents, that is, Ask a Question requests or e-mail. Â    The Self-Help Summary includes counts of the number of Searches performed and the number of times answers were viewed for the same time period. The Answers Viewed is the number of times your site visitors viewed a display page.  For example, if you have 50 answers on your site and your end-users view them 250 times over the week, the number reported is 250 for the week. In this way, staff members get an indication of how many incidents enter the system compared to how much the end-users are utilizing the Oracle B2C Service (Service) self-help features.  The columns in the data table correspond to the values displayed in the three graphs. The components presented in the report are listed below:        Searches: Lists the number of searches performed on the end-user pages on each date. A search is counted each time an end-user clicks the Search button on the end-user pages.           Guides: Lists the number of times a guided assistance guide was accessed on the end-user pages on each date.           Answers Viewed: Lists the number of answers viewed on each date. This is the number of times an end-user has viewed the Answer Details page.           Visits: The number of Customer Portal Â visits for the time unit specified. A Â visit is use of the end-user pages. Â            Visitor Actions: Lists the number of actions done by the visitor on the end-user pages on each date. An action is counted every time the visitor clicks a button to perform an action - for example, a page turn or selecting the Search button.           Web Questions: Lists the number of incidents submitted through the Ask a Question page on each date.           Email Assists: Lists the number of incidents that have been submitted through email on each date. This number does not include XML emails that created incidents through the application program interface (API), or emails that are deleted by Â the utility techmail."

Disabling a staff account;Answer ID 570;How can I temporarily remove or disable a staff member from being assigned incidents and accessing the administration pages?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Staff Accounts Oracle B2C Service, All supported versions;"  You can either permanently disable a staff account or temporarily disable the account. Â  Several features in the staff account affect how a staff account can be disabled. Note: Â Any staff accounts marked as Disabled from Assignment, Disabled from Assignment/Report Filters, Â or Permanently Disabled, will not count towards your licensed users. You will be billed for the staff accounts that were enabled at the peak count of a service month. Also, any staff accounts that are locked by the administrator will not be counted. However, it is still Â recommended to move disabled accounts out of chat-enabled profiles. This will ensure chat seats are not consumed by a disabled agent account.  Description of Disabled Options  When disabling a staff account, you have several features that can be enabled or disabled, depending on your specific business processes: Not Disabled: Select this option to make the account available for assignment to incidents and other types of records and to display the account in report filters. This is the default option. Disabled from Assignment: Select this option to exclude the account from being assigned to incidents and other types of records. Even with the Disabled from Â Assignment selected, incidents or answers CAN be assigned directly to a staff member by a business rule. That is, if you have a business rule that assigns specific incidents directly to the staff member, if you Â select Disabled from Â Assignment box, the rule will still assign incidents directly to that staff member. Instead, in this case, you need to edit the rule and activate the ruleset. If you use a rule to assign incidents to a queue and that queue is set to distribute incidents via round robin to staff members whose profile includes the queue, the round robin assignment only includes staff members who can be assigned incidents. That is, if the staff member is disabled (by having the Assignment box checked), that staff member will not receive incidents via the round robin assignment.  Disabled from Assignment/Report Filters: Â  Select this option to exclude the account from being assigned to incidents and other types of records and from appearing in report filters. You cannot disable a staff account for the views and reports option if the account is used in business rules. If you try to disable the Views/Reports option when that account is used in a rule, when you click Update, a pop-up window indicates which rules include actions associated with that staff member. If necessary, modify the associated rules to remove the staff member and then edit the staff account again to disable from the views and reports. Any report schedules that are set to run from the account will automatically Â be updated to run from the Administrator account instead.  Permanently Disabled: Select this option to permanently disable the account. Accounts that are permanently disabled display in the reports but can not be re-enabled. You cannot disable a staff account for the views and reports option if the account is used in business rules. If you try to disable the Views/Reports option when that account is used in a rule, when you click Update, a pop-up window indicates which rules include actions associated with that staff member. If necessary, modify the associated rules to remove the staff member and then edit the staff account again to disable from the views and reports. Any report schedules that are set to run from the account will automatically Â be updated to run from the Administrator account instead. Note: Beginning in November 2014, the login/username for a permanently disabled account cannot be reused for a new account login/username.  Account Locked: Select this check box to temporarily lock the staff account. You might choose to do this if, for example, a staff member takes a leave of absence. This check box will also be selected automatically if a staff member has exceeded the number of invalid logins or has an expired password. Clear the check box to unlock the staff account. Important! When temporarily disabling accounts, only the Account Locked option prevents the staff member from logging in to the administration pages. Staff accounts that are disabled from assignment or views and reports CAN still log in. If the account is permanently disabled, the staff member can no longer log in to the administration pages and the account cannot be re-enabled at a later time.   To temporarily disable or to re-enable a staff member, use the steps below:  From the Â Configuration items, select Staff Management &gt; Staff Accounts by Groups. Â  If the account has already been temporarily disabled, it will display in Italic text. Right-click on the account name and select Â Open. In the Account Details, modify the Disabled Section accordingly. Click Save.  Note: By default, the standard Accounts reports (Accounts by Group, Accounts by Manager, and Accounts by Profile) display only active accounts and accounts that have been temporarily disabled. Accounts that have been permanently disabled are not displayed. To change the accounts displayed, click the Search button on the ribbon and select the accounts you want to view. When displayed on the report, temporarily disabled accounts are shown in italic text and permanently disabled accounts are displayed in gray text. For additional information, refer to the 'Add or edit staff accounts' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Changing the text on the tabs and the Support Home page;Answer ID 571;Can I change the text on the tabs of our end-user pages orÃ‚Â the headings on the Support Home page?;['Answer ID 383'];   Customer Portal (CP);"  You can edit the text of the tabs used to navigate through the end-user pages. By editing appropriate message bases, you can customize your end-pages to meet your specific needs. Note: For more information on editing message bases, refer to Answer ID 383: Determining Which Message Base to Edit. In the default Customer Portal files, the .php files include references to message bases so that staff can edit the text displayed on the page by editing the message bases instead of editing the .php file directly. Navigation buttons: Â  The navigation buttons are defined in two templates Â (rn_standard.php and rn_standard_account.php) using the NavigationTab widget. Within the widget, the label attribute calls out a specific RightNow message base. For the Support Home tab, the widget refers to the SUPPORT_HOME_TAB_HDG message base:  &lt;rn:widget path=""standard/navigation/NavigationTab"" label=""#rn:msg:SUPPORT_HOME_TAB_HDG#"" link=""/app/home"" pages=""home, "" css_class=""selected""/&gt;  To edit the Support Home label in the navigation button, you can edit the message base or you can edit the template and replace the reference to the message base with the specific text to display. By default, the message bases below are used for the navigation buttons in the templates:  SUPPORT_HOME_TAB_HDG ANSWERS_HDG ASK_QUESTION_HDG MY_STUFF_HDG  Content on Support Home Page: Â  By default, the home.php file defines the content of the Support Home page. The home.php file includes many references to RightNow message bases so that staff can modify the message base without having to edit the home.php file itself. For example, the Most Popular Answers section begins with references to two message bases: &lt;h2&gt;#rn:msg:MOST_POPULAR_ANSWERS_LBL#&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;#rn:msg:CLICK_VIEW_POPULAR_ANSWERS_LBL#&lt;/p&gt;  To determine which message base to edit, open the message base editor using the path: Common Configuration &gt; System Configuration &gt; Message Bases &gt; RightNow. Â  Then, enter a word or phrase from the text string on the Support Home page and search for message bases that contain that word or phrase."

Changing the text of the Products and Categories menus;Answer ID 573;How do I change the labels of the Products and Categories drop-down menus?;['Answer ID 1776', 'Answer ID 383'];"  Service &gt; Products/Categories/Dispositions";"  Edit Â content in administration pages: Â  To modify the Product and Category labels used on the administration pages including when editing incidents, you can edit the workspace where the product or category field displays. When editing the workspace, click the product or category field and Â then edit the Label Text property. To include a hotkey for the text, include an ampersand (&amp;) immediately prior to the hotkey. For example, if you change the text to be ""Issues"" with the ""I"" as the hotkey, enter ""&amp;Issues"" in the Label Text property.  Edit content on end-user pages: Â  To modify the Product and Category labels used on the end-user pages, edit the appropriate message bases. Use caution when editing message bases since message bases are frequently used in multiple locations of your interface. Â  That is, editing a message base affects all areas where that message base is used in the interface. The message bases below are typically of greatest interest to affect the text used on the end-user pages. SEARCH_BY_PRODUCT_CMD PRODUCT_LBL SUB_PRODUCT_LBL REFINE_BY_PRODUCT_LBL SEARCH_BY_CATEGORY_CMD CATEGORY_LBL SUB_CATEGORY_LBL REFINE_BY_CATEGORY_LBL Path to edit message bases: Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Message Bases &gt; serach by Key.  Additional Considerations Hotkeys: For more information on editing the hotkey message bases, refer to Answer ID 1776: Modifying Hotkey Text. Hotkeys within the administration workspaces are defined within the workspace itself by editing the LabelText property for the field. Within the LabelText property, include an ampersand (&amp;) immediately prior to the character used as the hotkey. Editing the Â All Products and All Categories labels: In addition, you may want to modify the menu item indicating All products or categories. The ALL_LBL message base is used for both the Product and Category menus to include all menu items in the list. If you edit this message base, it will affect the menu option for both the Product and Category menus. Similarly, the ALL_SUBS_LBL, which is set to ""All Subs"" by default, is used for both products and categories. Generating a report: Additionally, you can review all message bases to determine if other text strings include the words ""product"" or ""category"" within a sentence or text string. To do this, you can generate a report of the message bases and use the find feature to search the report for a specific word. For more information on editing message bases, refer to Answer ID 383: Determining Which Message Base to Edit."

Effect on answer score by end-user and staff activity;Answer ID 574;How is the score of an answer affected by end-user and staff activity?;['Answer ID 383'];  Answer Score / Rating; By default, the answer score feature allows you to have up to 5 response settings for your end-users to rate how well a public answer met their needs and expectations. This allows for a more precise ranking of your answers than is possible on a simple Yes/No basis. The default labels for the solution ratings are percentages (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0%). These options can be modified by editing the associated message bases. For more information on editing message bases, refer to Answer ID 383: Determining Which Message Base to Edit. When your site visitor views an answer and selects a solution rating, the score value is adjusted based on the rating value. You can specify the number of solution ratings by editing the ADP_SC_NUM_OPTIONS configuration setting. Smart Assistant also modifies score values as it tracks customer sessions through the site. The score values are modified whenever an answer is visited, regardless of whether or not the visitor entered a solution rating. The specifics of this functionality is considered proprietary and is patent-protected. It is important to know, though, that this use of answers can affect the overall ranking of the answers listed on your site. The score is affected by activity on the end-user pages. Viewing a public answer from the administration pages does not affect the score. However, if your agents append a link to an answer using the Suggested Solution feature in an incident, the score is increased.

Answers are being removed from our end-user pages;Answer ID 586;Why are public answers being removed from our end-user pages and set to a Review status?;['Answer ID 778', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, Configuration Settings Oracle B2C Service  Issue   I have not set any answers to have a specific review date, yet I have noticed that some of our answers have been assigned to the Review status, even though no one has recently edited those answers. I have also noticed that sometimes public answers are reset to a Private status after they have been edited.;"  Answer Reassigned to Review Status  If the AR_AUTO_ENABLE  Â configuration setting is set to Yes, a public answer will be reassigned to the Review answer status when its score is reduced to zero due to inactivity. As a result, if this setting is enabled, answers may automatically get set to the Review status based on their solved count.  For more information on this feature, see Answer ID 778: Enabling Review On date field when editing answers.  To prevent answers from being set to Review, you can choose to disable this feature or superficially inflate the score for the answer after you re-publish it. To do this, go to the end-user pages and view the answer. Â  Â Then, click that the answer answered your question by 100%. Â  Â View the answer again and select that it answered your question by 100% again. Â  Â If you repeat this action 3-4 times, the score will be increased so that it is no longer 0. As a result, the answer will not get set to Review on the next run of the agedatabase utility, because the score is no longer 0. If you choose to disable this feature and your site has multiple interfaces, if you disable the AR_AUTO_ENABLE setting for one interface, you must disable the setting for all interfaces in your site. If AR_AUTO_ENABLE is enabled on even one interface, it will affect all answers, regardless of which interface the answer is published to.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  Newly Â Published Â Answers: When a new answer is published and the display position is Historical Usefulness, its score is initially zero. Newly published answers cannot be set to Review so long as the ""New"" icon is displayed next to it. This allows the new answer enough time to build up its score while it is listed as new. The ANS_NEW_INC_DURATION  Â configuration setting specifies the number of days after the answer is created (not necessarily from when it was published) that an answer will be flagged as new.  Changing Review Status to Public Status Type: Â  If you would like answers to be assigned to Review but still be published to your site and visible to your site visitors, you can change the status type of the Review status to be public.  From the Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Â Customizable Menus &gt; expand System Menus &gt; select Answer Statuses. Â  Change the status type and click Save &amp; Close.  Setting a Review Date: Answers may still get reassigned to the Review status if you have added and set Â the Review On date field within Â the answer workspace. If a date is set, and has passed, Â for an answer and TC_AR_DATE_ENABLE is enabled, answers will be set to Review.  Public Answers Getting Assigned to a Private Status  Agents without access to set answers to public can edit an answer. Â  Â However, because they do not have the ability to set answers to public, once saved, the answer status will change to private. Â  Â Someone with permissions to publish answers will need to re-set the status back to public.

Setting the time zone in Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 605;How do I set the time zone in myÂ Oracle B2C ServiceÂ application?;['Answer ID 7537', 'Answer ID 8100', 'Answer ID 8974'];   Configuration settings, Time zone Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Â  The TZ_INTERFACE configuration setting allows for the specification of time zones for use in your Oracle B2C Service site.  Â This setting specifies the time zone for the interface.  Â Through Configuration Assistant, this value can be set during site creation, adding a new interface or when editing an interface.  Â  Important Note:  Â This value affects the timestamp used in incidents created and responded to through the specific interface.  Â For this reason, it is recommended this value only be changed in the early stage of an interface lifecycle. Changing the time zone on an established interface is not recommended, as it can lead to issues such as the removal of the SLAs, or the shift of old time metrics. Â SLA Response Interval times and chat hours are both set with a different mechanism in the database. When the time zone Â value changes, these times are not adjusted Â automatically and may be Â skewed as a result. It is also possible to submit a service request to Ask Technical Support Â and indicate the interface and the timezone desired, should a change be needed.  Â NOTE:  Â If the time zone Â on an Â interface or site Â that uses SLAs and/or chat Â is modified by Technical Support, the customer Â will need to adjust Response Interval Times and chat hours after the service request is completed. To view the timezone of an interface you're logged into, see steps in Answer ID 8100: Viewing the time and time zone in the console.  Please review the document below Â of acceptable time zone values. If submitting an incident to Ask Technical Support, let us Â know which time zone is preferred for use on your interface. Acceptable Formats for TZ_INTERFACE:  For specific options and values that can be used with the TZ_INTERFACE setting, refer to the file attachment below. Within the continental United States, you may use EASTERN, CENTRAL, MOUNTAIN, or PACIFIC to designate the time zone. The TZ_INTERFACE should be correctly set Â as each interface is created and should be part of your Best Practices Â interface and site planning. Please see Acceptable Values for TZ_ DST (PDF) Â for a full list and information on which timezones support daylight savings.  GMT should not be selected unless you are certain that the Â interface will not have to adjust for daylight savings time seasonally. For information about Daylight Savings, refer to the following published answer: Answer 8974: Daylight Savings changes are automatic Please note that the operator used in the GMT-type variable is opposite of what might expect. If using the GMT-type format, the GMT-type time zone variable is determined by what adjustment is required in order to make your time match GMT. For example, people in New York need to add 5 hours to the time to match GMT, so the entry for New York using the GMT variable is GMT+5 (not GMT-5). Similarly, people in Sydney, Australia, need to subtract 10 hours from their time to match GMT, so the entry for Sydney is GMT-10 (not GMT+10).

Number of incidents created does not match on different reports;Answer ID 636;How do I create a link to a public answer from outside of Oracle B2C Service?;['Answer ID 486'];  Analytics Oracle B2C Service, All versions; The reports listed below include different values for the number of incidents created on a specific day. This is due to the nature of the report and the tables used as a basis for the report. Â  For example, Â  the Service Summary Report, the Incident Trend Report and the Incident Creation Rate Report. When run for the same day, they report different numbers for the number of incidents created. When Â the Incident Activity Â is run Â and Incident Effectiveness reports, they don't match with the Incident Created reports. Some reports use the Incidents table to generate data, while others rely on the Stats table. If an incident is created, a record is written to the incidents table. If that incident is deleted, the record is removed from the incidents table. Â  As a result, reports that use the incidents table cannot include information about incidents that have been deleted since those records no longer exist. However, once a record is written to the stats table, that data is available for reporting even if the incident Â is deleted later. That is, the corresponding stats record remains in the stats table even though the incident has been deleted from the incidents table. This is why reports that use the stats table typically include counts of records that have been deleted. If the incident exists when the stats table is updated, that record will remain even after an incident is deleted. Brief descriptions for common reports that include incident creation data are listed below. You can determine which tables are used in the report using the following steps: Copy the standard report and open the copy for editing. From the Home tab, click Tables. Â   If you have custom reports that provide different results from a standard report, review which tables Â are configured for each report. Standard reports using Incident Creation data: Â    Operations Dashboard (ID 28): Â This report uses the incidents table for the Table Instances. The Operations Dashboard reports New Incident Activity for yesterday and today. These numbers are real-time and can change throughout the day - even the numbers for yesterday. If an incident from yesterday is deleted today, the number of incidents reported for yesterday is reduced by one since that incident is no longer in the database. Â   Â   Service Summary (ID 36): This report uses the stats table. The Service Summary reports the number of Web Questions, Email Assists, and Incidents from Console. These numbers may differ for a couple of reasons. First, not all incidents are accounted for. For example, if a customer submits Answer Feedback or Site Feedback, an incident is created, but none of the Service Summary categories are incremented.  Â  Another thing to note is that if a customer begins to submit an Ask a Question request and clicks the Stop button on the browser before the transaction is complete, the Web Questions in the Service Summary Report will increment by one even though the incident was never actually created. Â   Â   Incident Trend (ID 85): This report uses the stats table. The information contained in the Incident Trend report is cached when the AGEDATABASE utility runs nightly. When agedatabase runs each night, the number of incidents that were created on a specific day and that still exist in the database are reported on the Incident Trend Report. This number is static so once it is calculated, it will be reported consistently. Â   Â  Â   Incident Activity (ID 88): This report uses the incidents table. The Incident Activity report is intended to track incidents that are currently being processed. Therefore, this report returns only incidents created within the timeframe specified and which have actually been assigned to an agent or a group. If an incident has not been assigned to an agent or group, it will not be included in this report. Â   Â   Incident Effectiveness (ID 81): This report uses the inc_performance table joined with the incidents. The Incident Effectiveness report is designed to measure how effectively incidents are being responded to. Therefore, this report includes any existing incidents created within the timeframe specified which have been initially assigned, initially responded to, or initially solved. If an incident does not match one of these three characteristics, it will not be included in this report. Â   Â   Incident Creation Rate (ID 7): This report uses the stats table. The Incident Creation Rate report is cached. It reports the number of incidents that were created on the specified date and existed in the database at the time agedatabase last ran. If the incident is deleted before agedatabase runs, the statistics do not get updated in the stats table. This is regardless of whether the incident has been assigned to a staff member or if it has been responded to.    Examples: For an example, say that today is May 2 and the following activities occurred on May 1:   On May 1 you had a total of 100 incidents created (150501-000099 was the highest reference number used) and that 75 were email assists and 25 were submitted through the Ask a Question page. Â   Â  Â  Â   At 5:00 PM on May 1, the administrator of your site deleted 5 of the incidents created that day. Â  Â   Â   The agedatabase utility ran at 2:00 a.m. on May 2. Â  Â   Â   At 8:00 a.m. on May 2, your administrator deleted 10 more incidents which were created on May 1 (the previous day). Â    At 9:00 a.m. on May 2 you run your reports. The following number of incidents are reported for May 1.   Operations Dashboard New Incident Activity for Yesterday: 85 (there were 100, but since 15 were deleted only 85 remain) Â   Â   Service Summary for May 1: 100 Â   Â   Incident Trend for May 1 on Created Incidents: 95 (5 of the 100 had been deleted when AGEDATABASE ran) Â   Â   Incident Creation Rate for May 1: 95 (again, there were 100, but since 5 were deleted before AGEDATABASE ran)   Â  Due to the nature of the utilities and whether or not incidents have been deleted, the number of incidents created will vary between reports.

Â  Create the workflow rule similar to the following: IF Incident Source Â equals Answer Feedback and/or Site Feedback THEN E-Mail Incident Information to Â (add e-mail addresses in the resulting text box) or highlight staff accounts. Use the CTRL key to highlight multiple staff accounts. The email addresses and staff accounts Â specified in the THEN part of the rule will receive email notifications for all incidents created from feedback specified for the incident source type.  Notifying answer owner of Â answer feedback: When feedback is submitted for an answer on your site, you can configure a rule to assign the feedback incident directly to the staff member who owns the answer. Set up the rule to use the Â  Assign incident to staff member assigned the answer action. The rule Â will look like: IF Incident Source Â equals Answer Feedback THEN Assign incident to staff member assigned the answer  Â  In addition, in the email messages table, ensure that the Incident Assigned message is enabled. That way, when the incident is assigned to the staff member who owns the answer, the incident assigned message is distributed to the owner of the answer.

Creating a custom report that only reports on three categories;Answer ID 640;How can I create a custom report that allows me to combine data across more than one category?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics Oracle B2C Service, All versions  Issue   I want to create a custom report that tracks incidents across only some of the categories I use. For example, we have six categories, but I want to report on the incidents associated with only three of those categories.;"  When configuring a report filter that is based on a menu or hierarchical menu, you can use the ""in list"" operator for the filter and then select multiple items from the available values. To configure a report that defaults to search on multiple categories (or products), use the steps below:  From the Report Editor, select New &gt; Report &gt; select type of report.   From the Home tab, click Â Filters from the Data Set section. Â    In the pop-up window, in the Definition section, right click in the Expression field and select Incidents &gt; Category Hierarchy (or Product Hierarchy).   Set the Operator field to ""in list"".   In the Value area, enable or disable appropriate values based on your search criteria. You can expand a top-level category to view the associated sub-categories. This allows you to enable or disable specific sub-values as well.   Click OK.   Configure the rest of your report and click Save to name and save your report.  When a user runs the report, the Category filter will default to the items that are enabled in the report configuration.

Adding, editing, or removing Service products or categories;Answer ID 645;How do I add, edit, or remove products or categories in the drop-down menus?;['Answer ID 2260', 'Answer ID 1179'];  Service Products/Categories;" Products and sub-products are defined in the Products table. Categories and sub-categories are defined in the Categories table. When creating a new product or category, the name is restricted to 40 characters and cannot be modified to be longer in length. When adding a new sub-product or sub-category, review your workflow rules and enable the new sub-product or sub-category in the appropriate rules. When a product or category is enabled in a workflow rule, new sub-items are not automatically included in the workflow rule. For this reason, you need to edit each workflow rule that uses the parent product or category in the IF criteria of the rule. You Â can have up to six levels of products and categories. Use the steps below to add, edit or remove products and categories: Path to access products and categories: From the Â Configuration items, select Â Service &gt; Â Products/Categories/Dispositions. Â  Â   Â  To add a new item: Â Click Â in the Â column you want to Â add a new item to and then click the Â New button on the ribbon. Or, To edit a product, right-click and select Edit.  Name: Enter the common name of the item.  Visibility: For each interface listed, enable the appropriate check boxes regarding administrative visibility or end-user visibility. If you enable the Administration visibility box, the item will appear in the Products or Categories menu for both incidents and answers when viewed from the administration console. Â It is not possible to enable the Â product or category Â to be visible for only incidents and not answers or vice versa. This also enables visibility as a filter option within a report. Note: If you enable administration visibility for a product or category and when you create new answers, you can assign the answer to a product or category that has only administration visibility enabled. This allows you to create answers ahead of time for new products that you are rolling out in the near future. Â   Â  Description: Click on the Description button on the ribbon. Information entered in the Description field displays when the end-user clicks the icon from the Answers end-user page.  Â  After defining the name, visibility and description Â and Â click Save. Â   Â  To add a sub-item: Â  Â To add an item at the same level, right click on a value and select Add Â Sibling. To add a sub-item, right-click and select Add Child. You can also create the item as a product or category and then drag and drop the item on the value that will be the parent product or category. When you drop the item, it will be listed under its parent and will be indented as an indicator that it is now a sub-item. Â   Â  Â  Â   Important Considerations  Â  Deleting Products or Categories: Â  You can delete a product or category by right clicking on it or simply highlighting it and selecting the Delete option. Â  However, you cannot delete a product or category if an answer is assigned to that value. Â Therefore, before you can delete a product or category, you must search for all answers assigned to that item and remove the answers from being assigned to that value. Â  If you try to delete a product or category that has answers assigned to it, you will get a dependency conflict message that indicates which answers are still assigned to that value. Â  (Note: Beginning with the August '09 release, deleting products and categories will not generate warnings). Â  Â For more information on dependency conflicts, refer to Answer ID 2260: Dependency conflicts when editing products, staff, or custom fields. Disabling Administrative Visibility: If administrative visibility is removed from a product or category, the product/category will be disassociated from all answers tied to that product/category. Â  Â This can cause the affected answers to no longer appear on the enduser pages if the answers are not associated with other enduser visible products/categories. Â  Â Re-adding administrative visibility to the product/category will not automatically reassociate the product/category to the affected answers. Â  Â Instead, each answer must be manually associated with the product/category for which administrative visibility was removed.  Moving Products or Categories: You can move products and categories, including sub-values, Â without receiving a dependency notification. When you move Â an item, the answer retains its relationship to the product or category value. For example, if an answer is assigned to product B and you move product B to be a sub-product under product A, the answer will still be assigned to what is Â now sub-product B that is listed under product A. Disabling End-User Visibility: Answers retain their association to the product or category if the end-user visibility is removed. Effects on Incidents: In all versions, incidents remain associated with the item or sub-item wherever it is moved, so if incidents are assigned to product A and sub-product B, the incidents will be assigned to the B value if it is moved to become a product. For more information, see Answer ID 1179: Effect on incidents and answers when moving or deleting products or categories."

Allowing anyone to use the Ask a Question page;Answer ID 649;How do I allow any of our site visitors to be able to ask a question?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 2260', 'Answer ID 1179'];"  Customer Portal, End-user pages Issue  Some visitors have tried to submit a question but when they tried to log in with their email address, theyÃ‚Â receive a ""Login Failed"" message."; The default configuration of customer portal pageset allows anyone to submit a question from the Ask a Question tab. Â  Â The user does NOT have to have a full account to submit a question. Â  Â (If they only have a partial account, they cannot log in to see the question or update from the Your Account page, but they can submit questions just fine.) Additionally, also by default, the Login page includes the option for end-users to create a new account. Users can click the Create a New Account (or Sign Up) button and complete the form to define their email address, login, and password along with other requested information. You can configure your end-user pages to remove the Create a New Account button so that users cannot create a new account. Â  With this configuration, end-users must have a contact record in the database in order to submit incidents from the Â Ask Â A Question Â page. This allows you to Â designate specific contacts Â who have the ability to submit incidents to your support group.

Preventing incidents based on specific types of file attachments;Answer ID 657;How can I prevent incidents from being created from email with specific types of file attachments?;['Answer ID 2260', 'Answer ID 1179'];Incoming Emails, Mailbox Configuration / Filtering options; When configuring a mailbox in Oracle B2C Service, you can list specific types of file attachments that will not be allowed with incoming email.  Restricting File Attachments Allowed Each mailbox has two distinct fields, Discard MIME Types and Discard File Types. These fields allow you to specify types of files that will not be attached to an incident created from mail sent to the mailbox. Multiple entries must be in a comma-separated list or with a single value per line. To prevent incidents from being created for emails that have a *.exe or *.vbs extension, edit each mailbox and include *.exe, *.vbs Â  Â in the Discard File Types field. For a concise list of MIME types alphabetized by literal extension, refer to http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types  Preventing Incident Creation Editing the Discard MIME Types and Discard File Types fields in the mailbox prevents the files from being attached to the incoming incident, but the incident is still created from the email -- minus the attachment. If you want to prevent the incident from being created as well, you can configure a Â rule to not create the incident based on contents of the subject or body of the email: IF: Incident Source: Email If Incident.Customer thread matches regular expression bytes If Incident.Customer thread matches regular expression discarded If Incident.Customer thread matches regular expression application If Incident.Customer thread matches regular expression Attachment Then: Do not create incident.** All of the IF statements should be joined by the AND connector. These words will all be present together in incidents generated with deleted attachments. This rule should be placed first in your list of rules. Note: Consider starting off with a rule that allows the incident to be created (minus the attachment) and assigns the Â incident to a specific group or sets it to the Solved status instead of not creating the incident. This allows you to review which incidents are coming in and are being affected by the rule to ensure that you are not preventing valid incidents from being created.

Determining when answers were last viewed;Answer ID 664;How can I see when our answers were last viewed?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 2260', 'Answer ID 1179'];  Analytics for Answer Usage;" When I run the Answers Viewed report, I get a list of which answers have been used within the specified time frame. Can I get a list of which answers were NOT used in that time frame? I would like to see which ones have not been viewed in several weeks. The Answers Viewed report does not include answers that were not viewed in the time period specified. Therefore, the Answers Viewed report cannot be used to identify which answers have not been viewed recently. The Answers Last Access Time standard report uses the Answer Stats table to determine the date and time the answer was last viewed from your end-user pages. The run-time filters in the report allow you to select which interface(s) to include. To run the report, use the steps below: From the Analytics tab, open the Reports Explorer.  Â  Navigate to the Public Reports &gt; Service &gt; Site Reports folder and double click on the Answers Last Access Time report (Report ID 140).  Â  Set the run-time filters and click Search.  Join between tables: This report uses an inner join to join the answers and answers_stats tables. As a result, only answers that have been viewed at some point are included in the report. If you wish to include all answers in the report, including answers that have never been viewed, copy the report and edit the copy to use an outer join between the tables. Â  You can switch the table join from the Data Set window. From the report location above, right click on the report and select Copy. Select a folder and add a name for the copy.

Evaluating how end-users are using the Oracle B2C Service site;Answer ID 667;How can we get an indication of how well Oracle B2C Service is working for us and how often the site is being used by our end-users?;['Answer ID 569'];   Analytics Oracle B2C Service;  Generating one or more of the standard reports allows you to gain insight as to how your site visitors are using Oracle B2C Service to find answers to their questions on their own. The standard reports listed below are quite useful for learning how your Oracle B2C Service application is being used by your site visitors.  Â  The Service Summary Â  reports includes graphs which display information about the number of answers viewed, the number of searches performed and the number of questions submitted, by both Ask a Question submittals and email. By comparing these numbers, you can get a feel of how your site visitors are using your site. For example, if you compare the total of Answers viewed, Smart Assists and Searches performed to the total of the Web Questions and Email Questions, you can get an indication of how often a request is submitted compared to how much your customers are searching for and viewing answers themselves. In addition, you can compare the totals above to the number of sessions. If the number of submitted requests is comparatively high compared to the number of sessions, that means that your customers are not using the online answers as much as they possibly could be. This may be due to customer inexperience and they are simply submitting assistance requests without trying to find the answer themselves. If the number of Answers viewed and Searches performed is much larger than the number of sessions, then your end-users are viewing and searching more than once per session, which could mean they are having difficulty finding the correct answer to solve their issue. For more information on the items reported in the Service Summary, refer to Answer ID 569: Using the Service Summary Report.  Â  The  Â Visit Tracking Â  report provides information on where the site visitor begins and ends their session (on which page). By looking at the percentage of how often a session ends on the Ask a Question page, you can get an idea of how often an end-user was unable to find an Answer themselves. You would like this percentage to be low.  Â  The Answers Viewed report provides information on how many times your answers were viewed in a specified time frame. You can also drill-down on a specific time unit to see which answers were viewed the most and which were viewed the least. This indicates which answers are most valuable for the time period you select.  Â  The Keyword Search report provides a list of words and phrases that were used in a text search for the time frame you specify when you generate the report. By reviewing the words and phrases listed in the report, you can identify areas of the knowledge base that may need additional answers to cover topics that were searched on. You can also identify synonyms and other common words that should be added to existing answers as keywords so that those answers will be found more easily based on the words used by your site visitors.

Set the number of Answers displayed to be 10.  From Reports Explorer within the console, open the report Â in edit mode that displays on the answers/list.php. Â Click the Â Display tab on the ribbon and then click the Page report Â dropdown menu. In the dropdown list select 10 Rows per page and Save the report. For more information on editing the report used for your answers on the end-user pages, refer to the online documentation for Edit the Published Answers page.  Edit the 5 NEW Answers to be Fixed at Top  Next, edit each of the five new answers so that they are fixed at the top of the answer list. Select Fix at Top from the Display Position drop-down menu and save/update the answer. This sets these answers to be the top five answer on the list page. The rest of the answers will follow in order based on their solved count, which is a reflection of how much the answer is accessed and how useful the information is. In this way, the remaining five slots on the list will be the top five answers that are accessed and useful to your site visitors.

Editing or deleting multiple incidents at the same time;Answer ID 690;How do I edit or delete multiple incidents at the same time?;['Answer ID 1894'];   Incidents Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  The Oracle B2C Service application includes functionality that allows staff members the ability to edit, reassign, and delete multiple incidents. Â  Specific privileges are granted to staff members from their staff profile. Staff can also edit groups of other answers, such as answers, contacts, or opportunities. For more information on editing multiple records in Oracle B2C Service, refer to Answer ID 1894: Editing Multiple Records.  The fields that can be edited when using the multi-edit function are controlled by the Multi-Edit Incident workspace that is listed in the staff profile. To edit multiple incidents, use the steps below:  Run a report that returns the incidents that you are interested in editing.  Â  Use the CTRL or Shift key to select a group of incidents in the report output.  Â  Right click and select Open &gt; Incident, the multi-edit workspace displays.  Â  Edit the appropriate fields and click Save.  The staff member can also select the group of records, right click and select Â Reassign to assign that group of incidents to a different staff member. Note: When you Â edit or reassign Â the items, the Â report may not automatically refresh, depending on the configuration of the report, so it may appear that the records are still in the database. Click the Refresh option in the toolbar to verify that the records are listed (or not listed) in the report based on your update. To reassign multiple incidents to another staff member, highlight the incidents of interest and then right-click and Â select Assign &gt; Incidents. This bring up the list of staff groups and staff accounts so that you can easily reassign the selected incidents to the staff member. To delete multiple incidents, select the incidents, right-click and select Delete &gt; Incident(s). Confirm that you indeed want to delete the incidents. Your profile must allow delete privileges. Important!: Use extreme caution when deleting multiple incidents. Once an incident is deleted, it is deleted from the database entirely and cannot be retrieved. Note: When you delete the items, the top grid may not automatically refresh, depending on the configuration of your view, so it may appear that the records are still in the database. Click the Refresh icon in the console to verify that the records are no longer in the database.   "

Viewing contacts from only one interface;Answer ID 695;We have multiple interfaces. Can weÃ‚Â arrange it so that each interface only sees their customers and contacts?;['Answer ID 1894'];  Analytics, Contacts, Incidents; In the Â Oracle B2C Service database, there is no field within the contact record that establishes if the record was created from one interface or another. However, incident and contact records can be opened from the same report. Therefore, if you Â create a report Â that lists Â incidents submitted through a specific interface, you can access Â all the contacts associated with those incidents. Since the incidents have a system-defined field for interface, you can create a report that lists all contacts that have an incident associated with the specific interface of interest. In the report, include a filter on the incidents.interface_id field. Then when the report is run, you can open either the incident or contact record. Only contacts who have submitted incidents would be visible and accessible using the incidents report. Â  If you need to be able to view contacts for the interface who have not submitted an incident, you can define a contact custom field (named Interface) for example, and set the custom field to the appropriate interface. Then, create a report that filters the contact record based on the value of the interface custom field.

Allowing the score of unused answers to decay faster;Answer ID 698;How can I allow the score of unused answers to decay faster?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, Agedatabase settings;"  The SA_AGE_FREQ  Â configuration setting specifies the aggressiveness of the SmartAssistant Data Aging process. Aging includes both reducing the score values of answers and deleting links between answers. With this setting, aging is automated and responsive, creating a more easily managed and more usable knowledge base. The setting ranges from 0 - 400 and the set value corresponds to the approximate number of days that will pass before an unsued answer will be aged. Note: Â  The aging process occurs during the Agedatabase utility run. Â  Â  A transaction is written for each answer that is decayed during that Agedatabase run. Â  Although the Agedatabase utility runs nightly, the frequency of decaying is based on the configuration setting identified above so transactions for decayed answers occur at these intervals. Â  Over time the answer may have many decaying transactions. Â  These transactions indicate the history of aging for a particular answer. Â   Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.

Backing up a file when using the File Manager;Answer ID 711;How do I back up a file that is accessible through the File Manager? I would like to edit some files, but need to create backups first.;['Answer ID 5168'];   File Manager;  When working with the File Manager, we strongly recommend that you keep backup copies of the files you customize. In the event that you need to revert to an old version of a file, you will be able to easily restore to a working file. Also, during an update process, any customized files in the enduser directory will be reset to the default configuration if that file has new content for the updated version. Files in the enduser/cci sub-directory are not over-written during the update process. Permanent, read-only backup copies of the original, installed files are created during installation. When creating a backup, you can copy a file in the File Manager and specify the name and directory of the backup file or you may download the file to your local machine and maintain your backup files locally. The steps below provide instructions for both methods. Note: Within the File Manager, file names cannot include spaces or other special characters such as # or @.  Â  The File Manager includes a backup feature that creates a backup file in the backup directory whenever a file is modified. However, the backup directory only retains one version back as the backup. That is, when you save a file, the previously saved file becomes the backup. If you make several changes to a file, only the most recently edited version is available as the backup file. For this reason, we recommend that you save any customized, implemented files using one of the methods below. The File Manager also maintains permanent, read-only copies of the originally installed default files in the default directory. These backup and default files provide you with additional assurance as you customize files that you can easily revert to the last working file or to the original default file. In this way, you can make modifications with limited risk of functionality loss or undue down time to your live production site. The files in both the backup and default directories cannot be edited or overwritten. You can only view and download the files in the default and backup directories. Caution! We strongly recommend that you keep backup copies of the files you customize on disk, local machine, or network. During an update to a site, the files in the backup directory are over-written with the working files from the previous version. For more information on using the File Manager refer to Â Administrator manual for 8.0 and later releases.  To make a backup copy of a file using the download feature:   Click the download icon next to the file ( ). Click Save This File to Disk and click OK which opens the Save As window. Navigate to the directory where you want to save the file. Type the name of the file using a naming convention for backups. For example, if the file name is assigned.phph, you may want to create a file named assignedphph.back or assignedphph.old. Be consistent with your companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s naming conventions. Click Save to download the file to your local machine. This file will be the backup copy of the current, working file. You may edit the actual file as necessary by using the edit feature or by downloading the file to your local machine.  Â   To make a backup copy of a file using the copy feature:   Click the Copy icon next to the file ( ). This opens a page that contains the copy, move, and rename features. Copy is the default function. Type the name of the file using a naming convention for backups in the To text box. For example, if the filename is assigned.phph, you may want to create a file named assignedphph.back or assignedphph.old. Be consistent with your companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s naming conventions.  Note: To create the backup copy in the same directory as the existing file, do not alter the path before the filename.  Â  Click Save to create a copy of the file. This file will be the backup copy of the current, working file. With the backup created, you may edit the actual file as necessary by using the edit feature or by downloading the file to your local machine.

Review the Â Audience tab to see if surveys are being unexpected limited: Â   Excluded audience: Â  On the Audiences tab, you can add a contact list or segment of contacts to exclude from receiving the survey. Â  If the contact is part of an excluded contact list or segment, that contact will not receive the survey.  Â  Limit frequency of communication: Â  If the check box is enabled, the survey is configured to limit how many messages a contact can receive in a specified period of time. Â  If the contact has already received that number, then they will not receive the additional survey.   Limit recency of communication: Â  If enabled, the Â survey is configured to limit how often contacts can receive a survey. If the contact has received another survey within the time period specified, the contact will not receive this survey.   Limit delivery to a randomly selected subset of the audience: Â  If enabled, the survey will only be selected to a Â percentage of your audience so that fewer surveys are sent compared to the overall size of your audience.   Global opt-in and external suppression list: Â  Â These boxes are enabled by default. Contacts who are globally opted out Â or are on the Â external suppression list do not receive the survey (provided the corresponding checkboxes are enabled in the survey).  For a Â broadcast survey, you can also define the delivery rate when the survey is sent. Click the Delivery tab and review the configuration in the Delivery Options box.

Display order and number of columns for custom fields;Answer ID 715;Can I control the display order of custom fields?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Custom Fields, Workspaces;"  The Â order of fields is controlled by the workspace used by the staff member who edits the record. As a result, the order of custom fields is completely customizable by editing the appropriate workspace. Within the workspace configuration, you can position fields in multiple columns or on different tabs. The workspace is called out in the staff member's profile. With the flexibility of workspaces, administrators can also make fields visible to specific staff or staff groups by creating custom workspaces. With multiple workspaces, some staff members can be granted access to certain fields or groups of fields (by adding the fields to their workspace) while other staff members might not be able to see the fields at all (if those fields were not added to the workspace). Note: Use care when creating additional, custom workspaces. It is best to keep the overall number of workspaces to a minimum so that they can be maintained and managed more easily over time. To determine which workspace is used by a staff member: Â   Open the staff account to determine the staff profile. Use the path: Â Configuration Items &gt; Staff Management &gt; Staff Accounts by Group.  Â  Open the staff profile from the Staff Management &gt; Profiles.  Â  Click the Interfaces button located on the ribbon. The workspaces are specified on the Workspaces / Workflows tab.  Â  With the workspace name, you can then open or copy the workspace from the Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces / Workflows."

Our new rule is not working correctly;Answer ID 723;I have created a new rule, but it does not seem to execute properly. What can I check to get it to work correctly?;['Answer ID 1873'];  Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;" Sometimes getting business rules to function as you expect them to can be tricky. Sometimes, the rule itself may need to be edited, but other times the rule is fine, but its relationship with other rules in your list may cause problems. If you are having difficulty getting your rule(s) to execute as you expect, review the items below:   Activate the Ruleset -- Â You must activate the changes to your rulebase. When you edit rules, you are actually editing a copy of your rules, which you must then activate. After you have edited your rules, click the Activate button in the lower section of the right frame. You can tell if the copy of the rulebase has not been activated recently by checking the Created date for the copied rulebase. When you first open rules in edit mode, the right frame lists the date the copy was created and by whom. It also lists when the copy was last edited and by whom. If the date that it was created is not close to the current date and time, this indicates that the copy of the rulebase was created some time ago, but never activated. Therefore, any changes you made to the copy of the rulebase have never actually been implemented. Â   Â   Placement Order -- If your rule is placed too low in your list, the incident may end up being affected by a different rule that is placed higher in the list. As a result, you might think that the rule is not working. Â  Use the Rule Log to determine if other rules acted upon the incident before it could match the rule that you expected. For more information on the Rule Log, refer to Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log to troubleshoot rules.  Â   Check the rule itself -- Review the rule as you have created it. Verify that the Incident Source is correct and that the fields and criteria specified in the IF part of the rule are appropriate and correct. Also, verify that the action(s) specified in the THEN part of the rule accomplish all the actions you want to execute. Â   Â   EQUALS Operator -- The EQUALS operator should only be used if you know the exact value of the field; for example, the exact name of the menu option for a custom field. The EQUALS operator is case-sensitive in evaluating the value field. That is, make sure you have capitalized the entry in the value text box appropriately. The EQUALS or NOT EQUALS operators are used primarily with values used in drop-down menus, such as custom fields. Note: When working with text fields, do NOT use the EQUALS operator. This includes the Incident.Summary or Incident.Customer thread. Instead use CONTAINS or MATCHES REGULAR EXPRESSION. Â   Â   CONTAINS Operator -- When using the CONTAINS or DOES NOT CONTAIN operator, do NOT include wildcards around the text that you specify in the Value field. That is, do not enter %specific text% in the field; instead just enter the specific text of interest.   Â   Pipe Functionality ( | ) for OR Logic -- If you are using the pipe ( | ) as an OR function for matching text, you must use either the MATCHES REGULAR EXPRESSION or DOES NOT MATCH REGULAR EXPRESSION operator. Also, do not include a pipe at the beginning or end of the entry in the value field. Also, do not include a space between the pipe and the text sequence. Â   Â   Testing the Rule -- When creating a test incident, make sure you are creating the incident from the appropriate Incident Source with the appropriate criteria to match ALL of the conditions of the IF section of the rule."

Appending specific answers when responding to incidents;Answer ID 739;How can we append specific answers when responding to incidents?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Incident Response Messages, Appending Answers (link or text) Oracle B2C Service, All versions  Issue   Rather than including a link, we were hoping that we could append the actual text in the message.;"  When responding to an incident, you can append an answer to the Response field in one of two ways. You can append a link to the answer or you can append the content (text) of the answer directly to the response field. If you know the answer ID for the answer you want to append, you can use the Quick Answer shortcut to append the answer most efficiently. When appending the text of an answer, if the text you append includes links to other answers, those links do not work from the incident. In addition, if you use HTML in the content of the answer, the HTML code will display in the incident when viewed from the administration console. If the Incident Response email message is HTML enabled, the HTML will be rendered in the outgoing message. If the answer you append contains answer variables, the variable is rendered in the response sent to the customer. However, the variable does not render Â in the administration console when viewing the incident thread or when the customer views the incident from the Account Overview Â page. Note: The SA_APPEND_QUESTION  Â configuration setting allows you to specify whether both the question and answer fields are appended when appending the text of an answer or if only the answer field is appended. If SA_APPEND_QUESTION is set to Yes, both the question and answer are appended.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings. Shortcut keys: If you know the answer ID to append, use the F9 key to append the answer text or F10 to append a link to that answer. In the pop-up window, enter the answer ID and click Enter. Â  Searching: If you do not know the answer ID to append, Â click the Search Knowledgebase button from the open incident and search for the answer using the filters available in the pop-up window.  For additional information, refer to the 'Append Answer Content' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Sending a file attachment to the end-user with the incident response;Answer ID 740;When we attach files to an incident, the recipient does not receive any of the attachments. How can we fix this?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Incident File Attachments Oracle B2C Service, November 2015 and newer;"  When you attach a file to an incident or incident response, that file becomes permanently attached to the incident. Sending files with an incident response: When a file is sent with the response, the end-user receives the file as an attachment to the response they receive. The file is also automatically and permanently attached to the incident. Â The response thread is the only thread type a file can be sent with. Â  If a file is attached in the same edit a thread is added on the Messages tab (the file attachment and the incident thread are saved at the same time), an Attachments indicator displays in the title bar of the thread on the Messages tab after the incident is saved. Click the Attachments drop-down menu to display attachments added at the time the thread entry was saved, then click a file name to view the file.  To send a file with an incident response: When certain conditions are met, the Response title bar expands and the paperclip attachment symbol displays. (A) The first scenario requires that Send on Save is used. As soon as Send on Save is activated the symbol will show. (B) The second scenario requires showing email message headers. This can be configured by agents within the options area of the thread control or it can be configured in the workspace editor within the Response Options for the thread control. Make sure one of the conditions required to show the attachment symbol are met. Once available:  Click the Paperclip Attach Symbol to open the Attachments window. To send the response with one or more files that are permanently attached to the incident, select the associated check boxes in the Incident Files section of the Attachments window. To attach additional files to the incident response, click the Add Files button in the Response Files section and select Browse to view the files and folders on your workstation. Or select Search to open the File Search window.   If you selected Browse, select the file and click the Open button to attach it to the response.  If you selected Search, specify a directory, all or part of a file name, and the type of file. Click the Search button. The select one or more of the matching files and click the Add Files button to upload the selected file and attach it to the response.   Click OK Draft the response and Save the incident  NOTE: At this point, the Attachments drop down in the thread title bar will indicate the attachment was ""Sent in this response"" and list the file name(s). Â  Â Additionally, from the Attachments tab, you can see the response file was also automatically and permanently attached to the incident."

Error Processing Email or Invalid Message error in an incident;Answer ID 743;Why am I getting Error Processing Email or Invalid Message errors in incidentsÃ‚Â in our administration console?;['Answer ID 1569', 'Answer ID 1853', 'Answer ID 908'];   Techmail, Incidents Oracle B2C Service;  An incident with the subject Error Processing Incident is created when the techmail utility encounters an unrecoverable error. Â  Â The techmail utility either exits immediately on the error and does not shut down the process in a controlled manner or rolls back the transaction and exits with an error. This techmail error occurs due to some issue/misconfiguration within the site setup including but not limited to these common issues.  Customization Business Rules Configuration or Message Base values Parsing the HTML of the message Something in the raw message    When an unrecoverable error occurs, the techmail utility notes that the last message was not processed on the last run. Because the message was not processed correctly on the last run of techmail, an Error Processing Incident is created on the next run of techmail without trying to reprocess the message. If an error occurred during the techmail run, an error code is indicated in the Utility Last Run log. For more information on viewing the Utility Last Run log, refer to Answer ID 1569: Links on Site Tools and Account pages on Oracle B2C Service Technical Support site. If a database error occurred, the error is reported in the System Error Log. Staff members whose profile allows access to the Error Log will receive an error notification in the Communication Center. For more information on the System Error Log, refer to Answer ID 1853: Error Log and System Error Notifications. Note: Â  Â The message base ERROR_PROCESSING_EMAIL_MSG is the value entered in the subject and will be different per language. Â  Â For convenience a site may configure the message base to be the same across all interfaces for consistent reporting on these types of incidents. Reporting Error Processing Incidents: The creation of an Error Processing Incident indicates an email message that was not processed correctly. Â Please note this is expected functionality to avoid data loss and intermittent occurrences are nothing to worry about. However, if Â they begin to happen regularly with increased frequency Â an investigation Â may be Â needed to determine the cause of the unrecoverable error. Should you decide to submit a service request to Â Technical Support, Â please provide any observation details on the Error Processing Incidents such as:  Started on such and such a date Comes from a common contact or domain Only occurs on incidents created from a specific mailbox and/or interface A customization was recently implemented System errors correspond to the incident creation  Note: Â  Â Depending on the frequency of occurrence, the troubleshooting duration and methods will change. Â  Â To troubleshoot means capturing the error as it occurs which can take time if Error Processing Incidents are created infrequently. Handling Error Processing Incidents: For each incident where this issue occurred, there should be an attached message.txt file with the actual contents of the email message so you can respond to your contact. Note that there is no data loss for this issue as the attachment is the entire original raw email that was sent by the end-user. You can view the message.txt attachment in a in a friendly format much like an email client rather than the email text file by doing the following:  Save the file to your desktop as message.mht. Open the file from your Desktop. It should open in a browser window in a readable format. Upload the file to the incident if appropriate and save the incident.  *Note: Many times it is also possible to change the file extension to .eml and open the attachment in outlook.  The recommended best practice in these events is to view either the original message file in a text editor or the saved message.mht file, and (if appropriate) copy the content into a new incident in your system, as follows:  If you can identify some text relating to a support issue, you can copy it out and paste it into a new incident. If you see text indicating that the message is an update to an existing incident, look for the incident number somewhere in the content and use it to identify the intended incident in your database. Then copy and paste the text of the update message into a new thread in that incident to manually update it. If the file is unreadable or contains words associated with spam, you can treat the incident consistent with your process for handling incidents originating from junk mail. For more information regarding spam refer to Answer ID 908: Preventing SPAMjunk-type email from becoming incidents.  Since the original email is attached, you can open the attachment to determine the contact and incident information and either update the existing incident or manually create an incident from the contents of the attachment.

Setting a product or category for email requests;Answer ID 777;How do I remove the Unspecified option for the Product and Category field for incidents created from email requests?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 486'];   Incoming Incident Routing, Business Rules, All versions;"  When submitting a request via email, your customers have no means to assign a product or category value to the incident created since there is no field to specify in the email itself. As a result, by default, incoming email requests are assigned to be Unspecified. You can use business rules, however, to assign products and/or categories to incoming email requests. Note: Keep in mind that assigning fields based on the content of the email is not perfect in that customers may or may not include certain words or phrases in their request. For this reason, the business rule may not catch all of the incidents you would like. To do this, you can configure a rule similar to the examples below where the Incident Source is equal to Email and the THEN part of the rule sets the appropriate field(s): uses the Set Product or Set Category option from the Add Additional Action drop-down menu:  Set the Incident Source to be E-mail.   Click Add Another Condition and select Incident.Summary (the Subject of the e-mail) or Incident.Description (the body of the email).   For the Operator select either CONTAINS or MATCHES REGULAR EXPRESSION and then you can enter a word or phrase in the Value field.   Add additional IF conditions as necessary. Note: If you want to assign fields based on the mailbox the request is sent to, select Incident.Mailbox EQUALS mailbox name from Mailboxes table. Be sure to use the NAME of the mailbox, not the e-mail address to which the mail is sent.   For the action, Â select Set Field &gt; Product or Category.

Enabling Review On date field when editing answers;Answer ID 778;What are the Review On date fields used for when editing an answer?;['Answer ID 1429', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, Administrator Notifications Oracle B2C Service;  Over time, the content of your answers may become outdated. Consequently, your public answers should be reviewed with some frequency to ensure their content is current, relevant, and useful. You may wish to review answers at a set frequency, such as every six months, or you may wish to review answers to coincide with new product releases or updates. When enabled on your site, the Review On date field displays when adding or editing answers. If a review date is set, on the review date, the status of the answer changes from Public or any other status that is a public Â status type to the Review status. The Review On date field value (answers.expires) is also cleared by agedatabase at that time. Note: If the status is manually changed to Review, the Review On date field value will not be automatically cleared. Â  Â If the answer is then set back to Public, be sure to either clear the review date from the date field or set a new date for some time in the future. If you merely edit the answer to set it to a public status and leave the past review date, the answer will get set to Review the next time the agedatabase utility runs. You can enable the Answer Reviewed notification. When enabled, a notification is sent to staff member assigned to the answer when that answer's status is changed to Review. For more information on this feature, refer to Answer 1429: Notifying Staff for Answers in Review Status. The Review On field is controlled by the answer workspace. Â  You can drag and drop the Review On field to be included in the workspace used by your staff members.

Requiring certain fields with submitted incidents;Answer ID 780;How do we set the fields and drop-down menus to be required before the customer can submit a question?;['Answer ID 1429', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Customer PortalÃ‚Â CP v3.x, Ask a Question page Oracle B2C Service;"  The steps to set a field as required when submitting an Ask a Question request depend on which field you wish to set. Important! The information below Â only affects incidents created from Ask a Question submittals. Incidents created from other sources such as:  email requests (if EGW_ENABLED is set to Yes), answer or site feedback, or responses to mailings  ...cannot require fields to be filled out since the submittal method does not give the contact the opportunity to set the fields. For example, when an email is submitted, there is no way for the contact to set a product, category or other custom field. Similarly, when an incident is created from answer or site feedback, there is no means for the contact to set product, category, or custom Â fields that are required on the Ask a Question page. You can set up business rules to set custom fields to a default value for incidents created from email submittals or other sources. When configuring the rule, include the Incident Source field in the IF part of the rule to specify the types of incidents that will have the fields set by the rule.  Requiring custom fields: Â When configuring custom fields, Â the Required check box makes the field required on the end-user pages (when the field is enabled for end-user visibility). This applies to both incident custom fields added to the Ask a Question page and contact custom fields enabled on the Create Â Account page. Â The Required check box also sets the default property for the custom field when it is added to a workspace. Â  However, within a specific workspace, an administrator can set the Required Â property to Never or On New or On Edit so that the field is never required or only sometimes required when the record is edited from the Oracle B2C Service Console. Â  As a result, for incidents created from the administrative console, some fields may not be required -- even if the fields are required from the end-user pages.  Product and Category Fields  For Customer Â Portal CP3 Widget version 2.0.1 or lower If you are using Â Customer Portal, the standard ProductCategoryInput widget can be edited to require a product or category during the incident submission. Â  Â Below are some examples of some edits made to the ProductCategoryInput widget to make the product and category required fields; &lt;rn:widget path=""input/ProductCategoryInput"" table=""incidents"" required_lvl=""2"" data_type=""products""/&gt; &lt;rn:widget path=""input/ProductCategoryInput"" table=""incidents"" required_lvl=""2"" data_type=""categories"" label_input=""#rn:msg:CATEGORY_LBL#"" label_nothing_selected=""#rn:msg:SELECT_A_CATEGORY_LBL#""/&gt;  CustomerPortal v3.3 Widget version 2.1.1 and higher &lt;rn:widget path=""input/ProductCategoryInput"" table=""incidents"" required_lvl=""2"" /&gt; &lt;rn:widget path=""input/ProductCategoryInput"" table=""incidents"" required_lvl=""2"" Â  label_input=""#rn:msg:CATEGORY_LBL#"" label_nothing_selected=""#rn:msg:SELECT_A_CATEGORY_LBL#""/&gt;  Incident Custom Fields  If the field(s) are custom fields included on the Ask a Question page along with the question, you can edit the configuration for that specific incident custom field and enable the Required check box so that the field is required on the Ask a Question page.  Contact Custom Fields  If the field(s) is requested when the end-user creates a new account from the end-user interface, the field is a contact custom field."

Purging the database of old incidents or answers;Answer ID 781;What options are there for purging the database of old incidents or answers?;['Answer ID 1234'];   Purge incidents, Delete answers  Issue   I would like to purge our database of all public answers and incidents for all interfaces. How can I accomplish this without deleting the incidents one at a time?;"  There are several options to purge your database of old incidents or answers. To delete records from your site, such as incidents or answers, your staff profile must have the Delete option enabled for the record type. For example, to delete incidents, your staff profile must have the Delete option enabled on the Service tab for incidents. You can archive older incidents instead of deleting them so that if you need to reference them in a read-only format at a later time, you can. For more information on archiving incidents, refer to Answer ID 1234: Options for removing older incidents without deleting them from our site.  Deleting Solved Incidents  Important! Once the incidents have been purged, edit the PURGE_DELETE_INCIDENTS setting to be zero so that your new incidents are not deleted. The best way to purge old, solved incidents prior to the 18B release Â is by using the PURGE_DELETE_INCIDENTS  Â configuration setting. This setting specifies the number of days after which Solved incidents will be deleted. Beginning with the 18B release, incident purging can be configured and enabled via Â Data Lifecycle Policies in the Agent Browser UI. Because of this the PURGE_DELETE_INCIDENTS configuration has been removed. Note: Incidents assigned to custom status levels where the custom status type is Solved are also purged from the database. If you set the PURGE_DELETE_INCIDENTS setting to 0, incidents will not be deleted automatically. If you set this setting to be 1 day, you can remove virtually all Solved incidents from your database the next time agedatabase runs -- usually once per day.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.   Deleting Unresolved Incidents  Important! Use extreme caution when deleting batches of incidents. Once the incidents are deleted from the database, they are removed completely and this action cannot be reversed. Note that you can also use this method to delete groups of solved incidents if you have a specific group of incidents you wish to delete.

Methodology behind the answer score value;Answer ID 790;What is the methodology behind the score value that is calculated for answers? I understand that it is not a simple helpful / not helpful increment.;['Answer ID 5874'];   Answers, Score, End-user pages Oracle B2C Service;"  The Solved Count feature collects information about the usefulness of answers in your knowledge base and uses this data to rank your answers. Implicit data is compiled by how customers select and view answers. Explicit data is compiled by how customers rate the effectiveness of individual answers. Both long-term and short-term solved counts are used to calculate the score. Solved counts from the customer portal account for 75 percent of an answer's score, and agent solved counts for 25 percent. Using the solved count values, Â Oracle B2C Service can dynamically rank the answers by their usefulness and present customers with the most effective answers first. By default the Solved Count feature is enabled. An answer's score value is a calculated value equal to the answer's solved count combined with any ""fix at"" positions specified for the answer in the Display Position drop-down menu when adding or editing an answer. For more information about the options available, refer to Adding Answer Details. The answer score takes into account how well the answer satisfied the end-user. It also takes into account any additional searching performed by the contact after viewing the Answer. Depending on the actual usage by the end-user, the score may increase by a few points or may even decrease.  Implicit Ratings Â - Implicit ratings are gathered as customers view answers. If a customer views an answer, the solved count of the first answer is increased, but not as much as the second viewed answer. In other words, the answer that the customer views last receives the largest solved count increase. Previously viewed answers receive a smaller increase in their solved counts. The solved count is also increased when an agent uses a SmartAssistant suggested answer when responding to a customer's question. Explicit Ratings - Explicit ratings are gathered from the response to the question, ""Was this answer helpful?"". This question is displayed on the Answers page on the customer portal.  In addition, if the answer is not viewed frequently, its score may be reduced automatically by the system. The SA_AGE_FREQ  Â configuration setting specifies the aggressiveness of the SmartAssistant data aging process. The value corresponds to the approximate number of days for an unused Answer to have its solved count and link strengths reduced to zero. Maximum value is 400. A value of 0 disables aging. Default is 200.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key."

Incident created without the required fields being filled out;Answer ID 809;Every now and then an incident will come in and the required fields are not set. How can this happen?;['Answer ID 780'];   Customer Portal, Incident submission;  There are ways for incidents to be submitted without required fields being completed. How this occurs depends on the source for the incident. For example, if the incident source is something other than the Ask a Question page, the submittal process may not provide a means for the contact to set the required field(s). To determine the source of the incident, click the Details tab and the Source field is listed on the tab. Incidents Submitted via Ask a Question: Â In some versions it is possible to submit and incident via the Ask a Question page wiht JavaScript disabled. If an end-user has JavaScript disabled in their browser, incidents can be submitted through the Ask a Question page without having required Products and Categories selected. The Products and Categories menus require JavaScript to be enabled. In rare cases, an end-user may disable JavaScript in their browser configuration, and as a result, incidents can be submitted without the product or category value set. Incidents Created from Source Other than Ask a Question: If the incident source is something other than the Ask a Question page, the submittal process may not provide a means for the contact to set the required field(s). For example, incidents created from an email or by submitting answer feedback or site feedback do not require the user to provide product, category, or custom field information. Similarly, incidents submitted as a response to a mailing do not have required fields set. In fact, incidents submitted from these sources do not even include a way for the user to set those fields. As, a result, incidents created from these sources are blank for the required fields. Required fields only apply to the Ask a Question page and for incidents created from the administrative console. It is possible to set the custom fields for other incident sources by using business rules. For incidents where the incident source is email, answer feedback, site feedback, or mailing response you can configure rules to set the required fields to a specific value. Note: For information on making fields required with incidents submitted from the Ask a Question page, refer to Answer ID 780: Requiring certain Fields with Submitted Incidents.

One of the resulting answers does not contain the string ""customer waiting"". It contains the word ""wait"" so it's not expected in the results of an ""exact phrase"" search.";" When using the exact phrase search technique, answers with the same pattern of words are matched and displayed to the user. The pattern in the returned answers may be different from the search text in the sense that the returned documents will have the same sequence of stemmed words but these stemmed words may be separated by one or more stop words. Exact search is the only supported search technique which does not support the logical operators. This means that when searching on the phrase ""customer waiting"", all answers that have a stemmed form of ""customer"" preceding a stemmed form of ""wait"" will be included in the search results, even if the stemmed words are not next to one another and separated by stop words such as ""are"" or ""and"". If the phrase ""exact search"" is confusing to your staff and end-users, consider changing the message base or filter option label for this type of searching to indicate its function differently. For example, you could rename the Exact Phrase searching to be AND KEYWORDS. Customer Portal: Search Type field options are generally controlled by the filter options included within the report being used. Â  To change the options text, locate the report being used in the widget. Â  Edit Â the Â label(s) for the filters as needed within that report.

Email Gateway error for an Invalid Mail Server Password;Answer ID 823;I have an Email Gateway error that says Invalid Mail Server Password.;['Answer ID 1853'];   Email, Mailbox;  A persistent Email Gateway error that says Invalid Mail Server Password means that the information in the password field of the support mailbox configured in the Mailboxes table of Oracle B2C Service does not match the actual password information for that account. When the error occurs due to a password failure the error messages will continue until the password is fixed. Â  Â However, intermittent or self correcting errors of this type can typically be ignored. In the event that intermittent errors occurr with frequency, additional investigation may be required. Note: Errors are reported in the Error Log. If your staff profile has the System Error Log box enabled on the Administration tab, you will receive error notifications in your Communication Center. For more information on the Â Error Log, refer to Answer ID 1853: Error Log and System Error notifications.    If your POP3 account password has recently been changed, update the entry in the mailboxes table in Oracle B2C Service to match. Then techmail should once again be able to log into the mailbox and process messages without difficulty. If you reset the password on both the POP account and in the Mailboxes table and you still get the 'Invalid Mail Server Password' error message, try verifying the login by another method. You can do this with a standard telnet client using the steps below:  From the Start menu on your computer, select Run... In the Open text field, enter: telnet IP_Address_or_Domain_Name:110 and click OK. This launches a telnet session, and connects to your mail server via port 110, which is the POP protocol port. Enter: user [mailbox_username] and click Enter. Enter: pass [mailbox_password] and click Enter.  If the login is successful, you have the right username and password for the mailbox. You may want to reset these settings in the Mailboxes tables one more time. If the login is unsuccessful, the information you have about the password is incorrect. Basically, for Oracle B2C Service to connect to a mailbox, the following items must be true:  The mail server, account and password settings in the Mailboxes table must match the settings for the actual mailbox account. The mailbox must be POP3 compliant (not IMAP). If there is a firewall between the Web server and the mail server, the firewall must allow access to the mailbox from the IP address of the Web server.  If the above conditions are true, there may be an issue with the basic configuration of the POP mailbox itself. Is the mailbox on the same mail server as another mailbox that is working within Oracle B2C Service? If so, consider creating a new mailbox and using it instead. If not, establish a new mailbox on the same mail server, change the settings in Oracle B2C Service and see if you are able to access that mailbox.

Using the pipe ( | ) and spaces with regular expressions;Answer ID 835;"When configuring a regular expression that uses the pipe feature ( | ) for an ""or"" statement, should I include a space between the text and the pipe?";['Answer ID 861'];   Business Rules using Regular Expressions Oracle B2C Service;"  In general, you should not include a space between the text and the pipe. Including a space in this type of regular expression will limit when the regular expression is matched and in this case, the space becomes part of the regular expression to be matched. For example, if you create a workflow rule that includes a regular expression for ""cap | hat"" in the Summary field, where there are spaces included on either side of the pipe, the rule will match only if there is a space after the cap sequence OR if there is a space before the hat sequence. However, there are cases where you might want to include a space as part of the regular expression -- specifically when defining a specific word to be matched. For more information on matching a specific word, refer to Answer ID 861: Records Matching Incorrect Regular Expressions. Additionally, it's also important to understand the 'Regular Expression' operator evaluates the raw data/text that is input into the database."

Rule is matching an incorrect expression;Answer ID 861;Why is the wrong business rule getting applied to an incident?;['Answer ID 1873', 'Answer ID 486', 'Answer ID 2851'];   Business Rules  Issue   I have workflow rules and escalation rules configured for our site.Ã‚Â When I check the rule log, I realize that the wrong rule was applied. Why is this happening?;"  When you have configured workflow and escalation rules using regular expressions, it sometimes appears that an incorrect rule was applied to a record when the underlying cause is that the regular expression is not set up correctly. To determine why the record matched a rule, carefully review the regular expression involved. You can use the Rule Log to determine which rules matched and acted on your incidents. For more information on using the Rule Log, refer to Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log to Troubleshoot Rules.  Â   Incorrect Use of Asterisks (*)  It is a somewhat common error when configuring regular expressions to use the asterisk (*) as a wildcard in the regular expression (as you might if you were to search on a word or part of a word). This is an incorrect configuration for regular expressions. With regular expressions, the asterisk (*) means that the preceding character is matched zero or more times, which basically means that the preceding character becomes optional. For this reason, the incident may indeed match a rule that is configured with an asterisk for a regular expression. For example, if you create a rule to match the regular expression, hat* in the Summary field, you are basically saying that the rule should match if any word in the Summary contains the character sequence ""ha"" (since the letter ""t"" is optional due to the *). All of the examples listed below would match:  Do you like my new Â hats? Do you like my new haircut? What do you like to eat? Are my chances good?  If a rule acts on an incident in an unexpected manner, check that the regular expression defined in the rule is expressing your intent correctly. If you have used the asterisk (*) as a wildcard, remove it from the regular expression and save the rule and reactivate rulebase.  Â   Text String Matches Longer Word  When words are entered in a regular expression, you are defining a text string that is matched, not a specific word. That is, regular expressions match the text string you define, regardless if the string is within a longer word or is a word itself. Â  NOTE: The 'Regular Expression' operator evaluates the raw data/text that is input into the database. For example, you can define a regular expression that includes ""fresh"" as an element without spaces before or after the word, such as: word1|fresh|word2 This expression would match the word ""refreshment"" as well as the specific word you indicated (fresh). This is because the word ""fresh"" is contained within the longer word. Therefore, incidents may match a rule if the incident contains a longer version of a word that incorporates one of the text strings defined in the regular expression. Review your expression carefully along with the content of your record to determine if that text string is included within the record.  Â  To include a specific word of interest in your expressions, you can include three components in the IF statement for the customer thread: ...| fresh | fresh\.|^fresh |... The first component handles cases where the word ""fresh"" exists in a sentence and is surrounded by spaces. The second addresses ""fresh"" at the end of a sentence where the word is preceded by a space and followed by a period and the third option addresses the word at the beginning of a line. Note: You may need to add additional components to address specific punctuation or cases how the word is used within the customer thread of an incident. Similarly, if the IF statement involves the incident subject, you could use additional components to address the word at the beginning or end of the line: ...| fresh | fresh$|^fresh |... In this situation, the first component still addresses the word itself surrounded by spaces. The second component indicates that the word is at the end of a line and the third component is for words at the beginning of the line.  Â  For more information on using regular expressions, refer to Answer ID 486: Using Regular Expressions Â and Answer ID 2851: Regular expression is part of another word."

Response appended by a rule is not sent in the email;Answer ID 880;Why do customers still get the same response even though a ruleÃ‚Â has been set upÃ‚Â that automatically emails a specific response under certain criteria?;['Answer ID 5810'];   Business Rules;"  Since you want to include the response in the email that gets sent to the customer, you must add an additional, specific action in the rule that sends a response to the incident to your end-user. It is not enough to just append the standard response to the incident; you must also send the Response email to the end-user. Click Add Action Â and select Email &gt; Send Email Response to Sender. Note: If an agent sends a response, one message will be sent that contains both the agent response and the rule auto-response. For example, if agent Smith sends a response and closes an incident, and there is a rule to send a response when any incident is closed, the Incident Solved message template is used. Both the agent response and the rule response will be included in the message. Also note that if the Incident Solved message template is disabled, no response will be sent out, as the Incident Solved message template takes precedence over the Rule Email message template. For further information on enabling the ""Rule Email"", see the following answer: Answer ID 5810: Rule Email not sent."

Requiring customers to log in to end-user pages;Answer ID 881;How can I require our customers to register and log in before they go to any part of our end-user pages?;['Answer ID 5810'];   Customer Portal,Ã‚Â Enduser pages;"  You can configure your end-user pages to be password-protected so that visitors MUST log in to access any part of the end-user interface. To password-protect the CP end-user pages, you must edit the meta tags of the Â end-user files to include the login_required=Ã¢â‚¬ÂtrueÃ¢â‚¬Â attribute. The path to these files is: /euf/development/views/pages/  ./error.php ./home.php ./answers/detail.php ./answers/hier_popup.php ./answers/list.php ./answers/print.php ./utils/email_link.php ./utils/help_search.php ./utils/live.php  Note: Â  In the utils directory, leave the login_form.php file without the login_required=""true"" attribute. This allows users the ability to access the login page. In addition, if you allow accounts to be created from the end-user interface, the create_account.php file in the utils folder should also not include the login_required=""true"" attribute so that new users can access the page to create their new account. Files requiring login: Â  By default, the files in the following directories are password protected and include the login_required=""true"" attribute in the meta tag:  ask.php ask_confirm.php utils/sla_required.php utils/submit (password_changed.php and profile_updated.php all files in the account folder (including files in the questions and notif sub-folders)  Additionally, if the CP_CONTACT_LOGIN_REQUIRED configuration setting is enabled, then those page where the login_required attribute is not set become protected and a user needs to login. Â  Â In addition, any files that are attached to answers are also protected and if the URL to an attachment is forwarded to another user, that user must log in to view the attachment. So, while you can use login_required to explicitly state which pages require a login or not, if you want the answers to require a login, you should also enable CP_CONTACT_LOGIN_REQUIRED. Note that when you change the value of CP_CONTACT_LOGIN_REQUIRED, it only affects the development pages. Â  Â You must do a deploy to production for the configuration value to affect your production pages.  Additional Considerations  Pass-through authentication: Some sites include a login feature independently of Oracle B2C Service -- that is, visitors to the site must log in anyway -- even to access non-Oracle B2C Service Â pages. In these cases, you probably do not want your site visitors to have to log in to your Web site and then log in again to your Oracle B2C Service application. It is possible to configure Oracle B2C Service to pass through the initial login information so that your customers only have to log in one time. To include this pass through login functionality to your Oracle B2C Service site, you must purchase Pass Through Authentication (PTA). For more information on pricing and options, please contact your sales account manager."

Adding words to an answer to be pulled up with a search;Answer ID 889;How can I add words to an answer so that it is more likely to be pulled up with a search?;['Answer ID 1301', 'Answer ID 1995'];   Answer, Keywords Oracle B2C Service;  You may want to add words to a public answer so that the answer is more likely to be pulled up in the results of a specific search. When creating or editing an answer, the Keywords field allows you to explicitly state keywords and phrases related to the content of the answer. This field is not viewable by end-users. You can enter supplemental keywords, phrases, acronyms, or text that represent the answerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contents. This field is indexed in the same process as the Summary, Question, and Answer fields. Words and phrases must be separated by commas in the list. Important Note: When adding keywords and phrases to an answer, multiple entries MUST be separated by commas. Failure to include items in a comma-separated list could result in improper search results and performance issues. The Keywords field is listed beneath the Summary field. For more information on keywords, refer to Answer ID 1301: Keywords Field when Editing Answers. Aliases: You can also use the aliases.txt file to create a list of synonyms to be used for searching your entire set of answers. That way, you don't have to copy the same set of keywords into several answers. Instead, you can define the common list of business-specific synonyms to be used with all answer searches. For more information on using the aliases.txt file, refer to Answer ID 1995: Using a list of common aliases and keywords for all answers.

Search By results using complex expressions are inconsistent;Answer ID 897;"How can IÃ‚Â find all answers that contain BOTH ""cat"" and ""dog""?";['Answer ID 2049'];   Analytics, Phrase Searching Oracle B2C Service;"  Using complex expressions Â the following results for the searches performed: cat= 43 incidents found cat + dog = 57 incidents found dog + cat = 43 incidents found dog = 57 incidents found  OR Searching: By default, multiple words in a search are joined with an OR connector. As a result, Â searching with COMPLEX EXPRESSIONS and multiple words are entered in the search field, any word without a plus sign in front of it is optional. As a result, in the two cases that use complex expressions, ""cat + dog"" and ""dog + cat"", the results are consistent with the functionality. For the case of cat + dog, only ""dog"" is required, this means that the incident will match if it includes dog alone OR it also contains cat. This is the same as saying it will match if it matches dog alone. That is searching for ""dog"" and ""cat + dog"" will give the same results. Similarly, for dog + cat, the incident matches if it contains cat alone OR it also contains dog. If you want to search for incidents that contain both cat and dog, you must include a plus sign in front of both words: ""+cat +dog"" or ""+dog +cat"". AND Searching: If you have changed the search configuration to use an AND connector between multiple words, then records are returned Â only if the record includes all words listed in the search term. In this case, it is not necessary to include the ""+"" before specific words. For more information on AND and OR searching, refer to Using an AND join with keyword searching."

Transaction fields in custom reports;Answer ID 906;When configuring a custom report, what are the fields that I can add from the transactions table?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2611'];   Analytics, Transaction fields Oracle B2C Service;"  The transaction fields available when configuring a custom report correspond to the information listed when you Â view the Audit Log of a record. Â  For example, when viewing the audit log for an incident, the transactions include the actions Incident Assigned to, Incident Forwarded, or Response Sent to. The Audit Log / Transactions are the Â history of Â actions associated with a particular record. This includes saving a record, reassigning a record or in the case of incidents sending a response. Â  Each transaction includes the date and time, the type of transaction and who performed the action. Note: Â The ma_trans table includes transactions associated with outbound mailings from the Outreach module. When adding this field to a custom report, it is listed as the Marketing Activities table Â in the Data Dictionary section when you right click to select a table.  Table and Field Descriptions  Descriptions of the fields and values included in the transaction table are listed in our online documentation (see Transactions Table). To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Â  For information on accessing the data dictionary, see Â Answer ID 2611: Accessing the data dictionary.  Â  Â  Â   Custom Reporting  Transaction fields allow you considerable flexibility in defining custom reports. To become familiar with the transaction fields and their values, consider generating a simple report that lists the various fields. Refer to Â Custom Reports Â section in online documentation for assistance. Note: If you need assistance with creating a specific custom report for your business needs, consultants on our Oracle Consulting team are able to help. For more information on pricing and options, please contact your sales account manager. From a basic report, you can begin experimenting with adding additional transaction fields as selection criteria or even incident fields as either search criteria or report output. By keeping the Transaction - Created Â filter to a small date and time range (such as a few hours), you can generally keep the number of Â records to a comparatively small number to ensure that the custom report is working properly. Example: Â  You can create a simple report for incidents created in a specific timeframe or for transactions created in a specific time period such as the previous day or previous hour. Â  This example will create a transactions report for incidents. By including a run-time filter for the transactions date created field, you can control the amount of data returned with this report.  Data Set / Table Instances Add the Incidents table and join the Transactions table  Run-time Selectable Filters Name: trans (or whatever you want to name it) Expression: Transactions &gt; Date Created Operator: between Value: define a specific range or a relative date range for a single hour or a single day.

Preventing spam / junk email from becoming incidents;Answer ID 908;What can be done to stop SPAM email from becoming incidents?;['Answer ID 2345'];   Mailboxes, SPAM Filtering, Business Rules, All versions;"  Generally, bulk mail messages (spam) are automatically removed by the techmail utility, which checks to see if the originating mail server is the type commonly used for sending out mass mailings. The odds are good that many messages of this type are already being removed before they come into your Oracle B2C Service application.  External Spam Filtering  The best way to avoid receiving spam email is to use a dedicated spam filtering tool. Barracuda spam filtering is provided for mailboxes that Â are hosted by Oracle B2C Service. You can configure spam filtering for each of your hosted mailboxes. For more information, refer to Â  Answer ID 2345: Barracuda Spam filters on hosted Service mailboxes. If you are using a mailbox that is not hosted by Oracle B2C Service, it is strongly recommended that you use an external spam filtering utility. This will not only reduce the amount of unwanted email that you will receive, but also the chance that a mal-formatted spam message will disrupt the processing of valid email.  Discard Fields for Mailboxes  Within your Oracle B2C Service application, each mailbox has discard fields which allow you to filter email based on content. You can add Â specific email addresses to your list of Discard Addresses. Incoming email from addresses included in the Discard Addresses field are deleted before they become incidents and before a contact record is created. Consistently adding offending email addresses can prevent repetitive abuses by an individual. Note: The list of discard addresses is separated by commas without spaces. Similarly, you can update the Discard Subject or Discard Body field of your mailbox configuration with the phrase you want to match. Enter any text found in an email subject line that identifies an email as one to be discarded. Each entry should be on a separate line. For example: Mortgage rates Marketing solution Bargain alert  Note: Emails are discarded based on whether the content matches any of the text strings entered and function similar to regular expressions in business rules. That is, if you include the entry ""hat"" as criteria to discard the email, emails will be discarded if they include words that have ""hat"" in them, including, ""chat"", ""what"", ""hatch"" and so on. For this reason, it is best to include longer words or phrases when adding content to these discard fields. To modify any of the discard fields, use the steps below:  In May 2010 and later: Â Go to Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes   In May 2010 and earlier: Â  From the Service Configuration Items, select Communication Configuration &gt; Service Mailboxes. Â    In the left-hand frame, right-click on the mailbox name and select Edit. In the right-hand frame, click the Incoming Email tab. With the Filter menu set to Discard Addresses or Discard Subject and add content to the field as appropriate. Click Update.   Â  Auto-responder  Auto-responder can filter emails that are created using regular expression matches. You can search for matches either in the header or body of incoming emails. Â  The auto-responder Â filter is controlled by configuration settings: Â  Conservative - EGW_AR_CONS_BODY_FLTR and Â EGW_AR_CONS_HEAD_FLTR Moderate - EGW_AR_MODR_BODY_FLTR and Â EGW_AR_MODR_HEAD_FLTR Aggressive - EGW_AR_AGGR_BODY_FLTR Â and Â EGW_AR_AGGR_HEAD_FLTR   These settings take Â POSIX-extended regular expressions (one per line) with a leading and trailing '/'. Changes made to the conservative filter will be read in to more aggressive filters so you do not have to make additional modifications to mailboxes using more aggressive filters. Please note these configurations are interface specific. You can make any modifications you would like here but you should use Â caution, the use of a regex in this way is very powerful so we always recommend testing on a test site prior to implementing in production so that you do not pick up false positives. We also suggest watching the entries in the 'Incoming Email Filter Details' (ac_id 227) report in the subsequent days after making changes to confirm that you are not filtering any unexpected items.        Configure a Rule to Manage Emails  If spam and content filtering is not enough to block all unwanted messages, Â you can set up a rule within Oracle B2C Service to look for a specific keyword(s) in the email and either:  NOT create an incident if those words are included in the message, or create an incident but notify or assign it to someone who can review it for this type of content.  Important! Â Using rules in this manner is not foolproof -- messages may not match the rule specified, and there is a chance that the rule may act upon messages which contain the keyword(s) but are not actually spam. The most common method for setting up this type of rule is to use regular expressions and the pipe ( | ) feature. The pipe is used to specify a series of words or phrases that you are interested in matching. The pipe acts as an OR Â operator between each item separated by the pipe character. For example, to set up a condition that matches the rule if the subject of an email contains ""cat"" or ""dog"", you can set up the criteria in the ""if"" section of the rule as listed below: Incident.Summary matches regular expression cat|dog  You can then add additional criteria or specify actions to complete the configuration of your rule. Once your rule is configured, be sure to test the rule by submitting test incidents to your site. Submit Â several incidents that will match the rule to verify that it will match the incidents you want it to. Also submit at least one incident that should not match to verify that it will not affect incidents that it shouldn't."

Filtering emails based on partial email addresses;Answer ID 910;Is there a way to filter out partial email addresses so that incidents are not created from such addresses?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Incoming E-mails Oracle B2C Service;"  You can add the desired partial email addresses along with wildcards to the Discard Addresses field for the mailboxes configured in the Mailboxes table. For instance, to eliminate all email messages from an address including ""admin"", add *admin* to the Discard Address field of the mailbox. Another example would be admin* which would delete any email that started with the phrase ""admin"". To enter multiple items, separate each element with a comma and do not include spaces in the list. For example: email1@domain.com,email2@domain.com,email3@domain.com Â   To edit the mailbox configuration, use the steps below:  Go to Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Â Mailboxes.   In the left-hand frame, right click on the mailbox and select Edit.   Click the Incoming E-mail tab from ribbon.   Under Discard Filters &gt; Addresses text field, Â add the email address or partial email address (with a wildcard). For example, admin* or *admin*.   Click Save.   Repeat for additional mailboxes as necessary.

Incident Trend reports for Closed and Responded incidents differ greatly;Answer ID 924;Why don't results match between the Incident Trend report and the Incident Trend - Closed report?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics  Issue   I checked the Incident Trend Report (ID 85) to see how many incidents we had solved so far today and the Incident Trend - Closed report showed zero incidents and would not allow me to drill down. Since we change our status directly to Solved when sending out an email, I checked the Incident Trend - Responded report. The report showed 139 incidents.Ã‚Â We expect results between these reports to match.;  The Incident Trend - Closed report (ID 10) uses cached data from the stats table which is stored by the agedatabase utility run each night. Therefore, statistics for today's incidents will be displayed on the graph tomorrow, after the utility has had a chance to run and collect that information. In general, the Incident Trend - Closed report lists the number of incidents that have been set to a solved status type for the time interval specified, either manually or as the result of agedatabase changing a waiting incident to solved. The Incident Trend - Responded report (ID 9) gives the number of incidents that were responded to during the time interval, regardless of what status they were assigned to when the response was sent.

Incident assignment based on staff updates;Answer ID 930;When I open the incident, it is still assigned to the original staff member (not the one who updated the incident). Is this supposed to work this way?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Incident workspace, Responses;" How incidents are reassigned upon editing depends on whether the incident was already assigned to another staff member and whether a response to the incident is sent.  Case 1: Staff member updates an incident that is assigned to Â another staff member and does not send a response  Â  If a staff member updates an incident that is assigned to another staff member (without sending a response to the contact), the incident remains assigned to the original staff member. With this design, non-assigned staff members can add information to the incident, i.e. to a notes field, for example, without changing the assignment.  Case 2: Staff member sends a response to an incident that was assigned Â to another staff member  Â  Whether incidents are reassigned when another staff member responds to the incident is controlled by a property in the incident workspace used by the staff member. Within the incident workspace, the Reassign the Incident When Send On Save is Selected property for the Incident Thread relationship item specifies whether an incident is reassigned when a response is sent for an incident. To Â access this property you must click within the incident thread and then from the Design tab, select Response Options &gt; Reassign the Incident When Send On Save is Selected. The options for the property are: No Change -- Â The incident's Assigned field does not change.  Â  To Current Agent -- The Assigned field changes to the staff member working the incident. Â   Â  To Unassigned -- The Assigned field is set to No Value. Note: This property can be set differently for different workspaces, so the functionality may be different depending on the staff member and the workspace assigned to them.  Case 3: Staff member updates an incident that is not assigned to anyone  Â  If a staff member updates an incident that is unassigned (without sending a response), the incident remains unassigned. As in case 2 above, whether an incident is reassigned when a response is sent depends on how the Reassign the Incident When Send On Save is Selected property for the Incident Thread relationship item is configured within the incident workspace."

Improving SmartAssistant to suggest more useful answers;Answer ID 936;What can I do to make the SmartAssistant Suggested SolutionsÂ more useful?;['Answer ID 1771'];   SmartAssistant, All versions;"  The tips provided in this answer are useful for the SmartAssistant Suggested Solutions feature when responding to an incident or appending SmartAssistant solutions to a response with a workflow rule. Regarding the SmartAssistant Suggested Solutions functionality, keep in mind that when reading an incident, Â a human Â can tell which words are important by the overall content of the question. Oracle B2C Service and SmartAssistant cannot do this. There is no means for the application to determine which words are most important in the incident based on the context involved. SmartAssistant looks at all the words in the customer entry thread of the incident and does not evaluate contents in the response or notes threads. Then, SmartAssistant excludes words listed in the exclude_answers.txt file. Remaining words and words with the same word stem are included in the process for suggested solution. Similarly, words listed as aliases in the aliases.txt are also considered a match. By default, words appearing in the Summary field are more important than those in the Description field. In addition, the frequency of the word (or words) in the Summary and Description fields are also taken into account when looking for the best suggested solutions.  Evaluate Configuration Settings  Several configuration settings affect the SmartAssistant suggestion solutions feature. Â You can configure the specific weighting factors associated with words included in specific answer fields. In addition, suggested solutions rely heavily on answers located within answer clusters. Clusters are logical groupings of answers based on similar text, products, categories and answer relationships determined by end-user activity and linking from one answer to another within the same customer session. The SmartAssistant functionality determines the best answer cluster or clusters that match the search terms and then determines the best answers to suggest from within the cluster(s). Review the options and settings listed below to affect how SmartAssistant determines suggested solutions:          Modify SmartAssistant Relevancy: Two configuration settings let you control how an incident's subject and body are treated to influence the way answers are returned to SmartAssistant. The value for SA_SUBJ_BODY_WEIGHTS includes three values: one for the weight of the incident subject text, one for the weight for the incident body text, and one for the bonus when both subject and body text are matched.   The SA_DISPATCH_RATIO value includes two values to define whether answers are returned based on the hybrid mode used by SA_SUBJ_BODY_WEIGHTS or on the standard SmartAssistant mode. The default value ""100 0"" mean that they will always be returned by the first mode, while ""0 100"" means they will always be returned by the standard mode.   The two values do not have to add up to 100. Instead they represent the odds that the first or second mode will be chosen. For example, ""50 20"" means that for every 70 requests, the first mode will be chosen 50 times, and the standard mode will be chosen 20.   Note: These configuration settings are also used to identify similar answers for the Smart Merge feature.             Increase or Decrease Weighting Factor for Answer Fields: Â You can customize the weighting used with words and phrases for the various text fields of an answer. This allows you to increase or decrease the weighting factor for specific types of answer fields, including the Keywords, Products, Categories, and Question and Answer fields For more information on modifying the search weights, refer to Answer ID 1771: Changing Search Weights in Answers.             Recluster your Answers: Answers are clustered automatically based on the amount of edits made to answers. Â You can schedule your answers to be reclustered the next time agedatabase runs.   Configuration menu &gt; Service &gt; Knowledge Base &gt; Â Topic Browse. Enable the Schedule cluster regeneration Â checkbox and click Save.           Modify the Match Threshold for the Clusters: The SA_NL_MATCH_THRESHOLD configuration setting specifies the ability to restrict SmartAssistant suggested answers to answers that have the same or nearby clusters in the browse tree. Default is 1. The accepted values are: 0 - do not restrict, 1 - use answers from any closely matching cluster and sub-clusters thereof, and 2 - use only best matching clusters. If SA_DM_FREQ is set to 0, the value of SA_NL_MATCH_THRESHOLD will be forced to 0 regardless of the value displayed here.   Note: In later versions the SA_NL_MATCH_THRESHOLD (visible) and SA_DM_FREQ (hidden) Â are Â configuration settings. Â Submit a service request Â to Â Ask Technical Support for help editing this hidden Â configuration setting, SA_DM_FREQ. Customers have visibility into SA_NL_MATCH_THRESHOLD.    Since the default for this setting is 1, you can minimize the impact of the answer clusters by setting this option to 0. By setting this value to 0, the suggested answers will more closely match what would be returned with a normal answer phrase search. Â           Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.   Note: SmartAssistant will never behave exactly like a text search performed on the Answers tab because SmartAssistant uses different search procedures associated with clustering and weighting that standard searching uses.           Change the Restriction for Product or Category Matching with the Incident: The SA_SUGGEST_LIMIT_PROD_LVL and SA_SUGGEST_LIMIT_CAT_LVL configuration settings specify whether the suggested answers must match the product or category values of the submitted incidents and to how many levels deep. For example, if the value for SA_SUGGEST_LIMIT_CAT_LVL is set to 2, then the answers that are suggested must match the incident's category and sub-category values.    Set these settings to be 0 so that SmartAssistant is not restricted by the product and category values used in the incident and set in the answers.     Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.          Enable Clustering Settings Â Enable the CLUST_ENABLED so that answers will automatically be clustered periodically.     Writing Answer Content  If you find that suggested answers do not seem to match the incident as well as you would like, there are some things you can do when writing your published answers. Keep in mind that the SmartAssistant Suggested Solutions are heavily influenced by the way the END-USER writes their request for assistance, that is, the specific terminology and phrases used in the submitted incident. For this reason, you can only do so much when writing your public answers. The items below, though, are worth considering:  Unique Words in Summary Field: Include key words that make the answer unique in the Summary field so that word will be weighted more heavily.   Limit Frequently Used Words in Summary: Avoid words in the Summary that appear in most of the public answers. For example, if your company sells cameras, avoid using ""camera"" in the Summary of most of your answers.   Use End-User Phrases: Try to use phrases that your end-users use. Matching a phrase is more likely to result in favorable suggested solutions, since not only are two individual words matching, but the two words together are also taken into account.   Avoid Repeating Familiar Words: Avoid repeating frequently used words within a single answer. Each time a word is used it will carry more weight.   Use the Keywords Field: Add other keywords and phrases to your answers by adding additional words and phrases to the Keywords field. Use a comma to separate each word and phrase listed.   Edit Summary of Submitted Incidents: Have your staff members edit the Summary field to pick more appropriate keywords than the end-user did and then save the incident. When the staff member re-opens the incident, the suggested solutions will take into account the contents of the edited Summary field.   Break Common Phrases: If several answers include a similar two- or three-word phrase, consider excluding one of the words so that the commonly used multi-word phrase does not get extra weight. For example, if you have a product named Wonderful Widget, consider adding either word to the exclude_answers.txt file so that the product name is not inadvertently weighted higher due to the two-word phrase.  To demonstrate how the SmartAssistant Suggested Solutions work, create a test incident with a single, unique word in the Subject and Description. Then open the incident from the administration side and click Suggestions From the suggested results, you should see that the answers returned do indeed include the word in the test incident. When more and more words are added to a submitted incident, it is not as easy to relate public answers to all of the significant words in the incident. For this reason, it appears that the suggested solutions may not be as relevant as you might like them to be."

If the expression uses and AND join between filters and you expect it to use an OR join between filters, several records will be excluded from your report. From Â the Home tab and the Data Set group, Â click the Filters button and review the logical expression.  Â  For more information on editing the logical expression, refer to Answer ID 1041: Using the Logical Expression feature in reports. Join Type Between Tables: By default, tables are joined using an inner join between the tables. This means that the record must be referenced in both tables. For example, if a report uses tables where the incident and staff accounts tables are joined with an inner join, only incidents that are assigned to a staff member are included in the report. Incidents that are not assigned are not referenced in the staff accounts table so those records would be excluded from the report. Review Â the Â data set for the report Â and determine which join type you need between the tables of your report. For more information on join types, refer to Answer ID 1839: Types of Table Joins Used with Reports and Views. Text Searches with the LIKE Operator: When creating custom reports, the LIKE operator is designed to match the contents of the Value field exactly. Therefore, you will generally want to include wild cards when searching, i.e. the percent character (%), around the specific word or phrase of interest. When configuring filters for a report, the Complex Expression operator includes a trailing wildcard in the search. However, if you need to include a preceding wildcard, then you need to include the trailing wildcard as Â well. For example, when using the complex expression operator with an incident summary, %error% returns all records that contain error. Using 'error' returns records that begin with ""error"" because a trailing wildcard is assumed. By including the % symbol, the report criteria is functionally equivalent to ""CONTAINS text error"". Data-type Fields: Â When working with reports, if you include a date-type field as a run-time selectable filter, be sure to set the operator to ""between"". This allows you to specify a date range for the value of the field. If the operator for a date field is set to ""equals"", then the date associated with the record must match the date and time exactly (to the second) in order for the record to match the report criteria. For example, if you include the incidents.created field as a run-time filter, if the filter is set to be ""incidents.created=05/04/16 12:00 AM"", an incident would have to be created exactly at midnight on 5/04/16 to be included in the report. It is most common to use the ""between"" operator with date type fields. You can also use the open-ended options including, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, or &gt;= as well."

Create an interface;Answer ID 968;Can I create a new interfaceÃ‚Â on my site?;['Answer ID 7537'];   Interfaces, Site Management Oracle B2C Service;  New interfaces can be created Â using the Oracle Cloud Portal - Configuration Assistant self-service tool. This is done by logging into Oracle Cloud Portal Â and using the Configuration Assistant to create interfaces. Â  Â Please refer to the documentation link below for detailed steps:  Oracle B2C Service Configuration Assistant Documentation   IMPORTANT: Please select the language pack for your new interface carefully. The language pack on an interface cannot be changed. Â  The interface creation process is very complex and can be very time consuming. Â  We are unable to provide the exact time it will take to complete an interface creation as it Â will vary due to many factors that cannot be predetermined. Â  Only one interface can be created at a time. Â  One interface creation must be completed before you can start the creation of another interface. Also note, when there are any update transactions in process on the production site, we are unable to create interfaces, disabled interfaces, rename interfaces or rename site names until all update transactions are completed.

Is it mandatory to define products and categories?;Answer ID 970;Can we limit the search function to key words and phrases without selecting a product and category?;['Answer ID 7537'];Service Products and Categories with Answers; It is not necessary to define products and categories for your application. If you do not specify products or categories, the keyword search functionality is still available. However, we generally recommend using products and/or categories as a way to allow your customers and staff to better filter their search results. Configuring products and categories also allows you to better route your incoming incidents to different staff when using workflow or escalation rules. You might decide to use only one of these fields, Products OR Categories. Though it is frequently quite beneficial to configure products and/or categories for your application, if you decide to not have products and categories, you will not interfere with the basic functionality of Oracle B2C Service. Note In order for an answer to show up (in the search/answer list page) the answer must have at least one product and one category selected with end-user visibility at the lowest level. There is an exception to this, which is if products or categories are not required, it needs to be made sure that they do not have end-user visibility enabled. i.e. If Â 'categories' are not required, end-user visibility for every category will need to be disabled in order for answers with no category to appear within search results. Keep in mind, if you currently have products and categories configured and you delete them from the database, all incidents will be disassociated from the product and category values -- you will not be able to simply restore them by typing them back in. Multiple interfaces: Â  If you use products or categories with published answers for one interface, you must use the feature with all interfaces in your site. Â  However, you can enable a single product or category that is visible to the interface and assign all of the answers to that value. Â  Then, on the end-user pages, configure your site so that the product or category menu does not display.

Severity Levels when submitting a question;Answer ID 971;When submitting a question, what are the levels for the Severity field?;['Answer ID 7537'];   When submitting a service request to Oracle B2C Service Technical Support;"  When service requests (SR) are submitted to Oracle B2C Service Technical Support, you should assign the correct severity level according to impact on your organization's business as a whole. Use the following definitions to assess the actual production site impact of the situation and provide the appropriate severity level when logging a service request with Oracle B2C Service Technical Support. A support representative or manager will confirm that the correct severity level has been assigned based on the information in the SR and details we gather from you on the phone.  Â Be sure to include your phone number for severity 1 and 2 issues so that we can contact you.  Â If we cannot contact you the severity of the ticket may be lowered.    Â Level 1 - Site Down: The customer's production use of the programs is completely stopped or so severely impacted that the organization cannot reasonably continue work. Note: It is important when submitting a Site Down that your production site is completely down and that this is not a means of escalating an incident to be addressed more quickly.   Â Level 2 - Major Functionality Impairment Important program features are unavailable with no acceptable workaround. The customer's implementation or production use of the programs is continuing; however, there is a serious impact on the customer's productivity and/or service levels.   Â Level 3 - Â Some Business Impact: Important program features are unavailable, but a workaround is available, or less significant program features are unavailable with no reasonable workaround. The customer's work, regardless of the environment or product usage, has a minor loss of operational functionality or implementation resources.   Â Level 4 - Â No Business Impact: The customer requests information, an enhancement, or documentation clarification regarding the programs, but there is no impact on the operation of the programs. The customer's implementation or production use of the programs is continuing and there is no work being impeded at the time."

Opening a new browser when viewing attachments or links;Answer ID 973;How do I have a new browser window open when viewing attachments or links?;['Answer ID 7537'];  File Attachments;" Note: Windows accessed from the Oracle B2C Service console Â using the Go, Community and Help windows may take over Â an existing browser instead of opening a new browser. This is Â due to an Internet Explorer setting. Â  Â To Â have new windows Â open for these links, in an IE browser, go to Â  Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced. Â  Â Under the Browser heading, clear the checkbox next to Reuse Windows for Launching Shortcuts.  Links in Answers When viewing answers (or incidents), users always have the option of right-clicking on the link and selecting Open in New Window to open a new browser for the link contents. When linking from one answer to another, you can add the target=""new""  Â attribute when creating a link to another answer. For example, &lt;answer_xref id=""yyy"" target=""new""&gt; creates a link to the Answer ID specified which then opens in a new window. For links within an answer, to open Â a hyperlink in a new window, add 'target=new' when creating the link. For example, the syntax is as follows: &lt;a href=""http://URL_address.com"" target=""new""&gt;Text to display as the link&lt;/a&gt;  Links in Incidents in the Administration Â Consoles Â  Links within incidents Â always open in a new window. In Internet Explorer, this setting can be found by going to Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Browsing &gt; Reuse Windows for Launching Shortcuts. If the Reuse Windows for Launching Shortcuts is not checked, the links will open a new browser window rather than using an open window.  File Attachments on End-User Pages Â  With file attachments that are accessed from the end-user pages (either in an answer or from an incident in the My Â Account - Support History Â area, Â it is possible to configure Oracle B2C Service to open file attachments in a new window when the link is clicked. Â  Â This allows your site visitors Â to retain their original location while viewing the link or attachment. The EU_FA_NEW_WIN_TYPES configuration settings applies to file attachments on the end-user pages. This setting Â allows you to specify a regular expression that is applied to the MIME content type of file attachments. If the content type matches the regular expression in the setting, the file attachment opens in a new window. Generally only files that a browser can open and display, either directly or through a plug-in, should be displayed in a new window. Unfortunately, the specific files a browser can handle varies by browser, operating system, and software installed on the system."

A new incident bypassed the existing rules;Answer ID 980;Why did a new incident bypass the existing workflow rules?;['Answer ID 7537'];  Incident Routing, Business Rules Oracle B2C Service, All versions;" In general, this type of issue arises, not because a rule was by-passed, but instead because the incident matched a rule higher in the list and was then not affected by the rule you expect to take effect. Situations like this most typically occur when either: A new rule is added too high in the list and the incident is affected by the new rule.  Â  A rule that is listed higher in the list is edited so that the new incident is now affected by the edited workflow rule. It is very important when adding or editing rules to consider the rules already configured in your application. By adding or editing rules that are relatively high in the list, you may inadvertently affect the routing of incidents that should match rules lower in the list. To troubleshoot this issue, use the Rule Log to determine which rule(s) affected the incident. From the Â Configuration items, select Site Configuration &gt; Logs. Click the Rule Log button on the ribbon. Select Incident from the Type menu, enter the incident reference number in the ID field and click Search. The rules that acted upon the incident will be listed in the text box. Check the configuration of the rule that acted on the incident and determine if the criteria of the rule needs to be modified or if the order of the rules should be modified. Rules will continue processing through the rules list unless the rule includes an action to Stop Processing Rules. Modify the rules as necessary, and compile and activate your rules set. Submit a test incident."

Configure surveys to expire if not taken by a certain date;Answer ID 983;Is it possible withÃ‚Â Feedback to have surveys expire by a certain date if a person does not respond to that survey in that time frame?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Survey Expiration Feedback in Oracle B2C Service, All supported versions;  Because many surveys are needed for only a limited period of time, you can set an absolute date and time when a survey automatically expires. In addition to an absolute expiration date, broadcast and transactional surveys can be set to expire relative to the date you send the invitation message. Relative expiration Â can help you capture feedback in a relative time frame so that you can make decisions based on your insight. Say you create a recurring survey that filters every day for new customers to gather feedback about why your organization was selected. Also, you want to receive this feedback within 30 days. Since the survey is triggered daily, setting a relative expiration date instead of an absolute date keeps the survey active for all new customers, but also sets an expiration date relative to the contact it is sent to. You can also set survey expiration based on the maximum number of responses you have received. For instance, suppose you want to offer your customers an incentive for their feedback. You could offer a coupon to the first 1,000 responses you receive. This option is available for all survey types, including survey by proxy. In addition, you can customize the expiration message, per survey, that recipients receive if they try to take an expired survey. This helps ensure your recipients know the right course of action to take when an expiration message displays. To set absolute or relative survey expirations:   Open the survey for editing Click the Summary tab Click Edit next to Expiration Date Set survey expiration: a) Â Select Time to Expire Survey and then type the date and time you want the survey to expire or click the calendar to select the date. b) Select Relative Expiration (available in broadcast and transactional surveys) Â and then type the number of days you want to set the survey to expire after you send the invitation message. Â  To cancel an existing survey absolute Â expiration date, set to No Value. Select 'Today' to expire a survey at the current date and time. Click OK Save survey Â    Notes: - Â The maximum days you can set for relative expiration is 365 days. - Â If you set both an absolute expiration date and relative expiration, the criteria that is met first triggers the survey to expire. - Â If a contact is past the first page and the survey expires, the survey will still be accepted. This means that there is a chance that surveys will be logged after the expiration date. - Â For recurring surveys, only an absolute expiration date will expire an entire survey because relative expiration applies only to the contact the survey is sent to.  To set expiration based on maximum number of responses:   Open the survey for editing Click the Summary tab Click None next to Expiration Â Max Responses Â  Select Â 'Limit Responses' check box and then type the maximum number of responses you want to allow. Click OK Save survey   Note: The maximum number of survey responses that you can define is one million. A response is counted as soon as the answer to the first question is submitted. If you set both an absolute expiration date and a maximum number of responses, the criteria that is met first triggers the survey to expire.  To customize the expiration message:  1. Open the survey for editing 2. Click the Summary tab 3. Click Â Edit next to Expiration Â Message Â  4. Type the message you want recipients to see when they try to take an expired survey in the Expiration Message text box. You can use HTML tags in this text box. Â  5. Click OK 6. Save survey Note: If you do not define your own survey expiration message, the system's default message is used.  For additional information, refer to the Â 'Setting survey expiration' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Incident responses are showing the Reply To address for another interface;Answer ID 986;Why are incident responses showing the Reply To address for our other interface?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Outgoing Email, Incident Response Messages Oracle B2C Service; When a user submits a new incident in our main interface, the Reply To address in the response is usually correct for the interface, such as support@interface1.com. In some circumstances, however, responses are being sent with the Reply To address for one of our other interfaces, such as support@interface2.com. The Reply-To address for an incident response is not configured from workflow rules. Â The Reply-To address corresponds to the mailbox associated with the incident. When editing an incident, the Mailbox field allows you to associate each incident to a specific mailbox. The reply-to address used with the response is determined by the configuration of the mailbox that is selected. Â The Mailbox field is located on the Details tab. By selecting a different mailbox when you edit an incident, you can override the default mailbox used for that interface or the mailbox the incident was originally associated with. This means that future responses will be sent from the mailbox you select. Since different mailboxes can have different display names and different reply-to addresses, you can ensure that the incident is associated with the proper mailbox for the content of the incident. Therefore, if the reply-to address is not correct for the interface, open the incident for editing and check which mailbox it is associated with. In addition, verify that the reply-to address is configured correctly for the mailbox.

Escalation email is not being sent or received;Answer ID 987;Why isn't the escalation email being sent or received?;['Answer ID 1873'];   Business Rules, Rule Log, Notifications  Issue   We created a few escalation rules to notify people when their incidents are getting old,Ã‚Â but the email was not sent to the specified address.;"  You can use the Rule Log to determine if incidents are matching the escalation rules to trigger the sending of an email message. For more information on using the Rule Log, refer to Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log to Troubleshoot Rules. In the event that the escalation rule is being matched but the recipient does not get the email, Â check the following:  Check the configuration of the rule to verify that the email address is listed correctly. Â   Â  In the rule, verify that only one address is listed in the Send E-mail To text box. Â   Â  In the Messages table (or Message Templates table, if enabled), Â verify that the Incident Escalated email message is enabled. If you are using multiple interfaces, check that the Incident Escalated message is enabled in all appropriate interfaces.  Note: There is a difference between the Email &gt; Email Incident Information and Email &gt; Send Escalation Notification actions.  The Email Incident Information action sends an email to the email address configured or to the email address for the staff members selected in that action. Â  The staff member does not have to be logged into the system to receive the email.  Â  The Send Escalation Notification action sends a notification to the Communication Center Â for the staff members configured for that action. The staff member only receives an email if their preferences are configured to Send an Email for notifications.  Therefore, if you are expecting an email to be sent to your Inbox, check the action listed in the escalation rule to ensure that the action is Email Incident Notification. Â  If the action in the rule Â is Send Escalation Notification, then the personal preferences for the staff member must have the Send Email and Notify Always boxes enabled in order for an email to be sent when the notification is sent to the Communication Center."

Configuring a rule that sends a standard response to the customer;Answer ID 1001;How do I set up a rule that automatically appends a response to the incident and sends the response to the customer?;['Answer ID 453'];  Incident Rules, Standard Text;" Within your Oracle B2C Service application, you can configure rules to append standard responses automatically to incoming incidents based on the criteria you specify. This allows you to provide standard information to common requests based on the content of the assistance request. For example, if the assistance request contains a certain word or phrase, you can use a Â standard response that suggests the customer view a specific answer in your knowledge base or to view a specific Web page. You can also use this approach to display or send links to Â suggested answers based on the content submitted. To create an incident rule that appends a standard text response to the Â Response field, you must first create the standard response. You can then create the rule that appends the response and sends (or displays) the response to the enduser. Â  Email Submittals: Â  For incidents created from email, you can configure a rule to automatically append a standard text response to the Response field and send the response to the end-user. You can also have the rule set the incident to Solved or some other specific status.  Â  Ask a Question Requests: For assistance requests submitted through the Ask a Question page, you can Â have a standard text response display directly to your end-user when they submit the request. If the Â assistance request matches the rule criteria, then the standard response displays right on the web page. Â   Â  Your site visitors may find that your standard Â response information solves their issue and may therefore decide not to finish submitting the incident to your staff. Â  By providing a standard response to your end-users, you can actually prevent incidents from being submitted from the Ask a Question page. Â    STEP 1: Create the Standard Response: First, you must create a standard text response to be used in the rule. This is the content that is either sent in an email to the end-user Â or Â is displayed when the end-user submits the Ask a Question request. HTML and Text Values: When configuring a standard response, the content in the HTML Â field is used with a rule used to display information when submitting Â an incident from the Â Ask a Question page. That is, when a user submits an Ask a Question request, it is the content of the HTML field that displays on the web page during the submittal process. Note: Where an HTML value does not exist and the append rule is active, the Text content will be displayed during the Ask a Question submittal process. When configuring content in the HTML field, you must include appropriate HTML code so that line-spacing and formatting work as you expect. When Visual Email is enabled and the Rich Text thread control exists on your workspace, the content of the HTML field gets appended to the incident and is visible from within the console. The value that is sent as part of an incident response (Text or HTML) depends on if the associated Message Template / Message type Â is enabled for HTML or not. If the Incident Thread control is used in the workspace, the content of the Text field is what gets appended to the incident. Suggested Solutions: To include links to suggested answers from your knowledge base in your standard response, append the SmartAssistant Solutions variable to your response. The variable displays as $SOLUTIONS within the standard response. When the $SOLUTIONS variable is included, the application evaluates the content of the submitted question and determines the best-matching published answers based on that content. The best matching answers are listed as links for the end-user to view. Â  To create a standard response for your rule: Â  use the steps below: From the Configuration items, select Service &gt; Standard Text. Â (Oracle B2C Service Â February 2010 and previous releases: Service Configuration menu, select Content Library &gt; Standard Text.)  Â  To add a new standard text click the New button on the ribbon. To edit an existing standard text, click on Standard Text in the menu on the left.  Â  Enter the name and check the Rule Text checkbox. If necessary, you can also check the Incident Text box for use when editing incidents.  Â  Enter the message text in the Â Text field. Â   Â  Note: To include the Suggested Solutions as part of a standard response, append the SmartAssistant Solutions variable. When editing the response, you can add the $SOLUTIONS variable, either by typing the variable directly into the response or by clicking the $ icon in the Value bar. Â   Â  If using the standard text with Ask a Question submittals, add content to the HTML field.  Â  Â  Click Add.   STEP 2: Create the Business Rule When configuring the rule, two actions Â can be Â included in the THEN part of the rule: Add Action - Then Â &gt; Append Thread &gt; Append Response Template to Response Field Â  -- then select the appropriate standard text item. Â  Â   Â  Add Action - Then &gt; Email &gt; Send Email Response to Sender Â  -- this action sends the response email message in place of the receipt email message so that the Response field is included in the email that is sent to the end-user. Â  Â  The first action selects and appends the standard text item to the incident, and the second action sends the response email message Â to the end-user in place of the receipt email so that the Response field is included in the email that is sent to the end-user. With the standard Â text created, you can Â create an incident rule to append your standard response into the response field of the incident and send the response to the end-user. The path to edit incident rules is: Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Rules. Â Click the Â Incident button on the ribbon in Edit Â mode. After editing and updating Â your rules, be sure to compile and Â activate the rules for use. To send a response for an incident submitted from an email sent to a mailbox, configure the rule as follows: IF: Â  Incident Source equals Utilities &gt; Techmail &gt; Service Mailbox THEN: 1. Â  Add Action - Then &gt; Append Thread &gt; Append Response Template to Response Field and select standard text from list. 2. Â  Add Action - Then &gt; Email &gt; Send Email Response to Sender For instructions on configuring your site to display suggested solutions when submitting a request from the Ask a Question page, refer to Answer ID 453: Suggesting Solutions for Ask a Question Requests."

Effect on other tables when a staff account is deleted or moved;Answer ID 1004;What happens in other tables when a staff account is either assigned to another group or deleted from the staff table?;['Answer ID 453'];   Staff Account, Incidents, Answers Any tableÃ‚Â that includes theÃ‚Â assigned groupÃ‚Â ID will be effected.Ã‚Â ;"  When Â a staff member is moved to another group, all incidents Â that are not Â Solved or Closed Â are Â assigned to the staff member Â are moved to Â the new staff group. For example, if you move Â Jane from Tier 1 to Tier 2, Â Jane's incidents are assigned to Tier 2 / Jane after her account is moved. Answers are also then assigned to Tier 2 / Jane. Likewise, you'll see a new entry in the Inciden'ts audit log since the incident was updated with a new assigned group ID. The audit log entry will have ""From Explorer"" in the description. Â  If you delete a staff member, the record remains assigned to the group, but is not assigned to a specific staff member. In terms of reporting data, the transactions remain with the group assignment at the time of the transaction. Therefore, when assigning a staff member to another group, all past activity for that account remains associated with the original group and all activity after the group change is associated with the new group. If you delete a staff group, the records are not assigned to any staff group or staff account. The Assigned field display as blank when viewing the record. Note: Â Before you delete a group, you must either move or delete all staff members from that group. In general, it is not recommended that you delete a staff group since you lose historical information about the records that were handled and assigned to that group. If you must delete a group, it is best to reassign the associated records to another group. It is especially important to reassign your unresolved and waiting incidents, so that responsibility for those incidents is clearly defined and assigned."

Searching by reference number without having to reset the drop-down menus;Answer ID 1026;How can I beÃ‚Â able to search for a specific incident number without having to reset the Status, Group, and Assigned drop-down menus?;['Answer ID 2476'];   Analytics, Quick Search Reports, Navigation Set Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Oracle B2C Service includes a quick search feature to allow Â staff to search for specific records. For example, staff can access an incident by searching on the reference number alone. Similarly, staff can search for an answer by the answer ID value. Within the Â Oracle B2C Service Â Console, quick search reports are listed in a single menu so that staff can search for any record type using the corresponding quick search report. Staff can only access a record using quick search if they have the ability to access the record when using one of the reports they have permission to run. For more information on customizing the quick search reports and functionality, refer to Answer ID 2476: Customizing Quick Search Functionality.

Transaction variations when staff update incidents;Answer ID 1029;What are some statistics on a typical site transaction, i.e. updating an incident?;['Answer ID 2476'];   Incidents, Traceroutes  Issue   We are trying to determine what causes the fluctuations in transaction times when updating an incident in the Oracle B2C Service database.;"  Response times for updates to the knowledge base do vary. The most common cause of these fluctuations is network traffic on the Internet itself. To get an idea of network traffic, you can use the traceroute utility on your PC. Simply type ""tracert domainname.custhelp.com"". This will provide 3 columns of times; generally, those times over 200 ms indicate network traffic that cause slowed response times. Stars ( * ) in any of the three columns indicate that a ""packet"" was lost- this generally indicates that the server is having serious problems, and also explains slow response times. If you do notice response times of over one minute which the tracert does not explain, please submit a service request via Â Ask Technical Support and indicate that the site is down. Even though technically the site is running, we consider this situation to be site down since performance is so seriously degraded."

Information copied when an incident is proposed as an answer;Answer ID 1034;When an incident is proposed and copied to become an answer, what information is copied along with it?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Incidents, Answer propose Oracle B2C Service;"  When the incident is proposed, the new answer Â has the same summary as the incident it was created from Â and is Â automatically assigned Â to have a Â Proposed status. The proposed answer is NOT automatically assigned to the staff member who proposed it from an incident. This is because typically the staff members responsible for editing and updated answers is a different group of people from the agents who respond to incidents. The agent who proposes the answer may not even have access to edit and update answers based on their staff profile. You can use answer rules to assign new answers to specific staff or groups when the answer is created. From within the answer, you can view the Audit Log to determine who proposed the answer. Â The Â audit log is located on a separate tab by default. When an agent proposes an answer, the agent can edit the content of the incident thread before creating the proposed answer. This allows the agent to remove extraneous content and clearly state a question and answer to be considered for publishing. When the agent proposes an incident, the contents of the incident display in a separate Propose Incident for Answer pop-up window. The first customer entry of the thread is listed in the Question field along with the interface of the proposed incident. The remainder of the thread is added to the Answer field in chronological order. Incident custom fields that are configured with the Migrate on Propose option enabled are listed in the Notes field. Incident custom fields may or may not be included when you propose an incident as an answer. If you propose an incident from an incidents report, by either right-clicking the incident and selecting Propose or by clicking the Propose button on the reportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ribbon, the incident custom fields are not added to the Notes tab on the Propose Incident for Answer window. If, however, you click the Propose button from an open incident, the custom fields do appear on the Propose Incident for Answer window. In addition, the default product and category for the answer is set based on the product and category of the incident. Â The agent can edit the products and categories for the Â proposed answer and remove incident file attachments from being copied to the new answer. When proposing an incident for an answer, on the Files tab, all the attachments in the incident are included. This means also the raw_message.mht if the EGW_SAVE_ORIG_MESSAGE is enabled. All the attachments in the incident are automatically selected and can be unchecked by the agent proposing the incident by going to the Files tab on the Propose Incident for Answer window. When the agent clicks OK on the Propose Incident for Answer pop-up, the proposed answer is created and a small pop-up displays to the agent indicating the answer ID for the new answer. To include or exclude an incident custom field when proposing an answer, use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select Database &gt; Â Custom Fields &gt; Incident Custom Fields. Â  In the left-hand frame, right-click on the field name and select Edit. In the Visibility section, click the Migrate on Proposed check box to enable or disable the field. Click Save.

Using the Logical Expression feature in reports;Answer ID 1041;How do I use the Logical Expression feature in reports?;['Answer ID 84', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Logical Expressions in Report Filters Oracle B2C Service;"  The logical expression feature allows significant flexibility when defining reports. By default, when multiple filters are included in a report, all filters are joined with an AND (&amp;) Boolean connector. Â  However, you can customize the logical expression to use an Â OR ( | ) join between filters or groups of filters as well. Note: Logical expressions are also used when configuring rulesets. Â  For more information on using logical expressions with rules, refer to Answer ID 84: Using 'OR' logic with business rules. When you add multiple filters to the report, the logical expression automatically joins the filters with an AND connector.  Therefore, to customize the logical expression used for your report, the first step is to add an OR node. Then, drag and drop the filters that are joined with an OR join into the OR node. Â   Within the OR node, you can also add an AND sub-node for more complex expressions.  When adding a node to an expression, you are adding a parenthetical component where the elements within the node are joined by either OR or AND. Â  That is, adding an OR node is like adding ( __ | __ ) or ( __ OR __ ) Â to Â the logical expression. Â  For this reason, you must have at least Â two components listed under a node. Â  You can drag and drop filters into the node or you can add sub-nodes and then drag filters to the sub-nodes.  The Edit Text Definition link allows you to review how your filters are grouped and the operators between them. Â  This allows you to verify the configuration of the expression. From the Edit Logical Expression window, you can add, edit or delete filters from your report. In addition, you can click on a node and delete that node. Caution: If you delete a node, it also deletes all filters and sub-nodes. Therefore, to delete a node without deleting the filters, you must first drag the filters to a higher level (such as the top AND node) and then delete the node. To modify the logical expression used with your report: Â use the steps below:  Open the report for editing. Â    From the Home tab, click Filters from the Data Set section.  Â  In the Logical Expression window, the filters are listed under an AND node, indicating they are all joined using an AND join. Â  Â    To add an OR node, click Add OR Node. Â    Drag and drop filters to the OR node. Â    Click View Text Definition to review the logical expression. Â    When finished, click OK to close the Edit Logical Expression window and save your report.  Note: If you want all of your filters to be joined with an OR connector, add the OR node and then drag and drop all of your filters to the OR node. Â   Use of Parentheses  Within the logical expression string, the use of parentheses is very important. If no parentheses are included, the criteria are evaluated solely by the order listed in the Logical Expression box. For example, there is a significant difference between expressions A and B below:  Expression A: 1 &amp; (2 | 3) Expression B: 1 &amp; 2 | 3  Without parentheses, comparisons are made strictly by the order the criteria are listed. As a result, the expression 1 &amp; 2 | 3 corresponds to (1 &amp; 2) | 3.  With expression A, an item matches if criteria 1 is met Â AND either criteria 2 or 3 is met. Â  No matter what, criteria 1 must be met in order for the record to match. Â    With expression B, an item matches if criteria 1 and 2 are met OR if criteria 3 is met. If criteria 3 is met, it does not matter if 1 or 2 are met. Â  If criteria 1 and 2 are met, it does not matter if criteria 3 is met.  For additional information, refer to the 'Edit a Logical Expression' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Difference between organization and contact custom fields;Answer ID 1044;What is the difference between organization and contact custom fields?;['Answer ID 84', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Custom Fields for Contacts versus Organizations;" A Â contact refers to an individual person who has an account in your Oracle B2C Service database. An organization refers to a group of associated contacts, such as a company, division, or department. Organization custom fields allow you to add and define information related to an organization record. The information contained in organization fields apply to all contacts that are associated with that organization as opposed to information used with a single contact record. If you edit the organization information for a specific contact, the updated information displays for all other contacts who are associated with the same organization. This allows you to update common, organizational information quickly and easily. For example, purchase dates, renewal dates, and products supported may be candidates as organization custom fields if the information is identical across all contacts for the specific group. Contact custom fields can be set independently for your different contact records -- even if those contacts belong to the same organization. To add an organization field, use the steps below: From the Configuration items, select Database &gt; Custom Fields &gt; Organization Custom Fields.  Â  On the ribbon click the New button to add a New Organizational Field.  Â  Enter the name of the field and select the type of field using the drop-down menu.

Routing incidents based on the time they are submitted;Answer ID 1059;Can I route incidents based on the time they are submitted?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Business Rules, All versions; When creating rules for routing incidents, you can use the Incident.Created Â field in the IF section of your workflow rule to route incidents based on the time they are created. This allows you to manage incidents that are submitted outside of normal working hours differently if necessary. If your company provides 24-hour support, you can choose to route incidents to appropriate work groups working the same shift that the incident is created, thus ensuring timely responses to your customers. The Â Incident.Created field can be used both in workflow and escalation rules. When creating a rule, you can use the in range and not in range operators to specify a time interval for comparison. For example, to configure an interval between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. use the IF criteria: IF Incident.Created in range 8:00 16:00 You can use the not in range operator to specify the time period before and after your specified time interval.

With regard to the techmail utility specifically, users can click the techmail link for a specific interface, which displays information about the most recent techmail runs for that interface. The table gives the run date for the utility, the run time, Â the exit code, and a brief message regarding the run's execution. Please note, some of these messages are general notifications and can Â apply to Â the run logs of other utilities as well. Definitions for the possible messages is listed below:        No Error: This message indicates that the utility ran satisfactorily. Â              Exceeds concurrent utilities per db server, retrying later   OR   Per DB server concurrent utility lock. Re-queuing. Not an error.   This message is simply a warning regarding the workers assigned to each database server. This message means that all workers assigned to the queue are currently processing other jobs. These jobs will continue to wait in queue until a worker is available to process them. The retry interval in this scenario is very short.     It is possible to get a couple of these messages in a row depending on Â the load on the utility and the utility schedule (especially with the retry interval being so short). If you see these messages extending for long periods of time with no successful runs in between, you can contact Â Technical Support for further investigation.                Locked. This task is already running / Lock file exists: As part of our utility scripts, we place a ""lock file"" in each interface directory on the server while a utility is running for a given interface. This prevents utilities from running twice on the same data.    It is possible to get a couple of these messages in a row depending on the load on the utility and the utility schedule. This is not an error, and is expected behavior.         Interface is in broken sites: This error means that your utility is not running. The common causes for this error message are due to an issue with the utility which most times is resolved by upgrading to the latest version of CX.    Hosting monitors the ""broken sites"" list and will resolve issues and/or proactively create an incident to resolve the issue and move the utility to no-utils. Â              Interface is in no-utils: This message means that a member of the Hosting group has put your interface into the ""no-utils"" list. This list is used by Hosting to unconditionally prevent a utility from being run against any given interface. Â  When a utility is in no-utils, an incident has been created, and Technical Support is actively working on the issue.   If you suspect an issue is due to a utility refer to Answer ID 2697: Hosting notifications for suspended utility runs Â for information on the impact of a non running utility.         Cannot execute utility: The most common reasons for this message is that your site has been put into ""maintenance mode"" or an interface has been disabled.             Error connecting to socket: This error generally means that techmail is trying to access a non Oracle B2C Service hosted mailbox and the firewall protecting your mail server is not allowing our connection through, or an unsupported port is being used on an OCI datacenter.    The fix for this is to have your IT department add the appropriate exception on your firewall on port 110 or 995. We do not suggest that an exception(s) is made Â for an IP address or individual server name Â but rather for the proper domain such as *.rightnowtech.com, as indicated in Solutions for whitelisting our mail servers.

PASS (MailBox Open state): Â The most common cause of this error is that your mailboxes table has an incorrect password for one of your pop accounts. When the error occurs due to a password failure the error messages will continue until the password is fixed. Â  Â However, intermittent or self correcting errors of this type can be ignored. Intermittent errors of this type can occur when the mailbox is being accessed internally and is already open.    If you have multiple mailboxes and the error occurs consistently, please submit an Ask Technical Support to Technical Support to investigate which mailbox has the incorrect password Â    *Note: Passwords for mailboxes cannot be more than 20 characters. This will cause the Â  Â PASS (MailBox Open state) message to appear.         USER (MailBox Open state): Is similar to PASS (MailBox Open state) and usually Â caused by your mailboxes table having an incorrectly specified pop account or problems with the access to a specific account. Intermittent or self correcting errors of this type can also be ignored.           Can't map POP Server to Host IP: This is a common error where one of the pop servers in your mailboxes has an invalid host name in it. The most common host name that we see as invalid is ""server"".    To fix this either configure the mailbox correctly with the proper host name or delete or disable this mailbox.             Maximum allowed errors processing messages: This message is seen when the number of message processor failures exceed the allotted limit for any given run of techmail. When message processor encounters an unrecoverable error an incident with the subject ""Error Processing Incident"" is created to retain the data.       A message processor failure can be caused by many things so a limit is placed on the number of failures that can be encountered in a single run of techmail (typically three) in order to prevent intermittent issues or faulty customizations creating a mass number of ""Error Processing Email"" incidents.       In any event, a small percentage of message processor failures will be unavoidable and is considered expected behavior especially on sites with large amounts of traffic. As such, you should always have an internal business process for handling these types of incidents and routing them properly.

Publishing different answers to different interfaces;Answer ID 1096;How do I configure Oracle B2C Service to display different answers for different interfaces?;['Answer ID 645'];   Answers, Interfaces;"  When publishing answers to your end-user pages, the following conditions must all be met in order for the answer to appear on the end-user pages of a particular interface:  the product, category, and access level must be enabled for end-user visibility -- including all sub-levels of products and categories, Â    the language field of the answer must be the same as the language used for the interface, Â    and the status must be a public status type.  With multiple interfaces that use the same language, you can modify the visibility of the product, category, and access level so that answers appear on only certain interfaces. If your interfaces use different languages, you can use the Language field to designate which interface the answer should appear on.  Same Language Interfaces  If your multiple interfaces use the same language, the actual content of the information for each interface is different for each of the interfaces. As a result, to control the display of information for each interface, you can configure different products and/or categories to be used with each interface or you can create custom access levels for each interface. Option 1: Specifying Unique Products and Categories for Each Interface Depending on how similar the content is across your interfaces, you might want to create new products and/or categories to correspond with each interface. When you assign a specific answer to the appropriate product and category, it displays on only the interface(s) that have visibility enabled for those products and categories. This option works well when your interfaces display information for entirely different products or services. For instance, if you have two interfaces, say Interface1 and Interface2, create new products specific to each interface. For example, Products A, B, and C can be used with Interface1 and Products D, E, and F can be used with Interface 2. Similarly, you can also create unique categories to be used with each interface. To add products and categories to display for a single interface, use the steps below. For more comprehensive information on adding products and categories, refer to Answer ID 645: Adding Products and Categories.   From Configuration, select Service &gt; Products/Categories/Dispositions. Â    Click in the product, category, or dispositions section and then click the New button on the ribbon. Â    Enter the name of the product, category or disposition. Â    In the Visibility section, enable or disable the check boxes for each interface listed. The Administration box, if enabled, will include the value in the drop-down menus for incidents and answers for that interface. The End-User check box, if enabled, will include the value in the drop-down menus on the end-user pages for the interface.  Be sure the End User check boxes are enabled for the interfaces which should display the product or category value. Â    Click Save or Add. Â    Add additional products and categories as needed. Â    Go to the end-user pages for each interface and verify the values in the Products and Categories drop-down menus.  Publishing from one interface: If you wish to publish answers to multiple interfaces by editing the answer from a specific interface, you need to enable the products and category visibility so that the value is enabled for Admin visibility. Â If a product or category is enabled to be visible for one of your interfaces, that value displays for all interfaces when working with answers. That is, if a product is enabled for administration visibility for interface A, that product also displays when working with answers in interfaces B or C. CAUTION: When adjusting visibility on products or categories, removing Admin visibility from a product or category will disassociate the product/category from all answers to which it is tied. Â  This can cause answers to disappear from the end-user pages, and restoring Admin visibility to the product/category will not automatically associate the prior answers to that product/category. Â  Instead, the product/category must be manually reassociated to appropriate answers. Ordering items: In general, it is best to order products or categories together by the interface they are associated with. In addition, you can include a separator or divider value to the list to make it more clear which products or categories are used with which interface. For example, you can create a product named START OF INTERFACE A that is only enabled for Admin visibility for the appropriate interfaces and then group the interface A products under it: START OF INTERFACE A Product 1 Product 2 Product 3 START OF INTERFACE B Product 4 Product 5 Product 6 Option 2: Specifying Unique Answer Access Levels for Each Interface If you have two interfaces (Interface1 and Interface2), you can create custom answer access levels for each interface and assign the Answers to the appropriate access level. For instance, if you have two interfaces (Interface1 and Interface2), you can create new answer access levels named Public1 and Public2. To add a new access level to display answers for a specific interface, use the steps below:  From Configuration, select Application Appearance &gt; Customizable Menus &gt; Answer Access Levels. Select System Menus, Â double-click on Answer Access Level. Click the New button on the ribbon and enter the name. In the Interface Visibility section, enable the Visibility check box for the interface that will display answers assigned to this access level. For example, if you added Public1 as an access level, then enable the check box for Interface 1. Click Save or Add.  To display an answer as public on Interface1: set its access level to coincide with the access level configured to display on the first interface. Similarly, to display an answer on Interface2, set its access level to coincide with the access level configured to display on the second interface. Note: If you are using products and categories, the answer must be assigned to products and categories visible to the interface you are publishing answers to.  Different Languages For Separate Interfaces  When using multiple interfaces that utilize different languages, you can use the Language field to differentiate which answers will display on which interface. For example, if you have an English interface and a German interface, selecting en_US from the Language drop-down menu when editing the answer will allow that answer to display on the English interface. Similarly, selecting de_DE from the Language menu when editing the Answer allows the Answer to display on the German interface. If your application uses different language packs for your different interfaces, you can use common fields across your interfaces. You can edit the name of the field for each language pack in your site. For example, you can specify different language names for the same product, category, access level or custom field. In this way, the overall number of fields is reduced and you can ensure greater commonality across the different interfaces."

Visibility settings with custom fields;Answer ID 1102;When adding custom fields, what do the visibility settings mean?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 7868'];   Custom Fields Oracle B2C Service;"  Important! It is best practice to add and deploy custom fields during off-peak hours. When custom fields are added, update statements must be performed against the corresponding database table (these changes Â can also be Â subject to failover and replication depending on the table size). During the time of the updates, the records in the table are inaccessible. As a result, your staff members will not be able to open or save records associated with the table that is locked. In addition, depending on the type of field being added, your end-users may have difficulty submitting assistance requests through the Ask a Question page. For example, when adding a contact custom field, the contacts table is locked to allow the custom field to be added in to all of your contact records. As a result, staff are unable to open or save incidents since the contact information is opened along with the incident record.  When configuring custom fields, the visibility options determine where custom fields are visible on the administrative and end-user pages and whether or not the field can be edited by the staff member or the end-user. Specific visibility settings depend on the type of custom field you are configuring. Â The visibility options also depend on which components of Â Oracle B2C Service Â are enabled for use, including Â Oracle Service Chat, Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service, and Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service. Visibility is also designated by interface. Â  Â The use of custom fields in views and reports is dependent on the visibility of the custom field for the interface. Â  Â If the custom field is not visible to the interface, then they cannot be used as filters or columns in reports or views (if applicable to the version).  For a comprehensive list of visibility options based on the type of custom field, refer to:  The 'Setting custom field visibility' section in online documentation for the version your site is running. Â  Â To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Â   Â  Â  Online help from within your Oracle B2C Service console. From the console, select Help &gt; Help Contents. Then expand Common &gt; Custom Fields &gt; Setting custom field visibility.

Meta-answers and sibling answers;Answer ID 1111;What are meta-answers and sibling answers?;['Answer ID 2518', 'Answer ID 2309', 'Answer ID 2163'];  Answers, Meta-Answers, Relationships and Siblings;" A meta-answer is best thought of as a ""container"" for an answer or answers. The meta-answer defines some basic properties of the answers within it, such as product and category assignments and common file attachments. For example, you have one answer that you need translated into different languages, or one answer that is slightly changed for different customers. Answers that are assigned to the same meta-answer are quite closely related in that the individual answers within the meta-answer typically answer the same question, but provide different information to different groups of end-users. Â  Â These answers are called sibling answers. Â  Sibling answers share the same meta-answer ID at the database level and share product and category values. Siblings: Â  Â The concept of the meta-answer runs behind the scenes with regards to answers and sibling answers. Within Oracle B2C Service, the term ""meta-answer"" does not display within the answer record or the console. Â  However, sibling answers Â that are listed on the Relationships tab within an answer still share the same meta-answer ID in the database and Â share product and category assignments. The Siblings Answers section of the Relationship tab may be disabled in your workspace. To enable the Siblings Answers section, you must enable the Siblings Visible property in the workspace. To enable this property, use the steps below: Open the answer workspace for editing. Click on the Relationships tab. Click the body of the tab and change the Siblings Visible property to True. Â  Save the workspace. Similarly, on the Files or Attachments tab, you can enable the Siblings Visible property as well. Â  Â Open the answer workspace for editing, click the Attachments tab and click on the attachments control item on the body of the tab. Â  Â Then from the Design options at the top of the workspace, set the Siblings Visible to be True and save the workspace. This enables a second section on the Â tab. Â  Attachments added to this lower Â section of the tab Â display for the answer and all its siblings. This allows you to attach one file attachment Â and display it for all siblings. For more information on editing workspace properties, refer to Answer ID 2518: Setting Properties in Workspaces. Meta-answer ID values: Answer IDs and meta-answer IDs are distinct Â fields in the database. Â These Â fields may have different Â values for Â answers within your application. Â  For example, an answer with an Answer ID of 250 may have a Meta-answer ID value of 234. To determine Â the meta-answer ID associated with an answer, you can create a report or view Â that lists both the answer ID (a_id) and the meta-answer ID (m_id) from the answers table Â as output columns. This allows you to easily see and compare the ID values for each answer. Meta-answer uses: In most cases, there is only one answer for each meta-answer (container). However, Â sibling answers Â are frequently used Â for the two conditions below: Your site has multiple interfaces that uses more than one language pack, i.e. English and German. Â   Â  Your site utilizes privileged access (as enabled by the ANS_PRV_ENABLED configuration setting).  Multiple Language Sites Sibling answers are used specifically when your site has multiple interfaces and uses more than one language pack ; for example, if your site has an English interface and a Spanish interface. The meta-answer Â groups similar answers across multiple interfaces and languages. In this case, the question and solution are similar in content, but individual answers must be created for each language used. By grouping these similar individual answers (siblings) together, Â you can more easily find and maintain the content of all the sibling answers. For example, if you had one question about warranty information answered in different languages on each of your interfaces, Â the meta-answer is what Â ""contains"" or relates all the associated answers together. The answers would all share the same product and category information, and if the warranty information ever changed, you could easily locate and adjust each sibling answer.  Privileged Access When privileged access  Â is enabled, you can provide different answers to your site visitors depending on which level of access they are configured for. While the general question may be the same for all of your end-users, the specific content of the answer may vary for the different levels of privileged access. An individual answer can be created for each level of access, but the meta-answer feature allows you to group the individual answers as siblings so that you can update the product and/or category values all at once or find the related answers based on the meta-answer ID. Note: Â With conditional sections, it is easier to use a single answer to support multiple privileged access users. For more information on using conditional sections, refer to Answer ID 2309: Adding Conditional Sections to Published Answers. For example, if you have a company that has access to a privileged level of information that contains a more detailed answer to a question, you can create Â sibling answers Â that are Â associated with the same meta-answer. In this case, two answers would belong to a single meta-answer -- both the simplified version of the answer that is accessed by everyone, and a detailed version of the answer that can be accessed only by the specified company. Visibility: Â  When two or more sibling answers exist, only one answer will display to the end-user. When used with privileged access, the answer assigned to the highest access level as listed in the Access Levels table is what displays to the user. That way, only the privileged content displays to your privileged users and the answer assigned to the Everyone access level does not display to privileged users. If the end-user does not have privileged access, then the Everyone answer will display to that user.  Â  Enabling or Disabling Meta-Answers / Siblings Â  Sibling answers display only if the answer workspace allows siblings to display. Â  For information on modifying answer workspaces to include sibling answers, refer to Answer ID 2163: Accessing Sibling Answers. When copying answers, you can enable the Create Sibling Relationship check box so that the new answer is a sibling to the answer that is being copied. If the checkbox is clear, the new answer will be a stand-alone answers that does not share a meta-answer ID or product and category assignment Â with the answer that was copied."

Publishing an answer to the end-user pages;Answer ID 1112;How do I publish an answer to our end-user pages?;['Answer ID 4069', 'Answer ID 1999', 'Answer ID 1096', 'Answer ID 645', 'Answer ID 1096', 'Answer ID 48', 'Answer ID 208', 'Answer ID 1838', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, Answer Visibility Settings Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  When publishing answers in Oracle B2C Service, several conditions must be met in order for the answer to appear in an search on the end-user pages of a particular interface. If even one of the conditions listed below is not met, the answer will not display.  Important Considerations  Answer workspaces: Â  Â The Language, Answer Status, and Access Level Â must be included in the answer workspace used to publish answers. In addition, if Products and Categories are enabled, those fields must be included in the workspace so that the fields can be set. If you remove any of these fields, the answer is saved with the default value for that field. For answers, the default values are:  Â  Â  Â  Â Type = Answer_Type_Html  Â  Â  Â  Â Access Mask = Everyone  Â  Â  Â  Â Assigned = Account/Group of agent logged in  Â  Â  Â  Â Language = Current language of interface logged in  Â  Â  Â  Â Position = Historical Usefulness  Â  Â  Â  Â Status = Private  Visibility of sub-products or sub-categories: Â The product or category that determines the visibility of answers does not have to be the lowest level. For more information refer to Answer ID 4069: Product and Category checkboxes with green fill color. Note: When editing product and category visibility, you must close the product/category edit Â page before meta-answer visibility information is refreshed. In other words, changes to product and category visibility will not affect answer visibility until you close out of the product or category window. Publish On Date field: Â You can enable the Publish On date field for use with creating and publishing answers. Â The Publish On field allows you to set a future date for when the answer should be published. On the date specified, the answer status will change to the Public status Â automatically from whatever status it had been assigned to. Therefore, in order for the answer to be published successfully, all other criteria must be set when you set the Publish On date. For example, if a product is not set, the status will change to Public, but since the product is not set, the answer is still not visible on the end-user pages. For more information on this feature, refer to Answer ID 1999: Publishing Answers Automatically.   Publishing Criteria  In order for an answer to be published to the end-user pages, the criteria below must be met. For more information on publishing Answers to a specific interface if your site has multiple interfaces, refer to Answer 1096: Publishing Answers to Multiple Interfaces.        Product association: Â  If products (and sub-products if applicable) are enabled on the end-user pages, the answer must be assigned to at least one value that is visible to the interface as configured in the Products table. Â   Â For more information on configuring products and categories, refer to Answer ID 645: Configuring Products and Categories. Â            Category association: Â  If categories (and sub-categories if applicable) are enabled on the end-user pages, the answer must be assigned to at least one value that is visible to the end-user pages for the interface as configured in the Categories table. The lowest sub-level must be enabled for Â end-user visibility. Â            Language association: Â  The language specified for the answer must correspond with the language specified for the interface. Â See Answer ID 1096: Publishing different answers to different interfaces Â for more information.           Answer Status: Â  The answer status for the answer must be a public status type as configured in the Answer Statuses table. Â Refer to Answer ID 48: Default incident and answer statuses Â for more information.           Access Level: Â  The access level for the answer must be a visible for the interface as configured in the Answer Access Levels table. Â  See Answer ID 208: Specifying answer access levels to display on the end-user pages Â for more details.    If using privileged access, the access level should not have the visibility check box enabled, but rather the contact or organization record must allow access to that access level via an applied Service Level Agreement (SLA). Â See  Â Answer ID 1838: Setting up privileged access Â for more information.           Customer Portal Answer Search Report: Â  The end-user report or view Â must be configured to allow the answers to be displayed. By default, the end-user page Â includes a fixed filter for the access level that is set to User Access. This filter allows end-users to view answers that are set to access levels that either have end-user visibility enabled or are used for privileged access. The Oracle B2C Service application is designed to work optimally with a fixed filter in place for access level  Â equal to User Access. Â     If the end-user report or view is modified to restrict answers to a specific access level, product, or category, any answers that are assigned to other values will not be accessible -- even if that value is enabled for end-user visibility.    If you are using the default end-user report, the user_access filter is included in the default report. Â  If you are using a customized report, refer to the 'Changing the search report' section in online documentation for more information on finding and editing the custom report. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.    If the fixed filter for the access level is removed, answers published to a specific interface may display on other interfaces as well since the filter is not in effect to restrict answer visibility by access level.      Note: Only answer records can be published to the Answers tab on your end-user interface. You cannot publish an incident directly to the Answers tab. You must first propose the incident as an answer by clicking the Propose button. Then you must edit the answer for final publishing.

Adding custom fields;Answer ID 1131;What are the fields to define when adding a custom field?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 1102'];   Custom Fields, Creating / Editing Oracle B2C Service;"  Important! It is best to add custom fields (as well as Â edits to navigation sets and agent workspaces) Â during off-peak hours. When custom fields are added, update statements must be performed against the corresponding database table. During the time of the updates, the records in the table are inaccessible. As a result, your staff members will not be able to open or save records associated with the table that is locked. In addition, depending on the type of field being added, your end-users may have difficulty submitting assistance requests through the Ask a Question page. For example, when adding a contact custom field, the contacts table is locked to allow the custom field to be added in to all of your contact records. As a result, staff are unable to open or save incidents since the contact information is opened along with the incident record.  Custom fields can be added for several different record types, including:  Common    Staff Account  Contact  Organization  Sales Products  Task   Service    Incident Â   Answer  Opportunity  Opportunity Â Tracking  Quote    See 'Custom Field Types' for a description of each type.  When adding a custom field, you must specify one of the following types of custom field you want to add. Â   Date Date/Time Integer Menu Text Area Text Field Yes/No Opt-in  When adding custom fields in your Oracle B2C Service application, several items must be defined to configure the new field. The Field Configuration table below defines the field descriptions when configuring custom fields. The specific fields that display depend on the type of custom field you add. Â  Not all fields appear for each type of custom field that you add. Â  Note: Once a custom field has been created and saved, the Data Type Â cannot be changed. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. To add a custom field:  Open the Configuration menu Select Database Select Custom Fields&gt; Type of Field. In the ribbon at the top select New Configure the field settings. Click Save.  Note: Depending on the size of the Table you are modifying (eg: Number of Incidents and/or Contacts on your site), adding Custom fields Â can take awhile to complete. Â  If the Custom Field persists in Â showing as stuck in creation, then you may wish to contact our Oracle B2C Service Technical Support team by creating an incident and inquiring into the process. Important! After adding the custom field, you must edit the appropriate workspaces used by your staff and add the custom field to each workspace. Custom fields are not automatically added to workspaces.  Field Configuration  When configuring custom fields, set the following fields:        Data Type: This specifies the type of field to be configured: date, date/time, integer, menu, radio, text area, or text field. Â            Column Name: This is the name of the field as it will appear in the database. This field does not allow spaces or punctuation and cannot begin with a number. Â            Indexed: Select this box to have this field indexed in the database.    Note: Indexing should be used sparingly for custom fields. Â  Â            Default Value: You can add a default value, i.e. text, an integer, a specific item from the drop-down menu, or a radio button pre-selected. If the field is set as Required, the default value is overridden and the end-user or CSR must answer the question. Â    Â   Note: Default values only apply when a human has the opportunity to manually override the default value before it is committed to the database. For example, if an incident custom field specifies a default value, the field will only populate if it is editable to the end-user pages. For incoming Ask a Question submittals, the default value is only added to the custom field if the field is editable to the end-user pages. If you do not want the field to be editable on the end-user page, set up a workflow rule to set the value of the field when it is created. Â            Size of Field: This field only appears when the Data Type is Integer, Text Field, or Text Area. Use this field to set the maximum size of the field. Â            Required: Check the Required box if the field must be filled out when Â a record is created.    Note: Setting a field to be required overrides the default value specified. When the Required box is checked, a default value does not display. The customer or staff member must select an option or enter a value for a required custom field. Â  Â  Â     The Required box Â specifies the default property of the custom field when it is added to a workspace. Within the workspace, you can change the property of the field to not be required so that the field is not required for specific staff who use that workspace.   Â   Similarly, if the Required box is not checked, you can make the field required in a specific workspace so that staff must complete the field either on new records or when they are edited.           Usage: With text fields only. You can specify whether the field is a plain, URL, email address or phone number field.    Plain: the field displays with no special formatting or functionality.    URL: the field displays as a link which opens in a browser when clicked.    Email Address: the value is an email address which easily allows staff to send an email to the value in the field.    Phone Number: the value is a phone number and staff can click a button to call the number when CTI is enabled. Â            Visibility: Specified where the custom field is displayed and where the field can be edited. For more information on the visibility settings for custom fields, refer to Answer ID 1102: Visibility Options for Custom Fields. Â  Â            Notes: You can enter comments related to the custom field. "

Notifying staff of newly published or updated answers;Answer ID 1151;How do I notify staff of new answers that have been newly published to our end-user pages or recently updated?;['Answer ID 1131', 'Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 2192'];  Answers, Notifications;" With new or updated answers, you can use report subscriptions to notify staff members of answers that have been newly published or recently updated. Â You can also use answer rules to send an escalation notification to staff members when an answer is saved and meets criteria you specify.  Create a Report and Alert to send to Staff To create a report that lists newly published answers, you can first create a custom field to specify when the answer was actually published. You can then use the custom field as a criteria in a custom report. For example: First create a new custom answer field called Date Published. It should be a date type. For more information on creating custom fields, refer to Answer ID 1131: Creating Custom Fields. Â  Whenever someone publishes an answer to your end-user pages, set the date in the custom field. Â  Create a custom report with one of the criteria for the report based on the Date Published field. For example: Â  Create a filter based on Answers &gt; Date Published with the Operator set to 'between' and the date range set to -1 weeks and -0 weeks. Â  For more information on creating custom reports, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a Custom Report When you generate the report, the answers that are listed are based on the Date Published field.  You can add a report subscription to automatically send the report at a specific frequency. Note: Â You can define data exceptions within a report and then use the Alerts feature on the Scheduling tab so that the report subscription is sent only if there is data in the report. For more information, refer to Answer ID 2192: Creating and Sending Alerts.  Use Rules to Send an Escalation Notification You can use answer rules to send escalation notifications to specific staff members when an answer is saved and that answer meets the criteria specified in the rule. Note: Even though the action to include is Email &gt; Send Escalation Notification, you can use this action to simply send a notification -- even if you are not escalating the incident after a specified period of time. For example, if you want to send a notification to a staff member every time a public answer is edited, you can configured a rule as follows: IF Answer.Status equals Public (plus whatever custom public statuses you have) THEN Send Escalation Notification (and select the assignee or appropriate staff members and groups). With this rule in place, any time an answer that is a public status is saved, it will match this rule and send the notification. When setting up rules for answers, it is recommended that you include at least two rule states: an initial rule state for new records and an existing state. In this case, the rule should be for the existing state. When you compile your rule set, your answers may have a null rule state. When asked which state these null values should be assigned to, select the existing rule state."

Getting more answers than expected when searching end-user pages;Answer ID 1154;Why do results include answers that do not include the word or phrase I searched for?;['Answer ID 1309', 'Answer ID 1985', 'Answer ID 2049', 'Answer ID 566'];"   Phrase Searching  Issue   When I search our end-user pages,Ã‚Â I frequently get results that include answers that do not include the word or phrase I searched for. For example, when I search our site using the word ""indices"" in the search box, I get several answers listed, even though none of them include that word.  Also, when I search for a phrase, I get answers that do not include the whole phrase. For example, when I search on ""market share"", I get more answers than if I just search on ""market"".";"  When a search is performed in Oracle B2C Service, the application first excludes words listed in the exclude text files in the File Manager. Typically, the exclude files includes common and frequently-used words such as pronouns and prepositions, including ""your"", ""at"", and ""the"". For more information on excluding words and phrases from searches, refer to Answer ID 1309: Excluding Words from Searches Â as well as Answer ID 1985: Stopindex and Startindex Tags. The exclude_answers.txt file specifies the words to exclude when searching answers on the end-user pages or the administration pages. The exclude_incidents.txt file specifies words to exclude when searching for incidents at the Account - Questions pages or the administration pages. Common word stems: After excluding certain words from the search, the searching algorithm used by Oracle B2C Service next stems each word that remains in the search. This word-stemming method takes each remaining word of your query and stems the word back to its root component. The search is performed on the root words, which means the search results include words that have the same root word. Typically, word-stemming allows matches for words with different suffixes, such as -s, -ed, and -ing. As a result, your search results include variant forms of the words included in the search. For example, if you search on the word ""indices"", the Oracle B2C Service search feature returns ""index"" and ""indexes"" as a match for ""indices"", since the application searches on the stemmed word. Notes: The words listed in the Product and Category menus are included when searching on a word or phrase. That is, if you search on a word that is in a specific product, the answers associated to that product are returned with the search results, even if the answer does not include the word specifically. Â  You may see answers returned that do not contain your search item if one or more of the following is true:  The answers contain words that are aliases to query words. The answers contain synonyms of query words (in the case of Similar Phrases search). The answers contain keywords matching the query words.  Multiple word phrases: When multiple words are included in the Phrases search method, by default, words are joined as an OR statement, not an AND statement. This means that when you search on a phrase such as ""market share"", the search results include answers that include both ""market"" and ""share"" as well as answers that only include ""market"" and answers that include only ""share"". Typically, answers that include both words are listed towards the top of the list. Answers that include only one of the words generally appear lower in the list since they are not usually as strong a match. If you want to search for answers that include both ""market"" and ""share"", use a + before each word, namely ""+market +share"". The plus sign indicates that the word must be in the answer in order for it to be returned in the search results. You can specify whether multiple words should be joined with an OR connector or an AND connector. For more information on this, refer to Answer ID 2049: Searching with an AND Join Between Multiple Word Phrases. For more information on the different search types used in Oracle B2C Service, refer to Answer ID 566: Search Options on the End-user Pages."

Routing chat requests to agents;Answer ID 1174;How do chat requests get routed to agents?;['Answer ID 8179', 'Answer ID 8178', 'Answer ID 6523', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Chat, Agent, Business Rules;"  When a chat is submitted by an end user it is inserted into the ""Default Chat Queue"" unless first acted upon by chat rules used to route the chat to another queue. If chat rules are in place, the chat is routed to the specific chat queue specified in the rule. Chat rules are different than incident rules. Once the chat has been routed to its proper queue, the chat will follow the process outlined here to be assigned to an agent. The assignment of chat will occur using a specific algorithm. When a chat request is made the system creates two lists:  Â  Â  Â 1. Â  A list of waiting chats, and  Â  Â  Â 2.  Â A list of available agents with at least 1 available chat session The list of waiting chats is sorted by longest wait time; therefore the oldest chat is served first. The list of available agents is sorted based on the last assignment time of the agent session. If agents are logged in and haven't had any chats during their session, each agent has an equal chance of receiving the first chat that comes in, regardless of the order in which the agents logged in. Once each agent has accepted a chat, then the router will assign the chat based on which agent has the oldest request for a chat. The longest waiting chat is assigned to the agent with the oldest outstanding request for a chat.  The chat assignment algorithm takes the following into consideration:  The time a chat session was requested by the end user   The time the agent was last assigned a chat session   Whether the Pull Policy on the profile is set for First Due or Strict Priority. For more information on Pull Policy, Â please see Answer ID 8179: Understanding Chat Permissions: Chat Queue Pull Policy. Â   The chat assignment algorithm does not take the following into consideration:  Whether the Profile is set for PUSH or PULL Chat Mode. For more information on Push and Pull Chat Modes, please see Answer ID 8178: Understanding Chat Permissions: Pull Chat Mode and Push Mode.   The number of sessions an agent has available. The system does not proactively distribute the next chat to the agent with the most available chat slots.  Helpful examples for understanding the chat assignment algorithm:  All agents login at the same time, all are available, none have taken a chat, then one of the agents will receive a chat session. Agent A has handled 1 chat, Agent B has handled zero chats, then the next chat in the queue will be assigned to Agent B. Agent A has handled 10 chats, Agent B has handled 5 chats, Agent C has newly entered the queue and is available, then the next chat in the queue will be assigned to Agent C. All agents have the same profile with max chats set to 3. Agent A is currently handling max chats/has no sessions available, Agent B has one active chat that was assigned at 8:10, Agent C has one active chat that was assigned at 8:15, then the next chat in the queue will be assigned to Agent B. Agent A has two active chats where one was assigned at 8:05 and the other at 8:15, Agent B has one active chat that was assigned at 8:10, then the next chat in the queue will be assigned to Agent B.  The Chat Assignment Algorithm and the Ignore Preroute attribute: Please Note: If the conditional chat link (syndicated or standard) is deployed and the ignore_preroute attribute is enabled (set to 'yes'), then customers may be routed to a different queue than the one originally determined by agent availability (even a queue for which no agent is immediately available). This can conflict with the indication of availability expressed by the widget itself, leading to customer confusion. For this reason, the ignore_preroute attribute should be enabled only when necessary for achieving a specific business goal. For more information, refer to Answer ID 6523: Chat rules not working with ConditionalChatLink.

Effect on incidents and answers when moving or deleting products or categories;Answer ID 1179;What happens if we eliminate a product or category and there are answers and incidents assigned to that item?;['Answer ID 645'];  Products, Categories, Answers, Incidents Issue  We need to delete a product and category, but haveÃ‚Â answers and incidents assigned to them.Ã‚Â  We need to assess the impact or effort of re-association prior to removing them.Ã‚Â ;"  Changing the Order of Products or Categories If you are simply changing the display order of your products or categories and drag and drop the item to a new location in the list, incidents and answers retain their product and category association. In addition, if you change the order of sub-products that are listed under the same product (or sub-categories listed under a common category), incidents and answers keep their product and sub-product or category and sub-category association.  Moving Sub-Items to Be Parent Items Incidents and answers behave differently if you are moving a sub-item to be a parent or a parent to be a sub. This includes the following actions: Moving a sub-product to be a product value Moving a product to be a sub-product Moving a sub-product to be a sub-product for a different product value Â   Â  Moving a sub-category to be a category Moving a category to be a sub-category Moving a sub-category to be a sub-category for a different category value.  Incidents: Incidents retain their relationship to the sub-item involved (the item being moved). For example, if an incident is assigned to the product / sub-product combination Printers / LaserJet and LaserJet is moved to be its own product, the incident will now be associated with the product LaserJet. Similarly, if an incident is assigned to a product named Digital Cameras and that product is moved to be a sub-product under Photography, the incident will be associated with Photography / Digital Cameras. Answers: Answers are affected differently depending on which version your site is on. It is recommended to perform testing in a test environment to confirm results prior to making production changes. When you move an item, the answer retains the relationship to that item. Â  That is, if an answer is assigned to a product and that product is moved to be a sub-product, the answer is assigned to the sub-product. Â  Similarly, if an answer is assigned to a sub-product and it is moved to a different parent, the answer retains it's association with the sub-product. This behavior is the same when using Knowledge Advanced. Deleting Products or Categories You cannot delete a product if any answers are associated with it. Â  A Dependency Conflict error will come up and the operation will be aborted. Â  You must associate the answers to Â other products before you can delete it. If a product or category is deleted, any incidents (resolved and unresolved) Â that are associated with that value will be reset to 'No Value' for that value. Â  Â If you would like the incidents to be associated with a different product or category they will need to be re-assigned. If a sub-product or category is deleted, the incident will retain its association to the top level product or category. For additional information on editing and deleting products and categories, refer to Answer ID 645: Adding, editing, or removing Service products or categories Deleting Products or Categories when using Knowledge Advanced Â  If your site is using Knowledge Advanced, the behavior is a little different. Products or categories can be deleted if they have articles associated with them, as the visibility of articles is controlled by the view(s) associated with the content. As a best practice, prior to deleting a product or category review the ""Answers by Product"" or ""Answers by Category"" report as appropriate. Â Then, modify the products or categories associated with those articles and only delete the product or category once there are no more articles associated with it."

Duplicate incidents are being created;Answer ID 1206;Often when a customer sends an email to our support mailbox, duplicate incidents are created within the application.;['Answer ID 645'];   Incident Routing Oracle B2C Service;  Incidents Created from Ask a Question Page  Duplicate or even triplicate incidents can be created from the Ask a Question page if an end-user clicks the Submit Question or Finish Submitting Question button more than once. In these cases, the content of the incidents will be identical, but the reference number and the timestamp of when the incidents were created will be different. In cases where multiple incidents are created this way, only one notification will be sent to the assigned staff member since all of the incidents are submitted from the same session. Only the first notification will be sent.  Incidents Created from Email Submittals  When techmail runs, a lock file is put in place to prevent a second occurrence of techmail to run against the mailbox. As a result, there should never be an instance of techmail running twice against your mailbox. Even though there is a lock, duplicate incidents can be created if identical emails exist in the mailbox at the same time during the techmail run. This happens as the checks for duplicates run against the database. Since the emails are identical and have not been committed to the database at this point, both emails will create incidents. Another possibility for duplicates is if the EGW_DISCARD_DUPLICATE_ENABLED Â configuration setting is disabled. Â  This setting allows you to discard emails that are determined to be duplicates. If enabled, any email having the same date within four hours, to and from email address (i.e. Sent to the same mailbox from the same sender), subject, and body as an existing incident will be classified as a duplicate message and will be discarded. Default is enabled (Yes). Â  If, however, this setting has been disabled, this would then allow duplicate email messages to create duplicate incidents. NOTE: Beginning in the May 2015 release, the file attachment name, type, and size is also considered when processing potential duplicate messages. Â  Â In this same version, the specific mailbox is now ignored as a true duplicate could be sent to multiple configured mailboxes.

Searching differences between answers and incidents;Answer ID 1222;Why are the searching options different when searching for answers than when searching for incidents in the administrative console?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 645'];Phrase Searching;" Answer searching By default, the end-user pages include the four search techniques listed below, which provide for a range of knowledge and skill levels among users:  Phrases: basic word-stemmed searching Â    Exact Phrases: searching for a set of exact words (does not support logical operators) Â    Similar Phrases: searching using approximate phrases, such as misspelled words Â    Complex Expression: word-stemmed searching for partial phrases using logical operators and wildcards  All four of these methods are available for use on the administrative pages when searching for answers -- Â primarily because they are available to your site visitors as well. This allows your knowledge engineers the same search functionality that is available to your end-users. Phrases, exact phrases, and similar phrases searching are generally less powerful than complex expression searching, and are geared more toward end-users. Having Â these search options available on the administration pages Â helps a knowledge engineer determine how well end-users will be able to find certain answers, by testing for seeded keywords, for example. Incident searching: With incidents, the Summary/Thread (search_thread) Â search option uses the complex expression search method. This is Â is Â the same technique available as a selection when searching for answers. The complex expression method is the only technique that supports wildcard searching. Word-stemming and logical operators are also supported. This makes complex expression searching the most complete and versatile of the searching options. It is due to this versatility that it is used as the default Â search technique for searching the Summary fields and discussion thread of incidents. By restricting the search Â options available with incidents, the phrases table is significantly reduced in size which allows for quicker search functionality. If you would like to approximate multi-word phrase searching (exact phrase searching) with incidents, use a plus sign prior to each word in the phrase, for example, +firstword +nextword +lastword. This search will result in all incidents that include all three of the words listed. If you choose a different operator such as ""Not Equals"" Â the report will still run as if ""complex expression"" was chosen, also Â if you want to negate a search word that you can do so by adding a negative symbol ""-"" to the word. Â  Â For instance if you search on: -thisword The search will only return incidents that do not include ""thisword""  Note: A Â description of the search techniques can be found on the Advanced Search window by clicking the 'Search Tips' link."

Testing escalation rules;Answer ID 1231;How can I test my escalation rules?;['Answer ID 1873', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Business Escalation Rules;" If you wish to test escalation rules, you must submit a test incident that matches the criteria of your escalation rules and let the incident escalate through the ruleset. To test the rules initially, you can modify the timeframe called out in the escalation process so that the incident will escalate in minutes rather than hours or days. This will allow you to verify that the incident hits the correct rules during the escalation process and that the correct actions occur during the escalation. You can use the Rule Log to verify that the incident matched the appropriate rule or rules. For more information on using the Rule Log, refer to Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log. Then, after you have verified the rules are acting and escalating records appropriately, modify the rules so that they use the appropriate time for escalating the records. For additional information, refer to the 'Escalating answers, incidents, opportunities, and task' section in online documentation (under Core Features &gt; Business Rules Management) for the version your site is currently running.

Options for removing older incidents without deleting them from our site;Answer ID 1234;What options are available for removing older incidents from searching without removing them from our site?;['Answer ID 7038', 'Answer ID 10293', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 4316'];   Archiving, Dormant, Purging Oracle B2C Service, all versions  Issue   We have so many incidents that when we search through our incidents, we get too many old incidents returned which makes it difficult to find the record we are looking for.;"  Oracle RightNow Â Cloud Service includes two primary features for managing older incidents in your database:  The Dormant feature allows you to exclude incidents from searching while retaining them in the database.   The Archiving feature allows you to remove older, resolved incidents from the database (which also aids performance since the size of your database decreases). Archived incidents are converted to an XML file that can be accessed for viewing and reference, but the content for the archived incidents is removed from the database tables.  Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  Â  Dormant Incidents  Over time, as the number of incidents in your Â database increases, the dormant incident feature allows you to flag older, solved incidents as dormant so that they can be excluded from general searching at the Support Console. Setting older incidents as dormant allows you to keep the incidents in your site, but allows you to exclude the dormant incidents when searching incidents on the administrative page. This allows you to improve the speed and accuracy Â when searching for incidents. Note: By default, dormant incidents are included for searching at the My Stuff - Questions page so that end-users can access their historical incidents for reference. Attachments to incidents are stored as well, when you open a dormant incident you will have the ability to view the attachment. The DORMANT_INCIDENTS  Â configuration setting specifies the number of days after which Solved incidents will go dormant by the agedatabase utility. Set this value to Â 0 (zero) Â or to a value greater than the incident purge days setting to disable this feature. By default, this feature is set to 0 which means incidents are never flagged as dormant. To further clarify how the two configuration settings work together, if both are enabled (i.e. DORMANT_INCIDENTS and incident purge), then, setting the dormant value greater than the purge value will be ineffective because closed incidents will be purged before they reach the dormancy date. Â  Â However, you can use the dormant setting independent of the purge setting (i.e. you can leave the purge setting off). Path to DORMANT_INCIDENTS setting: Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. NOTE:  The DORMANT_INCIDENTS setting is interface specific and not site specific. You can configure and enable incident purging from Data Lifecycle Policies component in Browser Agent.  When an incident is set to dormant, the keywords for that incident are flagged in the phrases table and excluded from searching on the administrative side. If a dormant incident is edited or updated, the dormancy flag is cleared, and the incident is available through phrase searches. When the dormant feature is utilized, you can specify whether to include dormant incidents in your incident searches based on other characteristics than the phrases in that incident. That is, you can include dormant incidents when searching by reference number, status, or other field information. You can add the incidents.dormant field as a filter in your incident reports. Set the default for the field to No so that only non-dormant incidents are searched. Â  When configured this way, by default, only non-dormant incidents will be included in search results. However, since the field is a run-time filter, you can click the Search icon to search for dormant incidents if you wish. Note: Text searches Â do not apply for dormant incidents, but other characteristics such as reference number, assigned to, or custom field information can be used to search for dormant incidents.   Â  Archiving Incidents  Â   You have the additional option of archiving older incidents. Archived incidents are actually removed from the database and stored in a separate file. When an incident is archived, it is no longer searchable in the application, but can still be accessed through the Incident Archive feature.  Archived Incidents item is only available if incident archiving has been enabled and incidents have been archived. Â  The Archived Incidents item can be added to a staff member's navigation set along with other reports. Â  Refer to Answer ID 7038: How to access and use the archive console Â for more information.  Important! Archiving incidents is an irreversible process. Once an incident has been archived, the only way to restore it as an active incident in your site is to manually re-create the incident Â in the console. To enable incident archiving for Â August 2012 and releases prior to 18B: Â The ARCHIVE_INCIDENTS configuration setting specifies the number of days after which solved incidents will be archived. Starting from 18B, incident archiving conditions and enablement needs to be done from Data Lifecycle Policies component in Browser Agent.  Â Refer to Using Data Lifecycle Policy to purge (or archive) for additional information on steps to get started on Data Lifecycle Management framework. Â  To disable archiving, set ARCHIVE_INCIDENTS to zero (0) or disable archive incidents Data Lifecycle Policy in Data Lifecycle Policies Â component in Browser Agent depending on the site release versions. Warning:  Purge Incidents period may conflict with this setting.  Â If Purge Incidents setting is both non-zero (ex 90) and less than the value of archive incidents settings (ex 365), then archive incidents period is effectively ignored and incidents will instead be deleted.  Â Any time archive incidents period is modified, it is advised to also review purge incidents period.   Enabling incident archiving may cause data to be irretrievably converted to a read-only format and will affect certain standard reports and all custom reports. Please review this setting description and the documentation carefully prior to turning on incident archiving.  Â Verify that the functionality provided by Incident Archiving will be adequate for the solved incidents older than the intended threshold.  Before you can archive incidents, you must determine which incidents you want to archive and configure interface archiving. The incidents table and threads table are reduced in size when incidents are archived. When archiving is enabled, the incidents that meet the archiving criteria -- incidents with a solved status type that have been solved for the time period specified are removed from the incidents table. The archived incidents are converted into a flat XML file that is stored on the server. After the incidents are removed from the incidents table, a row is inserted into the archived_incidents table for each archived incident. This insertion includes a field that contains the path to the flat XML file for that incident. In addition, key information related to the incident is also inserted, including the contact ID value, when the incident was created and closed, the reference number, title, incident ID, interface ID and the date of the last response. Â  Â Attachments are still available. Â  Â They still reside on the attachments server and are accessible. Please note: In order to access file attachments on an archived incident, there is a section on the 'Details' tab. Any file attachments associated to the incident will be at the bottom of the page. You will be able to click the link and the file will open. For additional information, refer to the 'Archiving Incidents Automatically' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Allowing staff to re-edit the incident thread before sending response;Answer ID 1243;Is there an option to allow staff in training to re-open an incident and edit response text they had previously entered?;['Answer ID 1292', 'Answer ID 2518'];   Workspaces / Incident Response  Issue   We have staff in training who will enterÃ‚Â response text. Once a coach reviews that, they may need to re-open the incident and edit that response text again prior to send it to the customer.;"  You can Â allow staff members to save incidents without sending a response and then later re-open the incident and be able to edit the content that they had previously entered. This is within the incident workspace. Â  From the Design ribbon &gt; Response Options, you can configure their workspace to:  a) Not commit the thread when an incident is saved -- set Commit Response When Incident is Saved to False / disabled Â  Â   Â  Â  b) Not change the status of the incident from unresolved so that incidents are not inadvertently closed -- set Change the IncidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Status when Send On Save is Selected to No Change Â  Â   Â  Â  c) Not have the Send on Save box enabled by default -- set Automatically Select Send On Save When Opening an Incident Default to Never  In addition, determine whether an incident should automatically be reassigned to a staff member who opens the incident for editing. The Reassign the Incident When Send On Save is Selected property allows you to specify whether the incident is automatically reassigned to the agent editing the incident or becomes unassigned or does not change assignment.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Several workspace properties associated with the Rich Text Incident Thread relationship item affect the functionality associated with saving and sending responses for incidents. These properties are listed under the Response Options button in the Design ribbon; this button becomes visible on the Design ribbon when the incident thread portion of the workspace has ""focus"", i.e. it has been clicked on. Â  Â A simple way to do this is click the Send On Save or text areas of the incident thread workspace editor.  1. Confirm Response When Saving and Send On Save is Selected Select this option if you want the staff member to confirm that the incident response should be sent.  2. Commit Response When Incident is Saved Select this option if you want the staff response to be committed to the incident thread when the response is saved. This property specifies when a staff response in an incident is committed to the incident thread. If this property is TRUE, the response is committed when an incident is saved -- even if the response is not sent. If set to FALSE, the response is committed to the thread only if a response is sent to the end-user. That is, if set to FALSE, an agent can add a response and save the incident (without sending a response) and the agent can re-open the incident and edit that thread. By default, this is set to TRUE. Once the response is sent to the end-user, it becomes committed to the incident thread and the staff member cannot edit it. Note: Â  If you try to solve an incident with an uncommitted thread, a pop-up window displays indicating that this is not allowed. Â  See Answer ID 2192: Committing content to the incident thread Â &gt; 'Uncommitted content' section for more information.  3. Add a Response When Selecting Send On Save if No Response Already Exists Select this option to automatically display the response options panel when you select the Send on Save check box on the Rich Text Incident Thread control. Clearing the check box closes the response options. Additionally, when this property is enabled, clicking the slider on the Messages tab to open the response options panel automatically selects the Send on Save check box, and closing the response options clears the check box. If this option is disabled, then expanding the response options panel enables the Send on Save box, but clicking the Send on Save box does not automatically expand the panel. Clearing the Send on Save check box automatically collapses the panel, but collapsing the panel does not automatically clear the Send on Save check box.  4. Reassign the Incident When Send On Save is Selected Click this drop-down menu and select one of the following options for reassigning an incident when a response is sent. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ No ChangeÃ¢â‚¬â€The incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Assigned field does not change. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ To Current AgentÃ¢â‚¬â€The Assigned field changes to the staff member working the incident. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ To UnassignedÃ¢â‚¬â€The Assigned field is set to No Value.  5. Automatically Select Send On Save When Opening an Incident Click this drop-down menu and select an option that indicates when an incident response should be sent automatically. The options are: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ NeverÃ¢â‚¬â€A response is never sent automatically. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ On NewÃ¢â‚¬â€A response is sent for a new incident. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ On EditÃ¢â‚¬â€A response is sent when an incident is edited. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ On New and EditÃ¢â‚¬â€A response is sent whenever an incident is added or edited. Note: To automatically select the Send on Save check box only when sending a response, an agent can click the slider bar at the left of the incident thread and enter the response using the response options section. Refer to Sending responses.  Â  Â  6. Change the IncidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Status when Send On Save is Selected Click this drop-down menu and select an option for changing an incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status when a response is sent. The options are: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ No ChangeÃ¢â‚¬â€The incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status does not change when a response is sent. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ To WaitingÃ¢â‚¬â€The incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status changes to Waiting when a response is sent. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ To SolvedÃ¢â‚¬â€The incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status changes to Solved when a response is sent.

Impact of indexing a custom field;Answer ID 1266;What is the Indexed check box when adding or editing certain types of custom fields?;['Answer ID 4494'];   Custom Fields, Field Indexing;"  When creating or editing a custom field, the Indexed check-box specifies whether an index for the custom field should be created in the appropriate database table. That is, indexed incident custom fields have indexes on the incidents table; indexed contacts custom fields have indexes on the contacts table, and indexed answer custom fields have indexes on the answers table. Note: Â You can also specify whether your answer variables should be indexed. Â  This option is not available with the Opt-in and Yes/No data types. The purpose of an index is to speed up record searches when searching by the indexed field. For example, if you have an incident custom field called language, and you frequently search your knowledge base for all incidents related to a specific language, you would want this custom field indexed to improve search performance. There are also drawbacks to having custom fields indexed. Specifying too many indexes on a specific table can degrade search performance rather than improve it. In general, it is best to have fewer than 15 total fields indexed in any given table. The incidents table is most likely to be adversely affected by too many indexes. However, the answers, organizations, and contacts tables can also experience poor performance due to too many indexes. Each table has some fields indexed by default. In addition, our Cloud Operations group may add custom indexes to specific fields to improve site performance. The best general rule of thumb when indexing custom fields is to have fewer than 10 additional custom fields indexed for a given type of custom field (answer, incident, customer, or company). In addition, too many table indexes can disrupt the site update process. If your site has too many indexes on any one table, a variety of failures may occur--including problems when updating. For additional information on Â when fields may benefit from indexing please review Answer ID 4494: When to index a custom field"

Agents get disconnected when using Oracle Service Chat;Answer ID 1270;When we use Oracle Service ChatÃ‚Â and are either idle or actively chatting, we get disconnected within a few minutes.;['Answer ID 31'];  Oracle Service Chat Oracle B2C Service; Two different situations may explain why you and your staff get disconnected, depending on whether you are disconnected at consistent time intervals or at inconsistent intervals.  Disconnected at Consistent Time Intervals If you and your staff get disconnected from Oracle Service Chat at consistent intervals, e.g. every 5 minutes, contact your firewall administrator and inform them a firewall timeout is disconnecting your chat sessions every 'x' minutes. The firewall administrator needs to make modifications to port 80 to prevent this from happening.  Disconnected at Inconsistent Time Intervals If you and your staff are disconnected at inconsistent time intervals, e.g. sometimes 7 minutes, sometimes 9 minutes, sometimes 15 minutes, contact your proxy administrator and let them know that chat sessions are being disconnected at inconsistent time intervals. The proxy administrator needs to make modifications to the proxy server so that all traffic destined for your live server is bypassed by the proxy.

Using your organization's domain in the Sent email address as your Oracle B2C Service mailbox;Answer ID 1272;"How can we have our company's domain name in the ""Sent"" email address instead of the ""@custhelp.com""?";['Answer ID 2701', 'Answer ID 2700', 'Answer ID 5168'];"   Mailboxes, Service and Outreach, Incoming Email, SMTP forward  Issue   We have an Oracle-managed mailbox used to process Service email requests submitted by our customers. We wantÃ‚Â our company's domain name to showÃ‚Â in the ""Sent"" email address instead of the ""@mail&lt;pod&gt;.custhelp.com"" when the email is initially sent and when our customers reply to subsequent emails we send them.";"  It is possible to redirect email from your mailbox to the hosted mailbox and to also retain the Reply-To address for your own domain. To do this, there are a couple of steps to follow: 1. First, the Friendly From/Branded Address field of the mailbox you are looking to brand needs to be modified, so that emails sent from Oracle B2C Service to look like they are coming from your corporate domain (i.e. From: support@yourdomain.com).    2. To avoid emails being rejected by the recipients due to authentication issues, DomainKeys and DKIM authentication will need to be setup. Please refer to DomainKeys and DKIM email authentication configuration. With this setup, when your customers submit email to the SMTP forwarding account that contains your domain name, your system will redirect the email messages to the hosted mailbox, where they are processed by Techmail and turned into incidents. Â When you respond to one of these incidents, your end-users see the name of your own mailbox in the Reply-To field. However, when your customers will reply in their mail client to these emails they got, they will see the @custhelp.com address. To have change this so it is Â also support@yourdomain.com, continue with the next steps 3. Your IT group must configure an SMTP forwarding mail account to redirect messages to the hosted mailbox. For example support@yourdomain.com would be forwarded to support@mailmw.custhelp.com. 4. Go to Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes and set the Reply-To address field for the hosted mailbox to the SMTP forwarding account your IT group configured.   With all four steps complete, Â when your customers will click reply in their mail client to the emails they got from you, they will see support@yourdomain.com. Note: The Envelope From / Bounce Address field for the hosted mailbox (Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes) Â should remain the address of the hosted mailbox, Â for example Â support@mailmw.custhelp.com, so that bounce messages are handled correctly. For more details about the benefits of the Â mail system that Oracle Â Service Cloud Â has deployed, refer to Oracle B2C Service email deployment.

Click to Enlarge: Standard Text Page When creating or editing a standard text response, click the $ icon on the right to select a Â table and eligible fields from the database. The database field, in the variable format, will be appended to the standard response. Then, when that standard text response is appended to an incident response field and the incident response is sent, the variable is replaced with the actual content of that field from the database. For example, click the $ icon and select Contacts &gt; First Name from the menu. The system variable is appended to the standard response. When the standard text response is then appended to the incident thread, you initially see the actual variable format. However, when the response is sent, the variable is replaced with the contact's first name. Additional fields, such as Incident &gt; Assigned, Contacts &gt; User ID, and even custom fields may be included in standard responses using these system variables."

Existing customers having difficulty logging in to site;Answer ID 1283;Why are existing customers having difficulty logging in to our site?;['Answer ID 383'];  Customer login to end-user customer portal;" End-users may have difficulty logging in to the Login page in some cases if they have entered their User ID and email address in different cases. If you have edited your end-user pages to encourage your site visitors to enter their email address as their User ID, keep in mind that there are still two distinct fields being used -- the User ID field, which is case sensitive and the Email Address field, which saves email addresses in all lowercase letters. Note: It is not possible to make the User ID field insensitive to the case used. What can happen is that an end-user creates a contact record by entering an email address that includes capital letters, such Jane_Smith@MyCompany.com. If this value is entered in both the User ID and Email Address fields, it will be saved in the customer record as: User ID: Jane_Smith@MyCompany.com Email Address: jane_smith@mycompany.com In this case, if Jane returns to log in to the Login, she must enter the value specified in the User ID field  Â in order to successfully log in or request the account password. In this case, Jane must enter ""Jane_Smith@MyCompany.com"" to log in successfully or to request the password to be sent. If she tries to log in using ""jane_smith@mycompany.com"", she will be denied access and she will not be able to have her login password emailed to herself. At that point, due to the difficulty of trying to log in, many end-users will try to create a new account. However, if they try to use the same email address, they will receive the account creation failed message because their email address is already used in the Email Address field for the initial account. To investigate this: From the administrative pages, search for the contact record by the email address. Next, view the contact record to see the entries for the User ID and Email Address fields. To successfully log in, the customer MUST enter the values specified in the User ID and Password fields -- and these are both case-sensitive fields. Once you find the contact record, you can provide the specific log in information to that customer or edit the record if the customer indicates the desire to do so. If you have edited the User ID message base to encourage end-users to use their email address as their User ID, you may want to edit the message base further to indicate that the field is case-sensitive. In this way, your site visitors are more inclined to enter their User ID correctly each time they visit your site. For more information on editing message bases, refer to Answer ID 383: Determining Which Message Base to Edit."

All email addresses are invalidated on an upgrade or test site;Answer ID 1288;Why do all email addresses have .invalid appended to them on our upgradeÂ and test site?;['Answer ID 2145'];  All Implementations; When an upgrade or test site Â is created, all email addresses are appended with .invalid. This causes all email addresses within your upgrade or test Â site to become invalid so that no reports, closed service request messages, or answer notifications are sent to actual customers from the test environment. This can also impact form submission from the Ask a Question page. This is a compromise between having real data in the test site and ensuring that the test site does not impact live production sites. All email addresses in the system, both staff accounts and contacts, are modified. This only occurs once, when the upgrade site is created. When your production site is cutover to the new version of Oracle B2C Service, the values from your production site are carried forward into the upgraded site. To test email functionality on the upgrade or test Â site, remove the .invalid extension from any email address that you want to use for test purposes. Notes: Mailboxes are disabled by default on the upgrade site. Refer to Answer 2145: Testing emailed responses from the upgrade site Â for additional information.

Committing content to the incident thread;Answer ID 1292;At times I want to add an item to a discussion thread without sending a message to the customer.;['Answer ID 1332'];   Incident Thread Entries Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  The easiest way to accomplish this is to create a Private Note, not a response. Â  End-users cannot see Private Notes. Â  When adding content to an incident thread as a response, your application can be configured to either commit the content when the incident is saved (regardless of whether a response is sent) or to commit the content only when the response is sent. As a minimum, the content is committed when it is sent to the end-user as a response to the incident. Â This ensures that the exact communication to the Â end-user is retained within the incident.  Committed content: Once the content is committed to the thread, it is no longer editable from the incident workspace.  Â  However, beginning in 18C, it is possible to edit or remove text and images from incident threads using the 'Incident Thread Correction' administrative function. Â Prior to 18C, it is only possible to convert response threads to notes. Â For more information on using the Incident Thread Correction feature, refer to Answer ID 1332: Editing the Thread of an Incident.  Uncommitted content: If your site allows uncommitted content within the Response field, a staff member can save the incident without sending a response. Â  When the incident is re-opened the content in the Response field is still editable so that the agent can continue working and editing the response before sending it. Then, when the response is sent, that Â response is committed to the thread. If an incident has an uncommitted thread in the response field, you cannot set the incident to the Waiting or Solved status. An uncommitted thread infers that there is still work in progress, and Oracle B2C Service does not allow incidents to be closed when there is an indication that the issue is not fully resolved. If you try to solve an incident with an uncommitted thread, a pop-up window displays indicating that this is not allowed. At that point, you may choose to:  Send the response to the customer Delete the uncommitted response from the Response field in the incident Copy the uncommitted response to the Notes field as an indication of the content.  Workspace Options: Within an incident workspace, the Commit Response On Save property associated with the Incident Thread relationship item specifies when content entered as a response to an incident is committed to the thread.  If the Commit Response On Save property is set to True (enabled), the content of a response is committed to the thread when an incident is saved -- even if the content was not actually sent as a response.   If the property is set to False (disabled), the content is committed to the thread only when it is sent as a response Â to the end-user. Â If the incident is saved without a response, the content of the Response field is uncommitted. Â  When the agent opens the incident later, they can edit that thread until it is sent as a response.  To edit the workspace property, use the steps below. If the staff account uses a default workspace, you must copy it, Â edit the copy, and then update the staff profile to use the copy.  From the staff account, Â  Â determine which profile is used. Â    From the staff profile, click the Service tab to determine which incident workspace is used. Â    Open the incident workspace and click the Incident Thread relationship item (by default, it is on the Messages tab). Â    Review the value for the Commit Response On Save property. If necessary, change the value and save the workspace.  Â  This property is listed under the Response Options button on the Design tab.

Keywords field when editing answers;Answer ID 1301;When creating or editing an answer, what is the Keywords field used for?;['Answer ID 1995'];"  Answers &gt; Keywords";" The Keywords field allows you to enter additional words and phrases that do not appear in the Summary, Question, or Answer fields for that answer, but are still closely related to the content of the answer. This could include synonyms for words in the answer or abbreviations and acronyms. When additional words and phrases are added to the Keywords field, the answer will be listed when a search is performed using that keyword or phrase. Any keywords and phrases you enter in the Keywords field are given the greatest weight (by default) in determining matches when an end-user searches on the Find Answers page. The keywords are also used when the answers are clustered for use with the browse feature. The maximum length of a keyword is 25 characters. Any word longer than 25 characters is excluded as a keyword, and is therefore not searchable. In addition, as with other searching options, keyword searching is not sensitive to whether the text is upper or lowercase. Important Note: When adding keywords and phrases to an answer, multiple entries MUST be separated by commas. Failure to include items in a comma-separated list could result in improper search results and performance issues. By adding keywords and phrases, you can include synonyms and additional terminology that your end-users may use when searching for items. For example, your company may call a customer's submittal for assistance a ""trouble report"", and based on that, one of your answers is ""How do I submit a trouble report?"" Since new customers may not use that specific term, they may search on a variety of words and phrases. In this case, you could enter the following items in the Keywords field: incident, assistance request, service request, help By adding these words and phrases, the desired answer ""How do I submit a trouble report?"" would appear in the search results even when the end-user did not search specifically for ""trouble report"" and instead searched on a word or phrase in the Keywords list. Words listed in the Keywords field are stemmed to the root word or component. As a result, you do not need to enter words that differ only in the suffixes used, i.e. take, takes, taking, taken. Aliasing: Â You can define aliases that are used throughout your published answers. That way, you do not need to add groups of keywords to several individual answers. For more information on created aliases, refer to Answer ID 1995: Using a list of common aliases and keywords for all answers."

Using a custom splash page for site maintenance and updates;Answer ID 1306;Can I have a custom splash page displayed for site maintenance and updates?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Customer Portal pages (CP), All versions;"  You do have an option to Â upload a custom splash page. Â  Â  The general splash page provided by Oracle Â is used automatically, and displays a message stating, ""This site is undergoing maintenance."" Â   This general splash page provided by Oracle Â is in English - even if your interface has a non-English language pack applied. Â If you want the text to be in Â a Â language other than English Â (e.g., French or German), you must upload a custom splash page Â for that interface. If you have multiple interfaces and wish to have a custom splash page for each interface, you will need to upload a separate custom splash.html file for each interface separately. During an update, the updated splash page needs to be uploaded to both the production site and the upgrade site prior to the cutover to show the page for the entire duration of cutover down time. The reason being that at the beginning of cutover, the copy on the production site is displayed. During the cutover the version on the upgrade site is copied to the production site and displayed.  Customer Portal Required Changes:  Modify the HTML code for the splash.html file and upload it to your Customer Portal site. Â   Customer Portal framework 3.x.x: cp/customer/error/splash.html Customer Portal framework 2: euf/config/splash.html  The URL for the splash.html page is below. http://&lt;interfacename&gt;.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/&lt;interfacename&gt;.cfg/php/euf/config/splash.html If you have uploaded a custom splash.html file, this URL will display the page as it will appear to your end-users when your site is in maintenance mode. Â  Â Otherwise, the default splash.html page is used. If an upgrade site exists, the URL for the splash.html page is: http://&lt;interfacename&gt;--upgrade.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/&lt;interfacename&gt;.cfg/php/euf/config/splash.html   Notes: When promoting changes to your production site, you can Â manually turn the splash page on and off to reserve time for any post-promotion tasks. A configuration setting called ""CP_MAINTENANCE_MODE_ENABLED"" can be utilized so that all page requests within Production mode in Customer Portal will return the content of the splash.html page and all syndicated widgets will stop displaying data. This will not affect WebDAV, the CP admin area, custom controller endpoints, Â or requests within development or staging mode. Consequently, Â administrators Â can test or change Customer Portal before allowing it to be Â viewed by the Â end-users. To manually turn on the splash page:  1. Â  Login to the Oracle B2C Service console. 2. Â  Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. 3. Â  Double-click Configuration Settings under Site Configuration. 4.  Â Search by Key &gt; CP_MAINTENANCE_MODE_ENABLED. 5. Â  Select the Yes radio button and click Save. 6. Â  Visitors to your production site will continue to see the splash page until you reset CP_MAINTENANCE_MODE_ENABLED to No.  For additional information, refer to the 'Turn On the Splash Page' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Excluding specific words or phrases from searching;Answer ID 1309;How do I exclude specific words or phrases from being included in a search?;['Answer ID 1660'];   Word List files, Incident and Answer Phrase searching;"  The files listed below affect which words are excluded from keyword searching and which words are included in similar phrase searching. Words excluded from searches are often referred to as stopwords.          You can add and remove Stopwords from the list by going to Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Knowledge Base &gt; Answer Stopwords / Incident Stopwords         The exclude_incidents.txt file contains common words such as prepositions that are excluded from natural language searches Â with incidents in Oracle B2C Service. This affects searching for incidents at the Support Console and on the Account - Support History page.           The  Â  exclude_answers.txt file contains the common words that are excluded from searching on the end-user Answers pages and at the Answer Console.           The Â  thesaurus.txt file includes groups of synonyms used when using the Similar Phrases searching option. By editing this file, you can define specific groups of synonyms to use.      In addition, the smartsense.txt file allows you to add emotive words to be used with the SmartSense emotive indexing feature. You can add unrated words to this list to expand the emotive indexing function for your specific application. Changes to this file affect new and updated incidents and new Â chat sessions. Existing incidents are not affected by changes to this file. Multiple interfaces: Â  Within the File Manager, files located in the wordlist menu are not interface specific. Each file is language specific. Â  That is, if two interfaces in your site have the same language pack applied, those interfaces share the same wordlist files. Â  For example, if two interfaces both have the en_US language pack applied, if you add words to the answers_exclude.txt file for one interface, those words are also excluded from searching in the other interface that uses the en_US language.  To Update a Word List File:  These files are accessible using the File Manager. To access and update these files use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select System Configuration &gt; File Manager. Â    Select Wordlist Files from the Switch to drop-down menu. Â Please note, there are three options to choose from:  wordlist files Â  wordlist - backup wordlist - default  Only ""wordlist files"" can be edited. The other two files are not directly editable and do not have the option to save.   Click the appropriate file name to open the file. Â    Edit the file accordingly:  Â  Entries must be entered in all capital letters.  If editing the exclude_answers.txt, exclude_incidents.txt, nlp_exclude.txt, or nlp_faqexclude.txt files, additional words to be excluded are entered with one word per line (carriage-return delineated).  If editing the smartsense.txt file, type the word followed by at least one space and enter the rating value between -10 and 10. Then press Enter so that each word and associated rating is on a separate line. The rating is used for internal calculations related to this feature. 10 is a highly positive word and -10 is extremely negative.  If editing the synlist.txt file, each group of synonyms is entered together on one line with each word separated by commas. For more information on editing this file, refer to Adding synonyms to be used when searching for answers.   Click Save.  When editing these files, the wltool utility must be run. If you edit these files using the File Manager, the wltool utility is run automatically when you save any of these three files.   If you have edited any of the exclude files and wish for these changes to affect all existing incidents and/or answers, you must rebuild the appropriate phrases table. Run the keyindexer utility to rebuild the phrases table. Refer to the section below.   Rebuilding the Phrases Table  If you have only added words to one of the exclude files, you do not need to rebuild your phrases table. However, if you add several words to Â a file, consider rebuilding the phrases table anyway so that the overall size of the table can be reduced. Reducing the size of the phrases table can improve the speed of searches performed on your site. If you have removed words from one or more of the exclude files, you must rebuild the phrases table. To do this, please submit an Ask Technical Support request to our Technical Support staff. In the assistance request, include the name of your site and which file you edited. The phrases table for answers Â is separate from the phrases table for your incidents. To rebuild the phrases tables for your answers or incidents, the keywordindexer utility Â must be run for your site in order for the words in the incidents and/or answers to be reindexed according to the new contents of the file. If you do not rebuild the index, changes to the text file (namely, the removal of words from the file) will apply ONLY to incidents and answers that are created or edited after the file was modified.  Note: When keywordindexer is run against your site, you may or may not take your site off-line. The process of reindexing your incidents and/or answers may take several hours depending on the number of incidents and answers in your knowledge base."

For those customers, Oracle will support eight (8) GA releases. With each subsequent release, the oldest GA release will be considered at its End of Life (Ã¢â‚¬Å“EOLÃ¢â‚¬Â). Â  However, it is advisable to stay as current as possible with regard to new releases, for the following reasons:  New features Â will be Â available to be adopted when the time is right for your business, without having any delay caused by Â upgrading as a Â pre-requisite. Some fixes in subsequent releases are for issues discovered by our customers in their real-world, production environments. Staying current not only allows you to address outstanding issues, but can also be considered preventative maintenance, as fixes may not seem to apply directly to your implementation, but could surface as an issue later.  For additional information, refer to the following Support Experience Blog: Maintaining a Healthy Site Series: Learning to Upgrade through Minecraft For additional information on the AUP, refer to Answer ID 6409: Auto Upgrade Program.

Comparing the weight, score, and computed score;Answer ID 1346;What is the difference between weight, score, and computed score?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Answers Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  In general, the weight field is calculated when a text search is performed to indicate how well the search text matches the contents of an answer or incident. The score and computed score indicate usage by end-users and may be affected by the placement of the answer in the overall list of answers. Brief descriptions for weight, score, and solved count are provided below. To better understand how these three fields work, consider adding them as output columns in an answer view or report so that you can see how searching affects the weight value but not the score or computed score.        Weight: The weight (also called matched weight) of an answer or incident is numerically calculated when a text search is performed -- either at the end-user pages or at the administration pages. When a search is performed, each keyword and phrase is compared to the contents of the incidents or answers.    The weight is calculated based on the frequency of keywords or phrases included. The location of the keyword or phrase is also taken into account; that is, words that match the Summary field have higher weights than those that appear only in the Answer or Thread fields. Larger weight values indicate strong matches to the search text.    Note: Weights do not take into account how frequently an answer is used or viewed. Â            Score: The score only affects answers within your site. Scores do not apply to incidents. The score indicates usage of the answer and how helpful that answer is to end-users. An answer that has a relatively large score indicates that several end-users have viewed that answer and that the answer was of favorable use to them. Â  This field is represented by 'answers.solved_count' in the database.    Viewing an answer affects the score. In addition, customer input when answering ""How well did this answer your question?"" also affects the score. In addition, when a support agent appends an answer to an incident response, the score is increased as well. Â            Computed Score: The computed score of an answer is frequently identical to its general score. However, if the display position of an answer is fixed as selected by the Display Position drop-down menu, that is, fixed at the top, middle, or bottom of your list of answers, the computed score is calculated using the score of the answers located at the top or bottom of the list. This field is represented by 'answers.solved' in the database    Answers that are fixed at the middle have computed scores that are half the largest score value. That is, if answer12 has the largest score value of 2400, if an answer is fixed at the middle, the fixed answer will have a computed score of 1200.    Similarly, if you create a new answer and set it to be Fixed at Top per the Display Position menu, when you publish the answer, its score will be zero, but the computed score will be larger than the highest score for all of your published answers. To see differences between the score and computed score, add both of these fields as an output column in a report or view.         Determining the Order of Search Results  For the Search Page view and all reports and views that allow text searching (for both answers and incidents), the first sort should be on the Weight field in descending order. That way, when a search is performed, answers and incidents are listed with the largest weight values at the top of the list. For the end-user Search Page view, the second sort generally should be on the Computed Score value, again in descending order. With this configuration, if no text search is performed, the answers are listed with the largest computed scores at the top of the list. That way, answers that you choose to fix at a location are listed properly and the remaining order is determined by customer usage. Note: For reports or views on the administrative pages that allow text searching, the second sort may be set as desired by the staff member, such as date created, last updated or reference number / Answer ID. That way, if a text search is not performed, the records are returned based on the value of the secondary sort field.  For additional information, refer to the 'Edit the Search Results Page' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Incidents are listed multiple times in a custom report based on thread entries;Answer ID 1348;We have created a custom report that uses the incident thread as part of the criteria. However, when we generate the report,Â why are theÂ incidents listed multiple times?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Incidents;"  When building custom reports based on the incident thread fields, there are actually several different types of threads, including the customer thread, the Â response thread, and the notes thread. When configuring a custom report, you may inadvertently set up the criteria or the output to report on multiple incident threads. If that is the case, your report may output a row anytime the specific word is in a thread, regardless of whether that is a customer thread, a response thread, or a note thread. Therefore, if you have an incident that contains ""error"" in two of these threads, you will see two output columns for that reference number. You may want to include the 'Incident Threads - Notes' in the output columns so that they can be differentiated, or you might want to limit the criteria to select from only one of the field types. The thread type can be found in the threads table (threads.entry_type). The Thread - Type is a numeric value and they are as follows:  1 -- Notes 2 -- Staff Account 3 -- Customer 4 -- Customer proxy 5 -- Â Chat 6 -- Rule Response 7 -- Rule Response Template 8 -- Voice Integration  By setting a criteria to be restricted to one of the incident thread types, only one type of thread entry will be evaluated when determining if the incident matches the criteria specified. Obviously, there are a number of ways to format this data depending on your dataset. Functionality like Rollups, Slicing, and Â Group filtering can also be beneficial if adding additional filters is not an option."

When searching, best matches do not appear at the top of the search results;Answer ID 1355;When I search for incidents and answers on our site, why don't the best matches appear at the top of the list of results?;['Answer ID 2492', 'Answer ID 2379'];  Phrase Searching, Customer Portal, Analytics Oracle B2C Service, All versions; If your search results do not appear to have the strongest matches listed at the top, this indicates that the search results are not being sorted by the proper field as set by the Â report or view Â for that page. In general, search results should first be ordered by the Weight value with a secondary sort defined on some other field. Â With answer searches, especially on the end-user Answers List page, Â the second sort is usually the Computed Score. This applies for searches on both the end-user pages and when creating reports and views for searching incidents and answers at the administration consoles. When a search is performed, weights are calculated for each answer or incident as an indicator of how well the incident or answer matches the text that is searched on. Therefore, when displaying search results, you must sort the results first by the weight in a descending order. If no text search is performed, then all weights are 0 and the items then are ordered by the second (and third) sorts as specified in the report or view. Note: Â  When searching for answers, the fix at top feature is not taken into account when the weights are calculated. Â  As a result, when a text search is performed, answers that have a display position of fix at top may not be at the top of the search results -- depending on what the weight is for that specific search term. Â  That is, if answer 5 is fixed at top, when you search for a word that is not in answer 5, that answer may not even be returned in the search results. If you want an answer to always be returned at the top of the list when any search is performed, consider setting up a topic word for that answer. For more information, refer to Answer ID 2492: Configuring Search Priority Words and Recommended Documents. For more information on the optimal sort order to allow for searching answers, refer to Answer ID 2379: Optimal sort order for published answers on the end-user page. Reports are used to display records of interest and the report defines the sort order of the records. When defining the sort columns, you can only Â use columns that are included as output columns of your report. The field can be configured to be a hidden column, but it must be included as an output column in the report. Therefore, if you wish to sort the records by a specific field and Â the field of interest is not showing when you try to define the sort fields, close the sort window and then drag and drop the field as an output column. Then, right click on the column and select Hide Column. Now, you can add that field as a sort field. To check the sort order Â of the report, use the steps below: From the navigation set, right click on the report name and select Edit Report Definition. Â  Or go to the Reports Explorer and navigate to the report and right click on the report and select Edit.  Â  From the Home tab, click the Sort button.  Â  Verify the first sort is Â by Weight and the remaining sorts are appropriate for your business needs.  Â  Click OK. Â  If you had to change the sort fields, save your report.

Using the Notify Subscribers menu with answer updates;Answer ID 1356;What is the Notify Subscribers menu used for when editing answers?;['Answer ID 2518', 'Answer ID 5168'];   All Releases / Answer Notifications;"  Â  The Notify Subscribers menu allows more control as to when an answer notification is emailed to the subscribers. Knowledge engineers can choose from the following options when saving an answer from the administration pages:  No Change Do Not Notify This Hour End of Today End of this Week End of this Month  Answer notifications are then batch processed so that at the time specified, each subscriber will receive only one email with all appropriate subscription links contained in the single email. For example if an end-user is subscribed to three answers that are updated and set to have the notification sent at End of Today, the end-user receives one email at the end of the day and that email has a three links -- one to each of the answers. The dbstatus utility is scheduled to run every 15 minutes Â to send update notifications. Therefore, the option to send notifications ""this hour"" indicates that the notification will be sent the next time the dbstatus utility runs. At most, it will be one hour from when the answer is saved that the notification will be sent. The Notify Subscribers menu is controlled by the answer workspace used by the staff member. Â  By default, the Notify Subscribers field is located on the Details tab in the answer workspace. To modify the default value of the Notify Subscribers menu, from the Common Â Configuration items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces/Workflows and open the answer workspace for editing. In the workspace, Â click the Notify Subscribers field Â located on the Details tab. Then on the Design tab on the ribbon set the Default Notification Action property to one of the following options:  No Change - do not notify Â - same action as the 'Do Not Notify' option, it is just another classification where you make minor changes such as spelling, grammar, etc. (default value) Do Not Notify - do not notify (default value) Â  Hourly - notify at end of hour Daily - notify at end of day Weekly - notify at end of week Monthly - notify at end of month Â   For more information on editing workspace properties, refer to Answer ID 2518: Setting Properties in Workspaces.

What are techmail considerations I need to know?;Answer ID 1361;What are techmail considerations I need to know?;['Answer ID 8745'];   Techmail Oracle B2C Service;  Considerations for techmail: Â (Note the below does not apply to the techmail on demand feature What is Techmail On Demand?)  Only one occurrence of techmail can be run for a given site. Â   Â  Upon connecting to a mailbox, a status count is taken of the number of messages at that instant and only those messages will be processed. Â If new messages arrive while techmail is running, those messages Â will be Â processed with the Â next techmail run.  Â  Once techmail has processed Â a new message, that message is then deleted from the mailbox. Â   Â  If a given run of techmail takes longer than the gap between runs, Â the gap between each run may increase to 2 (or more) times the scheduled gap between runs. Â   For example, if techmail is scheduled to run every fifteen minutes and the current techmail run is taking 20 minutes, the current run will finish, but the next run will not begin until the next scheduled run (in another 10 minutes). Â  As a result, techmail will have run only twice within 30 minutes instead of the expected 3 times. Â   Â  Techmail is not a real-time email delivery system. Â  Â  Â It is a scheduled batch delivery system and service level agreements (SLAs) should be based on incident creation and not on the sent time of an email. Â Performance should be based on when an incident is created, not when one thinks it should be created. Â  Â  Â   If real-time is needed, then Â submittal of incidents via the Ask a Question page on the end-user interface Â is the best way to go and is more secure.

Disabling a contact record;Answer ID 1367;How do I disable a contact record?;['Answer ID 8745'];   Contact records Oracle B2C Service, All supported versions; Note The default workspaces do NOT include the Disabled Flag fields. The Disabled Flag field needs to be added to the appropriate Â custom Â workspaces.    You can edit a contact record to disable that user from accessing your site.  From the Contact editor or the Contact tab when editing an incident, set the Disabled Flag field to Yes. Â  Â   When the record is disabled, the contact record is affected in the following ways:  If the site is password-protected the contact cannot log in using the User ID and Password specified in the contact record. Incidents remain associated to the contact record, but will not be accessible by the customer. Email messages sent from the contact's email address that are sent to a Service mailbox are discarded without creating an incident. Incident email responses will not be able to be sent to contacts who are disabled. Answer notifications are not sent to contacts who are disabled.  To enable the contact, simply change the Disabled flag back to 'no'.

Best practices for setting up an additional interface;Answer ID 1377;We want to add another interface to our site. What are some best practices for setting up our additional interface?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2001', 'Answer ID 2486', 'Answer ID 2001', 'Answer ID 531', 'Answer ID 1096', 'Answer ID 2205', 'Answer ID 1476'];   Setting up multi-interface site;"  Multiple interfaces allow you to provide a separate end-user site and differing information to a variety of audiences while maintaining one knowledge base and one database. Note: Additional interfaces are a chargable item. For more information on pricing and options, please contact your sales account manager. Use the best practices below in conjunction with Â your Â Oracle B2C Service Project Plan. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. For an overview of which Service features are shared across interfaces, refer to Answer ID 2001: Shared Service Feature for Multiple Interfaces.        Identify one Project Coordinator for the Overall Knowledge Base:  Identify a single person to be responsible for the entire Oracle B2C Service application. This project coordinator may then work with the application owners of the separate interfaces to ensure the overall integrity and usability of the knowledge base.           Obtain training:  Read Â the chapters and documentation above which describe multiple interfaces. This is crucial step to maintaining the integrity of the entire database. Make sure ALL of your staff that will be using an interface receives training in how to use the application. Â            Plan Appropriate End-User Display (Branding) for Each Interface:  The end-user pages of each interface must be configured appropriately for the Web site and for use by the target audience. This includes the interface URL, the look and feel or the site, and determining custom text to be used (i.e. custom message bases).             Plan for Multiple Language Interfaces:  When implementing an interface that will use a different language, it is critical to evaluate standards for how that language will be implemented across multiple language interfaces. Two or more countries may share a common language and may access your site; however those countries may use different codes, terminology, and standards for displaying information.   Â   For example, France, Belgium, Canada, and Switzerland all use French as a main language. When publishing information to the end-user pages, simply tagging an answer to a language may not have the correct information for that country. Proper pre-planning prevents poor performance on your site.    Additionally, language packs for an interface can only be applied at the time of interface creation.  Â Additional information on this can be found in Â Answer 2486: Changing the language of an interface.               Configuring an Interface Allows Access to Other Interfaces:  Staff members tasked with the configuration of an interface will see information associated with other interfaces when they access administration features. If you have multiple staff members configuring your site with full access, it is very important that they understand they will see information pertaining to other interfaces when they log in to the administration pages.    For example, a staff member who has access to the Staff Management, Customizable Menus, and Custom Fields tables has the ability to affect staff access and visibility to all interfaces, not just their own interface. This reinforces the importance of one Project Coordinator, who can ensure that staff members are aware of what is occurring with the entire knowledge base, not just their interface.    See Â Service features shared across multiple interfaces for more information.             Some Information Only Configured Through the Interface:  While most features Â can be configured regardless of which interface you are logged in to, some items are not shared across the administration pages of the different interfaces. In these cases, you must log in to the administration pages for the interface you wish to configure.           Some Information Shared Across All Interfaces:  When administering multiple interfaces, be aware that some information is shared across interfaces and cannot be restricted by using views or profiles. For example, when an incident is proposed to become an answer, there is no Interface field to use in the answer record, so answers cannot initially be sorted by interface. Â Instead consider using products, categories, or custom fields to manage proposed incidents. Similarly, contacts and organizations are not noted by interface.             Define Staff Needs for Access:  A major task when configuring multiple interfaces is planning and configuring staff access. Determine what information each staff member needs to access and then configure views, profiles, and staff groups accordingly. Start by determining which information is privileged per interface. Which information does each staff member need to access? Will staff be accessing information or assigning incidents across interfaces? Test the views and profiles for the appropriate staff as you perform the configuration.    See the following for more information:  Restricting staff members from full administrative access             Determine Content of each End-user Interface:  A major planning milestone that should be led by the Project Coordinator is to determine the visibility of answers in relation to products, categories, and answer access levels per interface. This activity also helps identify labeling challenges that may arise. Â     Answer 1096: Publishing different answers to different interfaces provides more information.           Define Answer Console Privileges and an Answer Publishing Process:  Determine who will be responsible for adding new content to the knowledge base. Also, define the process for how new answers will be reviewed and published. This includes defining proposal processes for staff answering incidents and publishing processes for new answers. If you have multiple interfaces in the same language, we recommend assigning one overall owner for the answers who understands which answers should be published to each interface and one owner for each interface.             Determine Business Rules Used for Each Interface:  Take the time to review your existing business rules to determine which rules are to be used with that interface. Determine if each business rule applies across all interfaces. If not, then use the IF condition in the rule to specify which interface the rule applies to.    Also consider the time zone and work hour settings for each interface and how these affect the escalation rules for your new interface. Interfaces using different languages may involve different time stamps. The configuration setting TZ_INTERFACE may need to be set for the relevant locale of the target audience using that interface.    See Â Best practices for setting up incident rules for more information.               Mailboxes per Language:  When allowing assistance requests to be submitted via email, create a mailbox for each language interface. For example, if a database has three interfaces, French, German, and English; create a separate mailbox for each interface. This ensures that the SmartAssistant Suggested Solutions, the receipt email message, and the response emails will be in the appropriate language. Separate mailboxes also ensure that emails are routed to the appropriate staff.   Answer 1476: Configuring mailboxes to support multiple language interfaces provides additional information."

Best practices for promoting the use of our site;Answer ID 1398;Now that our site is live to our customers, what are some best practices for promoting the use of our public answers on our site?;['Answer ID 633'];   Promoting your own site to your customers Oracle B2C Service (OSvC) site administration;"  Making your end-user pages most effective involves several areas of action:  Funnel Site Visitors to Use Self-Help Centralize Inbound Email Standardize the Design of Your Oracle B2C Service site Promote eService to Your Customers  Each of these areas include several best practices that are listed individually below.          Funnel Site Visitors to Use Self-Help   Phone Numbers Used Appropriately: If phone numbers must be displayed on your Web page, make sure to label them appropriately. Differentiate sales from marketing and partner phone numbers. Any support phone numbers should be contained within answers in your Oracle B2C Service site -- if displayed at all -- thereby funneling your end-users through your knowledge base to allow them to help themselves. If you must have a Contact Us page, any reference to your support area should be a link to your Oracle B2C Service support site rather than a phone number, again funneling the end-users to self-help.   One Click Access to Self-Help Support Site: When linking to your Oracle B2C Service application, create a single link from your main Web site home page to your site. This allows your customers easier access to Oracle B2C Service and trains them to go there for answers to their questions. Getting to your support site should be easy for your customers.   Turn off the Support Home Page (if not Used): If you are not using the announcements box on the Support Home page or have other customization, turn off your Support Home page so that site visitors go directly to your Answers page. This encourages your end-users to search for information prior to submitting assistance requests. If necessary, include custom links on the Support Home page so that the end-user has one place to go to link to everything they need.   Intuitive Entry Label for Support Site: Label the link to your Oracle B2C Service site appropriately for the end-users and to match with your company terminology. For example, ""Support"", ""Questions?"", ""Contact Us"". You could even use ""Ask ___"", where the blank is filled with your mascot or a branded icon that your end-users will identify.   Static FAQs Removed from the Web Site: Remove any static FAQs that were displayed elsewhere on your site. Static FAQs previously published to your site should be copied into your knowledge base as separate answers so that all self-help information is accessed through Oracle B2C Service. This makes it easier for your site visitors to find all information from one location.   All Info in the Support Site for One Stop Access: Make sure that all support information is contained in Answers within your Oracle B2C Service site. If you have links to manuals or other documentation make sure that these links are added to the Support Home Page as extension links or in the Announcements box if they are not links within answers. Other information that can be included as links on the Support Home page include purchasing links, dealer locator, order status, and current sales or marketing promotions.   Support Site Available from Every Web Page: Make sure that end-users can easily access your support site from all locations within your site.   Product Specific Links to Site Created (When Appropriate): If your Web site has distinct areas for specific items, for example each product has its own Web page, create predefined links to a list of answers with a prepopulated product and/or category. For more information on linking to answers in your site, refer to Answer ID 633: Linking to a public answer from outside of Oracle B2C Service.   Sequential Ordering Enabled: Sequential ordering allows you to require site visitors to view an answer or search for an answer before the Ask a Question tab is available. That is, end-users must use the Find Answers page before they can even submit an assistance request.                   Centralize Inbound Email   All Incoming Requests Routed into Support Site: Redirect all channels for support to your Oracle B2C Service application using mailboxes and/or the Ask a Question page. This includes emails, forms, and phone calls if appropriate.   Email Addresses Replaced with Link to Support Site or Routed into the Support Site: To encourage site visitors to use your Oracle B2C Service application, replace email addresses on your Web site with links to your Support Site so that assistance requests are submitted through the Ask a Question page. This allows requests to be managed in a similar manner through the Incident Console. These email addresses should route email into Oracle B2C Service through Email Gateway so that incoming email create incidents as well.   Ask a Question Page Enabled: Enable the Ask a Question page on your site to capture assistance requests. The Ask a Question page allows you to request (and require) additional information from the customer so that all relevant data is gathered initially, thereby saving your staff time in providing accurate information.                   Standardize the Design of your B2C Service Â Site   Message Bases Changed for Consistent Terminology: Customize the text on your Oracle B2C Service application to match the terminology used for the rest of your Web site.   Consistent Design Created on the Support Site (Seamless from Main Web Site): When customizing your eService Center application, match the look and feel of your eSC site to the colors and styles used for the rest of your Web site.   Appropriate Links Available from the Support Site to Access Other Areas of the Web Site: Ensure that the end-user can navigate back to your Web site from your Â site through your standard navigation.                   Promote Your Site to Your Customers   Fixed at Top Answer on How to Use the Support Site: Create an Answer using screen shots from your RightNow site that will train your end-users on the appropriate use of your self-help site. Include information on searching, submitting questions and expected response time.   On Hold Messages Changed to Direct Customers to the Self-Help Support Site: Update any on-hold messages, including staff voicemail messages, to tell customers to visit your new knowledge base for immediate assistance. Provide the URL to your B2C Service application in the message. For example, consider using a message similar to the following:   ""For assistance while you are waiting for a Â chat agent, XYZ company offers a 24 x 7 knowledgebase with over xxx number of answers that are easily searchable. You may also ask a question at any time at http://xyzcompany.custhelp.com.""   Marketing Collateral Updated to Promote Self-Help: Ensure that your marketing team has replaced email addresses and phone numbers on their collateral and are instead directing end-user customers to the self help resource for support. This includes newsletters, commercials, or direct mails.   Press Release Sent to the Existing Customer Base on the New Support Site: Notify your existing customers about your new site so that they can transition more easily to using your new published answers and support site."

Creating thumbnail graphics (screenshots) for answers;Answer ID 1399;How can I create thumbnail graphics similar to those used in the Oracle B2C Service knowledge base?;['Answer ID 633'];   Answers, Knowledge Base Oracle B2C Service;"  You can create thumbnail graphics to be used with your answers. For each graphic, we create two graphics: a small version of the graphic, which is used as the thumbnail and links to a larger version of the graphic. Then using standard HTML, you can use the graphics to construct a standard link using the &lt;a href&gt; and &lt;img&gt; tags. The smaller graphic is used with the &lt;img&gt; tag. You can add text to display along with the image tag (and smaller graphic). All of the content within the The &lt;a href&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; tags become part of the link. Images used in published answers should be stored on your own servers and referenced accordingly. General HTML Used: Â  &lt;a href=""http://URL_of_larger_graphic_here"" target=""new""&gt;&lt;img src=""http://URL_of_smaller_graphic_here""&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Text Under Graphic&lt;/a&gt; Using this format, the smaller graphic becomes a link which opens a new window with the larger graphic displayed. From there, you can then specify dimensions or additional attributes (such as an ""alt"" attribute) as you wish. When using the HTML editor, you can add a hyperlink (which creates the overall expression) Â and for the Text Â field of the hyperlink, enter the &lt;img src=""http://xyz""&gt; (which uses the image for the link.  For example: The code below is used to generate the thumbnail graphic at the bottom of this answer. &lt;a href=""https://cx.rightnow.com/euf/assets/cc_resources/screenshots/ 8x_basic_report.pps"" target=""new""&gt; &lt;img Â src=""https://cx.rightnow.com/euf/assets/cc_resources/screenshots/ 8x_basic_report_s.gif"" width=""145"" border=""0"" height=""100"" alt=""Click to Enlarge"" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click to Enlarge:&lt;br /&gt;Report Slideshow&lt;/a&gt; Actual thumbnail generated: Â   Click to Enlarge: Report Slideshow"

Effects of deleting staff accounts in Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 1415;What are the ramifications of disabling a staff account versus deleting a staff account?;['Answer ID 570', 'Answer ID 2474'];  Staff Accounts, All versions; When working with staff accounts, each record in the accounts table contains the staff member's name and a unique Â account ID Â number (acct_id). It is actually the acct_id number, not the account name, that is referenced elsewhere in incident thread and transaction records. Deleting individual staff accounts: When a staff account is deleted, the account table is updated and the acct_ID value is removed from the transactions table. This means that the incident thread and transaction records are no longer associated with that account ID and the transactions indicate the account name is Unspecified. Â  Incidents assigned to the deleted staff member remain assigned to the account group, but are no longer assigned to a specific individual. If you delete several staff members, it can be more difficult to determine which specific staff member provided support to the customer. Report schedules that are set to run from this account will also be removed. Please note, we do not have an automated restore process for deleted staff accounts, so you will need to engage the services of our Oracle Consulting team for assistance. Deleting a Â staff Â account group: You cannot delete a group if there is an account Â assigned to that group. You must first either delete the Â staff account(s) Â or move the Â accounts to another group. If you delete a group, any incidents assigned to that group are basically orphaned with regard to who the incident is assigned to. For each of these incidents, the Assigned field will display No Value or Undefined. If you decide to delete a group, before doing so, determine how many incidents are assigned to that group and evaluate whether those incidents should be reassigned elsewhere. Specifically, evaluate any incidents that have a status type that is Unresolved or Waiting. Similarly, all transactions associated with the group will display as Unspecified or Undefined after the group is deleted. Deleting a profile: Similarly, if you delete a profile, the profile ID is removed from the database. Â  Therefore, any reports based on profiles will no longer show data for that deleted profile. Â  Note: It is not possible to delete a profile that has accounts associated to it. Â  Staff accounts must be re-associated to alternate profiles prior to deletion. Alternatives to deleting records: Instead of deleting accounts or groups, consider reassigning the accounts to a special new group such as Former Staff. You could then disable their account. This allows you to retain these staff records in the database and Â the past transaction and thread records would still be attributed to the disabled staff account. For profiles, consider renaming them to 'Former Profile - Do Not Use'. You can edit the staff account and check the Account Locked checkbox to prevent the staff member from logging in or you can check the Permanently Disabled check box to permanently disable the account. Note: Any staff accounts marked as Disabled from Assignment, Disabled from Assignment/Report Filters, and Permanently Disabled, will not count towards your licensed users. You will be billed for the staff accounts that were enabled at the peak count of a service month. Also, any staff accounts that are locked by the administrator will not be counted. For more information on disabling staff accounts, refer to Answer ID 570: Disabling a Staff Account. For more information on how disabling staff accounts affects other records, refer to Answer ID 2474: Actions to take when disabling a staff account.

"Using SmartAssistant to suggest ""internal answers"" when answering incidents";Answer ID 1420;"Can we create a set of ""internal answers"" that our staff can use when responding to incidents, but that our customers cannot see from the end-user pages?";['Answer ID 570', 'Answer ID 2474'];"   Answers,Ã‚Â Analytics,Ã‚Â SmartAssistant  Issue   We want toÃ‚Â create a set of ""internal answers"" that our staff can use when responding to incidents, but that our customers cannot see from the end-user pages. When responding to incidents, we would like SmartAssistant to suggest answers for both published answers and ones created for internal purposes.";  You can create a set of answers that are assigned to a non-public access level or status and allow staff to search for those answers when editing an incident from the Search Knowledgebase button. Note: The report used when you click the SmartAssistant button is not configurable. You cannot include your internal answers to be considered when a staff member clicks the Smart Assistant button. By default, the search criteria when searching for answers from an open incident is set to search for answers set to a public status type. For this reason, it is easiest to set your internal answers to public status and Â an Internal access level (that is Â not enabled for end-user visibility). One Â approach for including a set of internal answers in your search results is described below:  First, create a custom answer access level to assign all the internal answers to, Â named Internal, for example. The visibility of the custom access level should be disabled for all interfaces, so that the answers are not displayed on the end-user pages.   Assign all of your internal answers to the Â Internal access level and a Public status. Â Even if these answers are assigned to the Public status, due to the configuration of the access level, the internal answers do not appear on the end-user pages.   Set the answers to products and categories that Â are visible to the end-user pages for the interface you are searching from. This ensures that the answers can be found through that interface.   Determine if you need to modify the search window used when the staff member clicks Search Knowledgebase. Â  If so, refer to the section below.   When editing an incident and Â using the Search Knowledgebase feature, Â select Internal for the access level and then perform Â the search.  Staff can append text from the internal answers to the incident response. Â  However, do not append a link to an internal answer. Due to the non-visible access level, a link to that answer gives a Permission Denied message to the user.  To customize the search criteria used to Â search for Â Internal answers, use the appropriate approach below: Â  By default, when a staff member clicks Search Knowledgebase, the Status Type and Access Level fields are included as run-time filters so that staff can change the values to search on. To customize the search criteria and the report used with the Search Knowledgebase feature, you can copy the Search Knowledgebase report and Â edit the copy. Then, in the workspace, Â click the incident thread relationship item and edit the Search Report ID property to select the report to use when the staff member presses that button.

Notifying staff when an answer is changed to Review status;Answer ID 1429;Does anyone receive an email notification about the change when an answer changes to Review status?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 2192'];   Answer Review Notification;"  Oracle RightNow Cloud Service includes the Answer Reviewed notification message. When this notification is enabled, a notification is sent to the staff member assigned to the answer. The notification appears in the Â Communication Center of the assigned staff member. Depending on the configuration of your site, an answer may be assigned to the Review status automatically by Oracle RightNow Cloud Service either due to a configured review date (enabled by the TC_AR_DATE_ENABLE Â configuration setting) or when the score for the answer decreases due to inactivity and reaches 0 (if the AR_AUTO_ENABLE Â setting is turned on). In either of these cases, when the answer status changes to Review, the Answer Reviewed notification is sent to the assigned staff member. To enable the Answer Reviewed notification, use the steps below: Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.

Scheduling a report to capture only last month's data;Answer ID 1433;How do I schedule a report to be sent on the first of each month, that includes data for the previous month?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics Oracle B2C Service;  When configuring your report, you can set a fixed filter for the date range so that Â the report Â is always Â rounded to the interval of interest. You can also set a run-time filter and then in the subscription, you can set the date range so that it is rounded to the appropriate interval. The filter should be set so that the value falls between:   Â -1 Month Rounded to 0 Months Rounded  Scheduled reports: When scheduling a report subscription, if the report has a run-time filter, you can set the interval for the report so that it is specific for your subscription. For example, if a report has a run-time filter that by default goes back one week, you can set the filter differently for the subscription. When setting up the subscription, click the Filters button to set the date range for the report subscription. Use the steps below to set a date range that will round to the appropriate interval:  Open the report for editing. Note: This can be done for Â any standard or custom report. Add or edit a filter for the date field of interest. Select Between as the operator. In the Add Filter pop-up window, enable the Relative checkboxes.

Including HTML in standard responses;Answer ID 1434;How are Standard Text values used in Incident responses?;['Answer ID 5380'];   HTML, Standard Text, Email  Issue   I would like to use HTML in my standard text responses, such as bolded text or a change in font color. I have enabled all email messages as HTML. I have created some standard text responses and populated the HTML Value field.  How can I have the HTML version of the response sent with the email?;  Use of HTML Field in Standard Text  When creating a standard text response, the contents in the HTML value are appended to the incident when a Business Rule uses the Append Response Template to Solution Field action. When the customer submits the Ask a Question request, the content of the HTML field is displayed in HTML on the end-user pages when the customer clicks Submit. The customer must then click Finish Submitting Question in order for the incident to be created. The HTML value is also used when the thread control on your workspace is set to Rich Text and the standard text is used as a response in a workflow rule or the agent adds it to the response thread. Note: Â  The text value is used when the thread control on your workspace is set to Plain text and the agent adds a standard text response or a workflow rule adds a response. Â  To include HTML formatting in standard text that is sent as a response to an incident, you must include the HTML code in the HTML Value field when you create the standard text response. When the response is sent, the HTML code is rendered in the sent email message. Note: As of the November 2012 release, you can use custom message templates, per interface, to customize your administration notifications, administrator emails, and contact emails. You can customize your message content, enable and disable notifications and emails, as well as define the message format as HTML or text.

Tips and Best Practices for maintaining answers;Answer ID 1447;What are some tips for helping us maintain the content of our answers?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, Maintaining your knowledge base Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  Maintaining current content in your knowledge base can be challenging, depending on the size of your published knowledge base, the release cycle of your products, and resources allocated for maintaining your answers. When using published answers in Oracle B2C Service, it is important to develop a review process so that you can proactively determine which answers need updating and modifying the content in a timely manner. With regard to actually performing the review and editing your answers, that comes down to allocating proper resources - both staff and time - to perform the task. Due to the visibility of the answers to your customers, maintaining your answer content should be given adequate priority in the overall strategy of providing good quality customer service. With regard to a general review process for answer content, please review the options listed below:  Determine Product or Sub-product of the Month  You might want to determine a ""product or sub-product of the month"". This means that all answers assigned to that product or sub-product will be reviewed within that calendar month. For example, product 1 might have 52 answers assigned to it, and you or your staff will review all of those answers during the month of July. Product 2 might have 34 answers and product 3 might have 27 answers. You could plan to review those answers during the month of August, and so on. This approach allows each part of your knowledge base to be reviewed in a certain time frame (say over six months or so). In addition, you know when each answer is either scheduled for review or was last reviewed. As a part of the review process, consider using the TC_AR_DATE_ENABLE Â feature that allows you to set a review date, at which time the answer will automatically change to the Review status. If you do not want the answer to change automatically to Review, consider adding a custom answer Â field for the month and year when the answer is to be reviewed next. Then, when the answer is reviewed, the staff member would open the answer and update the next review date. Note: You may or may not want to enable the date fields through the TC_AR_DATE_ENABLE Â configuration setting. When a date is set in this field, the status of the answer changes to Review on the date indicated. If you do not have the resources to review it then, you may not want the actual status of the answer to change. A custom field could capture the intended date of review, but would not actually change the status.  Review Prior to New Release of Product  Another review option is that if a new release of the product is scheduled, you can plan to review the answers for that product to coincide with the release date of the new version. If the content of the answer will change with the new release, you can prepare the new solution for the question in advance and store that information in the Notes field or other custom field that is set up as a Text Area type. Then, when the product is released, you can simply copy the contents of the Notes field into the Answer field to update the content in a more timely manner. You might want to create a custom field so that you can easily indicate which answers have solutions copied so that you can find them most easily when the product is released.  Â   Determine Editing Status  In order to flag answers quickly with regard to the editing work that needs to be done, consider adding custom statuses or a custom field that allows you to specify the action(s) that still need to be performed. For example, you could add custom statuses such as: Major Edits, Minor Edits, Verify on Release, Research New Content, Solution Copied, and Complete as a way of defining work that needs to be performed on each answer. That way, if you determine an issue with an answer, you can set the status to be ""major edit"" or ""minor edit"", which flags it immediately. This allows you to quickly find answers at a later time that need review or updating. You can create a custom report to count how many answers are assigned to each status. Â You can also create a custom report Â to allow you to search for answers based on their review status. You can configure your custom statuses to be a public status type so that those answers are still published to your site, even though the content may need to be updated. The custom statuses or custom field Â allow you to classify your answers ""behind the scenes"". Note: If you are already using custom statuses for some other reason, use a custom answer field, i.e. Review Status or Content Status, that includes menu items to capture the same information.  Â   Use Last Updated Field  Another field that can be helpful in reviewing content of answers is the Last Date Updated field. You might want to create a custom view that sorts the answers by the Last Date Updated field (in ascending order). This shows which of the answers have been published the longest and have not had edits made to them, which would make them viable for review. When the answer is reviewed, then, you could open and save the answer to reset the Updated field to the current date.  For additional information, refer to the 'Answer Management' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Effect of changing the name or deleting a product or category item;Answer ID 1449;What happens if I change the name of a product or category?;['Answer ID 1894'];  Products, Categories Issue  We are looking to change the name of a product or sub-product in the products menu (or similarly a category or sub-category in the Categories menu).Ã‚Â Ã‚Â We have answers assigned to the product/category.; Re-naming a product or category is a straight forward function and will not affect answer/incident associations. However, if you choose to delete (and re-add) a product or category, this will affect all associations.The same can be said for Dispositions as well. Renaming a value:If you simply rename a product or category, by editing it and changing its Name value, your modifications will be updated throughout the incidents and answers in your site. When a value has been renamed, incidents and answers will retain their association to the value and will merely reflect the updated name. Deleting a value and re-adding it:If you delete a product or category, all answer and incident associations are broken and the incidents and answers will be assigned to the unassigned, unspecified value. You cannot delete a product if there are any answers still associated with that product. Â  Adding the product or category back into the table with the same name does not re-associate the incidents and answers to that value. The associations between the incidents and answers and the product or category would need to be re-established. You can mass edit incidents to reassociate them to a product or category value. Â You can also mass edit answers to edit the product and category values. For more information regarding editing multiple records, refer to Answer ID 1894: Editing multiple records at the same time.

Allowing other contacts to update incidents;Answer ID 1457;How can I allow other contacts to update incidents submitted by coworkers?;['Answer ID 1960'];   Incoming E-mail, Configuration Settings;"  Beginning in 17D: The EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED configuration setting has been renamed to EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_MODE. Â  This setting determines the level of security applied when updating an incident by email.  Supported values are: 2 - Updating an incident by email is allowed only when the Reply-to or From address of the email message is listed in the contact record associated with the incident (that is, the primary or alternate email addresses). 1 - Updating an incident by email is allowed from any email address, but only if the new message includes a tracking string indicating a match to the site and incident in question. (Note that if  Â no tracking information is found but a ref_no is found in the subject, then an incident will be created if EGW_UPDATE_BY_CREATE is set to 1). 0 - Updating an incident by email is allowed from any email address based on reference number match only. IMPORTANT! SETTING THIS VALUE TO 0 MAY IMPACT SECURITY OR PRIVACY CONCERNS FOR YOUR SITE. The Default is 2.   *Note a setting of 0 allows an incident to be updated by as little as a reference number match in the subject. Because of this, a contact other than the original incident's contact can update the incident   Flowchart Â  This whole process may be better followed via this flowchart of the techmail/EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_MODE process:   The EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE configuration setting determines whether or not a contact record can be created by email. Â  Â   EXAMPLES An incoming email message will update an incident under the following conditions: Example 1: EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE is enabled and EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_MODE Â is disabled:  Matches an existing contact record based on the sending email address Â of the email message compared to the email addresses of a contact record Â ELSE creates a new contact record. Matches an existing reference number as identified in the subject ELSE creates a new incident for the sending contact. Example 2: EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE is disabled and EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_MODE Â is disabled:  Matches an existing contact record based on the Â sending email address Â of the email message compared to the email addresses of a contact record ELSE discards message. Matches an existing reference number as identified in the subject ELSE creates a new incident for the sending contact.   EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED In August 2017 and earlier: If the EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED configuration setting is enabled, updating an incident by email is only allowed when the sending email address of the email message (*see definition of sending mail address precedence Â below) is listed in the primary contact record associated with the incident (i.e. the primary or alternate email addresses configured for the contact). If disabled, an incident can be updated by email from any email address or a new contact record can be created (see EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE). The default is enabled (yes). Â  *Sending Email Address Precedence: Â  An incoming email message is considered to be from the address identified in the 'Reply-To' of the message. Â  Â If there is no 'Reply-To', then the email is considered to be from the address in the 'From' of the message. Â  Â If there is no 'Reply-To' or 'From', the email is considered to be from the Sender. Â  Â The email address precedence is 'Reply-To', 'From', 'Sender' in determining the sending email address.

Restricting staff members to only the proposed answers;Answer ID 1464;With answer records,Ã‚Â how do IÃ‚Â limit accessÃ‚Â for certain administrators by the answer status?;['Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 2439'];  Answers; In order to restrict access so that staff can only access proposed answers, the staff profile used by those staff members must be configured to restrict specific functionality. This is accomplished by defining a restrictive answer report to use and defining a restrictive navigation set. Then, you can configure the staff profile to restrict access to other answer reports. Therefore, to restrict staff access to only proposed answers, use the steps below: Step 1: Define Restricted Answer Report Â  Configure an answer report that includes a fixed filter for the answer status so that only proposed answers can be returned in the search results. You can include other fixed filters or run-time filters as you wish. For more information on creating custom reports, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a Basic Custom Report. Step 2: Configure the Navigation Set Â  You must create a navigation set to be used by the staff members. The navigation set defines which reports the staff member can access when they are logged in to the application. For the Answer navigation button, include the restricted answer report from step 1 above. Â  Do not include other answer reports that Â allow access to Â answers with a status other than Proposed. This is part of what restricts access to only view proposed answers. For more information on navigation sets, refer to Answer ID 2439: Creating and Customizing Navigation Sets. Step 3: Configure the Staff Profile Â  When you configure the staff profile, you must restrict the staff member's ability to create or edit new reports and restrict access to open other answer reports. Configure the profile with the following restrictions: On the ribbon click the Analytics button, the profile cannot allow staff to Â create or edit reports. Make sure the Create/Edit Reports and Create/Edit Public Reports boxes are clear. Â  Â Only specific reports in the Reports area should be enabled with Open permissions. This restricts which reports a staff member can run.  Â  On the ribbon click the Interfaces button, select the navigation set you created in step 2 above. Consider disabling the ability for staff to customize their navigation set. Â If the Customize Navigation Set box is disabled (clear), staff cannot add reports to their navigation lists. Â Though staff can only access the reports that Â have the Open permissions enabled for their profile, you may want to remove the ability to customize the report lists as well. Â  With the reports, navigation set, and profile configured to restrict access, log in as the staff member to verify which answers that staff member can access.

Question Submittal: This section provides statistics that are relevant to the customer visits that included an Ask a Question submittal. This section displays the number of questions submitted and the number of questions with a confirmed submittal, and tracks how many of those performed each one of these four actions. When an end-user clicks the Submit Question button on the Ask a Question page, the number in the Submitted column of the report increases by one. Then, when the end-user clicks the Finish Submitting Question button, the number in the Confirmed column increases by 1. The statistics in each of these columns reports on user activity prior to submitting those incidents. By looking at the difference between the Submitted and the Confirmed numbers, you can see how many users did not continue to submit their incident for any reason. Reasons may include that they found their answer in a Smart Assistant Suggested solution or that they closed their browser without finishing their request. The Resolved column shows how many end-users were deterred from asking a question. This number is calculated by subtracting the number of confirmed questions in each visit type from the number of submittals in each visit type. This number is then divided by the number of submittals in each visit type. For example, if 10 of the visits that viewed an answer also clicked the Submit Question button, but only 8 of the visits actually submitted an incident, the percent deterred would be 20 percent (10 - 8 = 2, 2/10 = 0.2). Separate statistics are listed for the type of actions performed in the visit as listed below:   Question Only: The end-user visited the Ask a Question page without searching or viewing an answer.  Â   Answer Only: The end-user submitted a question after viewing at least one answer, but did not perform a search.  Â   Search Only: The end-user submitted a question after performing at least one search, but did not view an answer.  Â   Search and Answer: The end-user submitted a question after performing at least one search and viewing at least one answer.  Â    Visit Comparison: This section compares the action of end-users who did not submit an incident (the Self Service column) and those end-users who did submit an incident (Non-Self Service column). For each type of visit (self-service and non self-service), the report lists the percentage of each type of visit that included a visit to each page. For example, if 10 visits that did not submit an incident occurred during the specified time period, and 5 of those visits visited the Support Home page, the percentage of self-service visits that visited the Support Home page would be 50 percent. Note: Single-page visits that only visit the Support Home page are not included in the statistics reported in the Self Service column of this report. This report also calculates the percent difference between each of the percentages. The percentage is calculated by subtracting the non self-service number from the self-service number and dividing by the non-self service percentage. For example, if 70 percent of self-service visits visited the answers list and 50 percent of non self-service visits also visited the answers list, the difference would be 40 percent (70-50/40). What the percentage difference means: If the number is a big positive number (e.g. something close to 100%), the trend is that people visiting that page tend to not ask questions (self-service). Â  Â This is expected this for Â the Answer Detail page, assuming the people asking questions do not Â look at answers. If the number is a small negative number (e.g. something close to -100%), the trend is that people visiting this page tend to ask questions (non-self service). Â  Â This would be expected for the Ask a Question page. If the number is right around 0, either positive or negative, there is not much difference between the two visit types (those that do vs. do not ask questions visit the page about the same rate). This data can help you quickly determine which pages are viewed more often by self-service customers than non self-service. For example, you can see how often non self-service end-users are viewing an answer in comparison to how many self-service users. An effective site would show that a high percentage of end-users are viewing an answer without submitting an incident.

Launching Chat from non-Oracle B2C Service Pages;Answer ID 1474;How do I launchÃ‚Â Chat from non-Oracle B2C Service pages?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Chat, Customer Portal Oracle B2C Service;" Many customers wish to create their own external chat launching page so that they may engage endusers browsing their own webpage. Â  Oracle B2C Service provides two different Syndicated widgets for use on non-Customer Portal pages. Â  The Syndicated Proactive Chat Widget allows for a pop-up invitation when certain conditions are met. Â  The Syndicated Conditional Chat Widget also allows for a static or dynamic link to chat. Â  Note: Â  If you use Engagement Engine, the inserted code will be different. 1. Begin with an HTML template file. Â  For example: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Your code will go within the body tags. This page will need to be placed on an external hosting site such as cloud9 or site44. 2. To get the code for your chat widget, go to the Customer Portal Administration Â page. Â  i.e. https://&lt;YOUR SITE&gt;.custhelp.com/ci/admin 3. Select ""Widgets"", then ""Syndicated Widgets"" from the drop down at the top menu. a.

Configuring mailboxes to support multiple language interfaces;Answer ID 1476;Is it possible to configure the same mailbox in different interfaces to support the different languages used for our site?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 331'];"  Mailboxes, Incoming Email Issue  We would likeÃ‚Â the same mailbox to be configuredÃ‚Â in different interfaces to support the different languages used for our site?Ã‚Â For example, can I use one mailbox, ""Support"", in the French, English, and Spanish interfaces to retrieve email submittals?"; With multiple interfaces, each interface should have its own unique mailbox. If the same mailbox were configured for different interfaces, there would be no means to distinguish which interface the email was submitted from. In this situation, when techmail runs for the first interface, techmail would download all of the mails from the mailbox. This would actually empty that mailbox. Then when techmail ran for the next interface, there would be no email to process since the box would be empty. Then, in the case of multiple languages, an incident could be created in an interface that utilizes a different language than the email that was submitted. This would affect your ability to use standard responses and spell check functionality. For additional information on mailbox configuration, refer to Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service.

Customizing the look and logo of a survey;Answer ID 1479;How do I customize the look of ourÃ‚Â surveys? We would like to include our own logo in the survey pages.;['Answer ID 5168'];   Surveys Oracle B2C Service;"  To customize the look of your survey, you can create a template in the Content Library and then apply that template to your survey. To create a template:  From the Oracle B2C Service Console, select New &gt; Content Library &gt; Template. You can then select Begin with Blank Content, Copy Existing Template or Upload HTML Content.  You can also click the Content Library navigation button and open the Templates explorer and either add a new template or copy an existing template.   Add custom elements to your template including header and footer content. You can add links and images using the Toolbox features, including unsubscribe links Â or insert snippets and symbols from the Tasks bar.   When finished, click Save and name your new template.  With a template created, you can apply the template to your Â survey:  Open your existing survey or create a new survey by selecting New &gt; Survey.   From the Questionnaire tab, click Â Apply Template.   In the pop-up window, select the appropriate template and click OK. Â The template name displays at the bottom of the Questionnaire page.   Add questions to your survey as you wish Â and save.  Note: The ""Apply Template"" functionality on the Questionnaire tab is available Â for both Â Basic and Advanced Â mode Â surveys. From Advanced mode, select the Survey Page element &gt; Designer Home tab, then Apply Template from the Survey Tasks section of the ribbon. Â  Only one template can be applied per survey.   To customize the default survey pages (such as Thank You, Forward to Friend, and Unsubscribe), create your header and footer via the File Manager &gt; switch to Outreach and Feedback (not backup or default!), then customize the survey as needed. Note: These files are interface-specific, so you might want to update them in multiple interfaces, according to your business needs. The messages held within those default pages are message base strings that can be modified Â via the Â Message Base editor. This is also discused in the answer provided above. Â  Images or any text can be easily added using the ADD HTML CONTENT task item Â to any survey page, while not applying it to every page in the survey. This is also the best way to place an image at the top of your Mobile-optimized surveys, as the Template will not apply when a touch-screen device is used and Apply Mobile Optimization is enabled in Survey Options. For additional information on Survey Task options, refer to the 'Creating questionnaires in basic mode' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently on.

Tips for searching on the Oracle B2C Service Support Site;Answer ID 1497;What are someÃ‚Â tips for searching in the Oracle B2C Service knowledge base?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle B2C Service Support site and Knowledgebase;"  Below are several tips and tricks to find what you're looking for within the Oracle B2C Service knowledge base. Searching for and viewing Â answers: Answers matching the search conditions display the summary, along with the first few lines of the content.  Â View an answer by clicking the Summary link. You can use either the basic or advanced search options.  Basic Search: The knowledge base defaults to a basic search by keyword. This allows you to search for answers based on words, phrases, or an answer ID Â that are Â entered in the search box.  Â  Advanced Search: Â  Click the Advanced Search link to include Â Product and Category filtering options for a more refined search. This also provides sorting options.  To view an answer in a different language: When viewing an answer, from the right side navigation area, you will find links for ""Available Languages for this Answer"". Â  Â Currently available options are: Â  Â English (US), Japanese, Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil). Â  Â  Where a translation is available, the link for that language will be live. Â  Â If a language listed is not available, but you would like it to be, Â you can submit a request for translation using the Answer Feedback option (i.e. select Yes Â to ""Was this answer helpful?"").  General Tips  The Oracle B2C Service knowledge base makes hundreds of useful answers to common (and sometimes not-so-common) questions available to our customers. Some answers provide steps and information for configuring and using features of our products. Other answers contain specific information for troubleshooting or customizing features of interest. Before submitting a service request to Technical Support, searching the knowledge base first can save time.  Â When you do a search, you get results from the knowledge base, documentation and the community. With so much information available, it is useful to know the different methods you can use to search for answers to your questions. There are also specific keyword search terms that will return a family of answers you may benefit from.  Â Please review the items below to gain more familiarity with utilizing our published knowledge base.  Include Rare Words: When using the Search Text field, if possible, include rare or unique words that would be included in the answer content. This allows your search results to be more specific. Â    For example, if you received an error within your application, using unique words from that error text can help narrow results.   Â  Â  Â    Use terminology consistent with our product: Our published answers use standard terminology that is consistent with our products and documentation.   For example, in our application the terms ""incidents"" and ""answers"" are used. Another organization may use ""tickets"" and ""articles"". Searching for terms that are not application-specific can return less than favorable results. Â    Â     Searching Â Phrases  You can search for answers based on specific words or phrases entered into the Search Text field. When multiple words or phrases are entered in the field, the words are searched using the OR functionality. Results are weighted. Meaning, answers that contain all or most of the words listed will generally appear at the top of your search results. Answers that contain only one of the multiple words listed will also appear in the search results, usually lower in the result set. If you want to search using the AND functionality, be sure to include a plus sign (+) before each word. For example, ""+custom +reports"". Â  You can also just type AND between the words you are searching for. Â  You can also use the minus sign (-) or NOT. Â  If NOT is in all caps, a search for ""rhythm NOT blues"" will return answers that contain ""rhythm"" but will exclude any answers that contain ""blues"".  Â Note:  Â It is necessary to use Â a space as a separator between words. Â  Note:  Â Combining the product and category filters along with using plus signs can greatly focus your results and reduce the number of answers returned.  Â   Â Useful Phrases for searching the B2C Service Knowledge Base  Specific to our site, there are a few useful keyword phrases that will return answers we hope you find helpful. Â   ""Popular"" This returns a family of answers useful if you want to learn about a feature or functionality.  Â These group related answers for a specific feature, providing you with a starting point.  Â  ""Best Practices"" This is another family of answers providing recommendations from Product Managers and Subject Matter Experts for a variety of features and functionality.  Â If you are looking to implement a new feature, this would be a great place to start.  Â  ""Troubleshooting"" Primarily written by our Technical Support staff, our troubleshooting type answers provide you with steps and information to resolve many common issues.  Â Should you need further assistance after stepping through one of these answers, you can submit a service request.  Â Provide the steps you did or things you checked with your results.  Â This can save time in the overall investigation and resolution."

Determining related answers for an existing answer;Answer ID 1499;How doesÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service build the related answers for an existing answer?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Answers, Relationships, All versions;" The Related Answers feature uses Â session Â data and contextual relationships to suggest solutions related to the answer being viewed. Â  Related answers are listed at the bottom of the Answer Display page. Â In Customer Portal (CP) end-user pages, the related answers display under the heading Answers others found helpful. Â  Â   Â  Knowledge engineers can also manually relate answers to other answers from the Relationships tab when editing the answer. In the Customer Portal, manually-related answers display in the same section as the system-defined related answers. Manually-related answers are listed first followed by the system-defined related answers.  Â   To illustrate how related answers are determined, one metaphor is referred to as the ""ant world view"". When an ant travels from one location to another, it leaves a very faint chemical trail to serve as a future reference to the path it took. If the ant finds food, other ants may follow this chemical trail, and, as they do so, they will lay down chemicals of their own and strengthen the trail signal. The more ants that follow the trail, the stronger the trail becomes over time. Similarly, if the trail is not followed by other ants, the chemical trail becomes weaker over time. The Related Answers feature works in a very similar manner. When an end-user visits the Find Answers area, their path through the site is tracked by the clickstreams table. Presumably, if a customer visits the site and does not find their answer on the first try, they make additional attempts to find the information they need by viewing other answers. The clickstreams data documents the implicit relationship between the answers they have viewed. As more and more users travel between answers which contain related content, these strengthening relationships are reflected in the clickstream data. Once enough data is accumulated to indicate a very strong relationship between two answers, each answer appears the list of Related Answers when viewing the other answer. Clickstreams table records all end-user activity for the Customer Portal page set. As with the ""ant world"" example, if a link between answers is not reinforced, its link strength gets weaker over time and the relationship between the answers is weakened as well -- that is, the link strength decays over time. This is referred to also as ""data aging""."

Create groupings of custom fields when viewing records;Answer ID 1500;How can I create groupings of displayed custom fields so that I can find related information more easily?;['Answer ID 715'];  Custom Fields, Folders; You can create folders for use with your custom fields. Then, you can drag and drop your custom fields to be in a specific folder. This allows you to group fields based on similar content. When viewing the custom fields in a record, the folder name becomes a shaded heading for that group of custom fields. That way, when viewing the record, you can easily see your groups of custom fields based on the folders they are in. When organizing your custom fields, if you have some fields that are not in a folder, those custom fields will display above or below the folder as listed in the custom fields table. To add folders for your custom fields, use the steps below: From the Custom Fields tree, in the left panel, right click on the custom field type and select Â New Folder.  Â  In the pop-up box, enter the common name, language name, and description for the folder. Note: The Â ID for the folder displays when you hover over the folder name. Â   Â  Drag and drop the custom fields to the folder. Note: When working with folders, you can also drag and drop the folder itself to a different location in the list. When dragging a folder, when you first click on the folder name, the contents in the folder may expand or collapse. Continue pressing the left-mouse button and drag the folder to its new location. Note: You can also configure custom fields to display horizontally across a page. For more information on configuring multiple columns, refer to Answer ID 715: Display Order and Number of Columns for Custom Fields.

Order of the IF and THEN statements in rules;Answer ID 1516;Does the order of the criteria as listed in the rule matter?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Business Rules Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  The order of the IF criteria does not matter when configuring a individual rule. Since the criteria have to match based on the logical expression used, the order of the criteria as listed in the rule is not important. However, the logical expression is important in defining the overall relationship of the IF criteria.  The order of the actions in the THEN part of the rule is important. Actions are performed in the order they are listed in the rule. In addition, when certain actions are added to the THEN section, you cannot add other actions beneath it. For example, if you include any of the following actions in the THEN part of the rule, you cannot add other actions to that rule:  Stop Processing Rules Transition State and Stop Transition State and Continue  All of these actions must be the last action in a rule because either the process stops entirely or the action is transitioned to a different state. If you have a rule with one of these actions listed and you want to add another action to the rule, you must edit the rule and delete the action listed above. Then, you can add another action or actions and then add the transition action or the stop processing action. Then, be sure to compile and activate the rulebase. Note: Â  Â Keep in mind that the order of the rules in the overall list of workflow and escalation rules is important in determining which rule will take effect. Â   For more information on Business Rules, refer to the 'Overview of Business Rules' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

This makes it easy to create links to images within several answers. You can add a variable (named dir, for example), similar to the following: &lt;img src=""http://domain.com/directory/sub-directory/sub-sub-directory Do not include a slash at the end of the variable. The slash is what will indicate to Oracle B2C Service where the variable ends and your text begins. Then in your answer, you can enter $dir/image_name.gif""&gt; to include your image. Be sure to include the closing HTML wicket (&gt;) so that the HTML is properly coded. Preview your answer prior to publishing to confirm the image displays Â correctly.";;

Excluding searches by staff members from report counts;Answer ID 1522;Is itÃ‚Â possible to exclude searching an end-user page activity performed by internal staff members?;['Answer ID 2694', 'Answer ID 2169', 'Answer ID 10427'];   Analytics, Configuration SettingsÃ‚Â  Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  You can avoid reporting on end-user page activity performed by Â internal staff members by having your Â staff members use the Search Knowledgebase functionality from within the Â Oracle B2C Service console. To search for an answer from within the console:  1. Open an Incident 2. Click the Search Knowledgebase button on the Messages tab to open the Search Knowledgebase window   To filter answers by product, click the Product Hierarchy drop-down menu and select the products you want the returned answers to be associated with. To filter answers by category, click the Category Hierarchy drop-down menu and select the products you want the returned answers to be associated with. To filter answers by the date they were updated, you can select either a date range or a time period. To limit the number of answers returned from the search, select the Limit check box and type the number of rows in the field.  3. Click the Search button to display related answers  For more information on editing the Search Knowledgebase report, refer to the following: Customizing the displayed search criteria in the incident editor's 'search knowledgebase' feature Customizing search results and reports in a workspace If you have questions around what generates a session and how you can prevent inaccurate session billing on your site please review Demystifying Session Usage (PDF).

FCRR statistic in the Agent Effectiveness report;Answer ID 1530;What is the statistic FCRR reported in the Agent Effectiveness report?;['Answer ID 2694', 'Answer ID 2169', 'Answer ID 10427'];  Analytics, Incidents;" The First Contact Resolution Rate (FCRR) is a statistic included in the Agent Effectiveness report to indicate how effectively incidents are being answered. The FCRR provides the percentage of incidents that were solved with only one agent response. The Â FCRR is calculated by: (the number of incidents solved by the queue/agent/group with only one response) / (the number of incidents solved with at least 1 response) In addition, the following apply to how incidents are counted: If an incident is solved without any responses sent, the incident is not included in the calculation at all. Â  Note: Â If a response email is not sent to the customer, the incident will not be counted. Auto-responses appended with rules are not counted. The Incident and SLA reports count the total number of responses sent for the solved incident in their FCRR calculations. If an incident is re-assigned to a different agent, group or queue and responses were sent by different assignees, only the responses sent by the final assigned agent/queue (the one credited with the solve) are counted.  The scenarios below provided basic examples for how the FCRR is calculated. Scenario A: Incident 1: Incident assigned to Agent Ann Incident 1: Ann responds and sets to Waiting Incident 1: Incident solved by agedatabase utility Incident 2: Incident assigned to Agent Ann Incident 2: Ann responds and sets to Waiting Incident 2: Incident updated by customer (set to Updated) Incident 2: Ann responds and sets to Waiting Incident 2: Incident solved by agedatabase utility In this case, Ann's FCRR would be 50%. She worked (meaning responded to), two different incidents, one of which was solved with only one response. Scenario B: Incident 1: Incident assigned to Agent Ann Incident 1: Ann responds and sets to Waiting Incident 1: Incident solved by agedatabase Incident 2: Incident assigned to Agent Bob Incident 2: Bob responds and sets to Waiting Incident 2: Incident solved by agedatabase Incident 3: Incident assigned to Agent Ann Incident 3: Ann responds and sets to Waiting Incident 3: Incident updated by customer (set to Updated) Incident 3: Ann re-assigns the incident to Agent Bob Incident 3: Bob responds and sets to Waiting Incident 3: Incident solved by agedatabase In this case, Ann's FCRR would be 100%. She sent only 1 response to the 1 incident she solved. Bob's FCRR would be 100%. He sent 1 response and solved his first incident. He only sent one response to the second incident before it was solved, and though Ann had sent a response too, the incident will be counted as ""solved with only 1 response"" by Bob. Scenario C: Incident 1: Incident assigned to Agent Ann Incident 1: Ann responds and sets to Waiting Incident 1: Incident solved by agedatabase Incident 2: Incident assigned to Agent Ann Incident 2: Ann responds and sets to Waiting Incident 2: Incident updated by customer (set to Updated) Incident 2: Ann responds and sets to Waiting Incident 2: Incident solved by agedatabase Incident 3: Incident assigned to Agent Ann Incident 3: Ann sets to Solved (no response sent) In this case, Ann's FCRR would be 50%. The last incident does not affect her FCRR since no response was ever sent."

Mailbox, Interface, and Source fields when editing incidents;Answer ID 1538;What are the Mailbox, Interface, and Source menu fields used for when editing an incident?;['Answer ID 2694', 'Answer ID 2169', 'Answer ID 10427'];  Incident Attributes; The Source field  Â indicates how the incident was created, such as from the Ask a Question page or from an email submittal. The Â Source field is located on the Details tab by default and Â cannot be set manually. Â The Source field Â is set based on how the incident is created. For example, incidents created from the Oracle B2C Service Console initially display No Value in the Source field. Â  When the incident is saved and re-opened, the Source displays as CX Console - Incident Editor. Note: Â  When adding a customer entry to the incident thread, staff can indicate the source of that specific thread by setting the value in the header to be By Phone, By Fax, By Post, By Web Form, or By Email. The Mailbox field allows you to associate each incident to a specific mailbox. The Mailbox field is located on Â the Details tab.  Â By selecting a different mailbox when you edit an incident, you can override the default mailbox or the mailbox the incident was originally associated with. This means that future responses will be sent from the mailbox you select. Since different mailboxes can have different display names and different reply-to addresses, you can ensure that the incident is associated with the proper mailbox for the content of the incident. Similarly, the Interface field allows you to specify the interface association of the incident. This allows agents to be logged into one interface but assign the incident to a different interface as necessary based on the source of the incident, i.e. a phone call or fax. In most cases, these fields are used when creating a new incident from the administration consoles. When creating a new incident, the staff member can specify which source, mailbox and/or interface the incident is to be associated with. This allows a staff member to create an incident while logged in to one interface, and yet associate the incident to a mailbox used with a different interface or to a different interface entirely. This allows staff to be able to create incidents from incoming phone calls and remain logged in to a single interface while creating incidents across all interfaces as necessary. You can modify the incident workspace to remove these fields.

Adding a signature to the response sent from Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 1557;How do I add a staff signature to the response I send for an incident?;['Answer ID 4466', 'Answer ID 5168'];Staff Account Signatures when responding to incidents;" There are two options to choose from when using signatures when responding to incidents - including the signature in the staff account or creating a standard response that can be included in the response that is sent.  Signatures in Staff Accounts  When configuring a staff account, you can enter a block of text in the Email Signature field. When sending a response, staff members can specify whether to include the signature with the incident response that is sent. The staff member can click the Options button on the Message toolbar of the incident thread to Â display the incident response options. If the Staff Account has content in the Email Signature field, the 'Include Signature' option will display within the Options. Â Note For each staff account the Â 'Include Signature' Â option is selected by default. In order to Â disable the 'Include Signature' being selected by default, simply uncheck the 'Include Signature' box. If the Email Signature field is null, the 'Include Signature' option does not display within the Â Options. For more information on enabling visual email, refer to Answer ID 4466: Visual Email Editor. Note: If you are on version November 2011 and newer but do not have visual email enabled, then refer to the section below.  Signatures in Standard Text Â Responses  You can create a standard text response for each staff member to use as their personal staff signature. Then, the staff member can use the hotkey shortcut to append their standard response to the incident thread. If you wish to create signatures for multiple staff members, you can keep these responses in their own folder for clarity.  Add a Standard Text Response for Each Appropriate Staff Member   From the Â Configuration items, Â select Service &gt; Standard Text. Â  To add a new standard text, click the New button on the ribbon. Enter a response name in the Name field, i.e. Bill signature. Enter a shortcut in the Hotkey, the initials of the staff member, for example. For the Type, select Incident Text. In the Value field, with the Text radio button selected, enter the signature text. Select the appropriate interface Â visibility Â  Click Add.  From the Edit Incident page, the staff member can append their personal response at the end of each response that is sent. Note: Â You can add a shortcut ID in the hotkey Â field. Then, from the Edit Incident page, press Â F8 and enter the shortcut ID in the pop-up window. The response is appended automatically.

Through these privileges, the organization can control who may access and submit service requests to the Oracle B2C Service Technical Support site Â and manage other contacts. There is no restriction on the number of contacts for your organization. This allows you to add contacts you deem appropriate for your organization. Please keep in mind that training is absolutely necessary for the success of a Designated Support Contact. Oracle B2C Service will actively monitor service requests from newly appointed Designated Support Contacts to ensure that proper training has been conducted. Once your new contact has been added, they will receive an email welcoming them to the Oracle B2C Service. Within the email, they will be given their User ID as well as instructions on how to reset their password. NOTE: For the security of your organization, we cannot provide Technical Support to anyone who is Â not a Designated Contact nor can we add contacts without a request via a service request. Therefore, it is in your best interest to keep this information current at all times, as it is used for providing Technical Support. For security reasons, it is strictly forbidden for Oracle employees to act Â as Â contacts on a customer or partner instance of the B2C Service CRM solution. Additionally, an Oracle employee should never request a customer or partner for their log in credentials. Qualified Oracle employees have alternative means to access required information. Â  Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  Â Important Considerations for Identifying Contacts within your Organization Â   One of the biggest keys to success in working with our Technical Support team is setting up the right people to engage with us. There are two different fundamentally important contacts a customer needs to identify within their organization and set-up in Oracle B2C Service to work regularly with our team: the IT Contact and the Site Administrator. Depending on the size of your organization, it can be possible to fill these roles with a single individual. In large organizations, these roles and responsibilities will be divided among several people. As an example, Oracle B2C Service Technical Support team makes use of 8 different Site Administrators to perform various tasks. Should, for any reason, your organization not have an individual specifically trained and designated as your site administrator, you can fill this gap by engaging with Oracle Consulting Services. Required Contacts For Your Organization The IT Contact within your organization is responsible for maintaining your workstations and network infrastructure to the specification required to make our solution run efficiently. Â  We require these IT contacts so that they can work directly with our environment specialists to resolve workstation or performance issues. If your organization has multiple locations or shifts, an IT Contact and Administrator for each location and shift should be chosen and entered as Designated Contacts. The Primary Support Contact/Site Administrator performs administrative tasks such as setting up users, issuing permissions, keeping contact records current, choosing configuration settings and customizing the site. Â  Our most successful customer Administrators are trained by Oracle. If for any reason the Administrator for your Oracle B2C Service site should change, the new administrators should be trained. You can find information about our Training offerings here: Oracle B2C Service or you may contact your Sales Account Executive for assistance. It is highly recommended that Site Administrators be set as Contact Type: Primary Support Contact with Service Privileges: Manage Contacts. At least one of your Contact types must have Manage Contact Privileges.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - Â  Â However, you should set up at least one back up in the event of an emergency.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - Â  Â Oracle recommends three contacts with Contact Management Privileges.

Â Contact Create Notifications             Checkbox to receive an email notification when new support contacts or contact managers are created.                The table also has filtering options for:  Disabled - Show only enabled or disabled contacts. Select 'Any' to show all contacts. Type - Filter by contacts with manage contact rights, support contacts or those that are knowledge base only. Access - Filter for Primary, Technical or KB Only contacts.     Â Create/Edit Â Contacts and Manage Â Contact Types and Permissions Â   The actions and features listed below are available to you if your customer record allows you to manage contacts for your company: Clicking the Add A New Contact button allows you to create a new customer record in the Oracle B2C Service support database. Â  To Edit an existing contact record simply click on the contact record from the table. Â     When filling out the form, specific formats are required for some fields as noted below:           Field Name  Description       Email Address  This field is copied as the contact's User ID and is case sensitive. Please use all lowercase letters when entering the email address.             Note: If a contact with the same email address already exists you will receive the message ""This contact already exists but is not on your organization"".             If the contact email you entered has the same domain as your own, you will be given the option to send an invitation to that contact. They will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation. Once accepted, they will be associated with your organization and appear in your contact list.     First and Last Names  Note that each contact should be verifiable by a first and last name. If we cannot identify an individual as the contact we can not work with them to resolve issues on your site.     Phone  When entering telephone numbers, use a period (.) to separate groups of numbers. Dashes are not allowed in this field.     Contact Permissions  Select the appropriate menu item for your new contact. Â  Manage Contacts, Designated Support Contact or Knowledge Base Access.

Â  Â              A disabled contact can no longer log in to the cx.rightnow.com support site and will no longer receive answer notifications. In addition, a service request is created and associated with your record to indicate that the account was disabled. Note: The disabled contact remains listed on the page.               Note: While you can disable contacts, it is not possible to delete/hide former contacts from displaying in the list. As a policy, Oracle B2C Service does not delete contact records since they reflect the overall history of your organization account and those disabled contacts frequently have historical service requests associated with their records.         Â Contact Permissions (Access) Â   The Contact Management pages list three Â different permission levels Â a contact can be associated to. The Â permission level Â associated Â to a Â contact is set when the contact is added for your organization. These Â permission levels Â are:  Manage Contacts: A contact with this designation has the abilities to add/disable contacts and are provided with Knowledge Base Access as well as the abilities given to Designated Support Contacts. In addition, Â they are authorized to access your data, are also responsible for reviewing your Designated Contact list periodically to ensure contact information is correct. For additional information, read the Support Experience Blog post, Maintaining a Healthy Site Series: Technical Contacts.   Designated Support Contact: A contact with this designation has all the benefits of knowledge base access as well as the ability to login to this support site and access the full knowledge base. Support Contacts can also submit Â service requests to the Oracle Â Service Â Cloud organization. Note: Â Contacts with this designation must be trained in the use of the relevant portion of the Â Oracle B2C Service Solution for their position. If it becomes apparent that a contact with this designation does not have sufficient training we will work with the Contact Manager to assist in obtaining the proper training or to re-designate the contact in question. Â    Knowledge Base Access: Â A contact with this designation can search our collection of knowledge base articles for troubleshooting and how-to type questions, in addition to Product Documentation and Tutorials. Â      Â Partners Â     If you are a Contact Manager for your own organization, you can add and edit permissions for partners who work with you. Giving your partners permissions allows them to view, update, or create service requests on your behalf.  Â This is accessed from the Site Tools page by Â selecting the My Partners link.   Â  Â   Â  Â Details for this option are provided here:  Â Granting Partners Permission to Manage Service Requests     If you are a partner, you can request permissions from your client/customers for yourself and others in your organization. Partners permissions allow you to view, update, create service requests or manage contacts on your client/customer's behalf.   Â  Â   Â  Â Details for this option are provided here:  Â Partner Permissions     It is also possible to create a new Designated Support Contact when updating an existing service request submitted to Oracle B2C Service Technical Support.

Creating incidents efficiently from incoming calls;Answer ID 1571;How can I efficiently create incidents from incoming phone calls?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Creating incidents from customer phone calls Oracle B2C Service;"  Oracle B2C Service can be used to capture questions and issues that are submitted and handled through a telephone call. This allows your staff to capture the nature of the issue and specify what information was provided to the customer. Time can be billed to these incidents to allow for reporting and future reference. When a call is received, the agent is responsible for creating the incident from the administration console. A simple process for creating a customer record and incident from a telephone call is provided below. Specific steps used depend on which version of Â the application is used.  You can either create a new incident and then search to see if an existing contact record exists and associate the contact record or you can search for the contact record first and then create a new incident for that contact record. If the caller does not have a contact record in the application, the staff member creates the new incident and new contact record at the same time. Option 1: Searching for the contact record first Â   The agent should be logged in to the console and have a report configured to allow them to search for contact records by email address or name. Â   Note that it is the email address that makes a contact record unique in the application so the agent needs to be able to easily distinguish records by the email address listed.   The agent receives the call and asks for the name or email address of the contact. The agent performs the search for the record.  If Â a contact record Â exists: the agent can right click on the record in the report grid and select New &gt; Incident (for selected contact). When the incident opens, the contact information is populated from the contact record. The agent can proceed with recording the incident information.  If the contact record does not exist: the agent can click New &gt; Â Incident from the upper left corner of the console. From the Contacts tab, the agent Â can add a new contact to be associated with the incident. Or the agent can right click in the Contact ID field and select Add New to create a contact record for the caller.    Within the application, a staff member can open a contact record, click the Incidents tab and click New to fill out the new incident. Â  When using this approach, the staff member can click OK to close the incident record. Â  However, at this point, the incident has not yet been created since it is a child record to the contact record. The staff member must save the contact record as well in order to actually create the incident -- even if the contact record itself was not edited. Â  Option 2: Opening a new incident and associating the contact record  The agent is logged in to the console and receives a call.   The agent clicks New &gt; Incident from the upper left corner of the console. Â  A blank incident opens in the console.   The agent can search for the contact record by clicking the magnifying glass to the right of the Contact ID field. If the record exists, the agent can associate the new incident to the record. Otherwise, the agent can right click in the field and select Add New to create a contact record for the caller.   Configuration Considerations  Â  Typically, assistance requests that are phoned in are often handled during the call and do not require a response to be sent to the customer. As a result, the customer's email address is not necessarily required. Review the incident and contact workspaces to determine and verify which fields should be required when agents use those workspaces. Open the workspace for editing and click on the field. In the Properties box, review the RequiredOption property to determine under which conditions the field is required.  For additional information, refer to the 'Add a Contact' and 'Add an Incident' sections in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Answer Viewed and Service Summary reports list different numbers for answer hits;Answer ID 1577;Why don't the Answer Viewed and Answers Viewed by Product or Category reports generate the same numbers (Hits) in the Answer Summary section?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Answers Viewed Reports Issue  The Answer Viewed and Answers Viewed by Product or Category reports are not generating the same numbers (Hits) in the Answer Summary section. The Answers Viewed report seems to be the more accurate of the two because the numbers more closely match the numbers of the Service Summary report. Sometimes, though, the Answers Viewed and Service Summary report have different results as well.; The Answers Viewed report counts the total number of answers viewed in the time frame specified. Answers Viewed by Product or Category: If you have answers with multiple products and or categories specified, the number of hits in the Answers Viewed by Product and Answers Viewed by Category reports will be significantly higher than the Answers Viewed report. With the Answers Viewed by Product or Category reports, since there is no means of knowing which of the various products and categories to associate the hits with, these reports increment once for each product/category selected. In other words, if you have an answer that has 3 product values selected, viewing this Answer will increment the Answers Viewed by Product value 3 times, once under each of the product options. The Answers Viewed and Service Summary reports increment only once. As a result, the Answers Viewed by Product or Category reports can be much higher than the other reports. Answers Viewed: The value in the Answers Viewed report usually matches the information in the Service Summary report. These values may differ, however, if you have deleted answers from your database. Since the Answers Viewed report statistic is recorded by Answer ID, if an answer is deleted, so are the associated statistics. The child records are removed to maintain data integrity. The total in the Service Summary report remains the same since it is stored in another location, but the Answers Viewed Report is now fewer since it no longer includes the statistics of the deleted answer(s).

Editing an active survey in Feedback;Answer ID 1578;How can I edit my active survey?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 9051'];   Outreach, Feedback, Surveys;"  We have a URL in our survey that has changed, and I need to update the URL that is part of the active survey. I would also like to add a question to the survey. Note: To maintain the integrity of a survey and its results, it is recommended that you not make any changes to it once the survey has been launched. Additionally, questions can be edited after they have been created, even if they have been used in a survey. However, if you edit a questionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s text or choices, those changes appear immediately in any survey it has been included in. For this reason, if you want to preserve the integrity of the data returned by the original question/survey, we recommend creating a new question rather than editing the existing question/survey. Note: In general, you do not want to delete the original survey; you merely want to cancel Â it. If you delete a survey, you will also delete all of the data and results from that survey. Therefore, it is best to not delete a survey, but rather set its status to Cancelled.  Steps to Â copy, edit, and Â launch the new survey:  To copy Â the survey: From the Surveys navigation button, open the Surveys explorer. Â  Locate the survey. Â  Right click on the survey and select Copy. Â  Enter the name of the new survey and click OK. You can then open the copy for editing. To edit the question: Open the new survey for editing and click the Questionnaire tab. To remove a question, click Remove in the upper, right corner of the question. Then, click Add a Question. In the pop-up window, you can select an Â already existing question or click New Survey Question to create a new question. Â  Â Save the survey when you have reconfigured the survey. Â  To launch the new survey: For a web survey, click Survey URL from the toolbar and update the link to your survey. For a broadcast or transactional survey, Â click the Audience tab to confirm the audience configuration. Then, click the Proofing tab to proof the new survey. When you are finished, Â click Â the Delivery tab to launch the survey. To disable the old survey: For a web survey, make sure all links to that survey are removed and replaced. Â  For a broadcast or transactional survey, click the Delivery tab and click Cancel Invitation Â Message (or Cancel Mailing) Â and save the survey.  How to edit a survey that has been already sent:   There is a configuration setting that allows the ability to change a survey invitation once it has been sent.

Enabling and using the HTML (WYSIWYG) editor with answers;Answer ID 1581;How do I enable the HTML / WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor to use when creating or editing answers?;['Answer ID 9051'];   HTML Editor Oracle B2C Service, 17D and older versions;"  The HTML editor is always enabled when editing answers. From the Question or Answer field, you can add or edit content in Design or Source mode. By default, the Design and Source tabs display at the bottom of the Answer Text tab. If you use answer variables to include specific HTML code such as a font face or color, you must use an answer variable to close the HTML tag used in the variable. For example, if you use a variable to call out a specific font color and to bold the text, then create an answer variable to close the font tag and to close the bold (strong) tag.  Design mode: In Design mode, you have a toolbox that allows you to easily insert answer links, insert conditional sections, search the knowledge base or call SmartMerge. The toolbox also allow you to easily add hyperlinks, images, and tables. Note: When inserting a button from the toolbox, you must click to Source mode to add supporting code that executes for that button. When working in Design mode, the default font appears to be Times New Roman, 12 pt. However, this is merely the setting of the menus. When text is added using these default values, no font face or font size callouts are indicated with the text. That is, there is nothing in the underlying HTML code that sets the font face or size to be the value of the menus. As a result, the actual style used on the end-user pages is defined by the enduser.css style sheet, specifically the .text and .desc classes in the style sheet. It is not possible to specify a different default font used with the HTML editor. The font face and font size menus should only be used if you wish to set specific text to a certain font face or size. Â  (NOTE: The font in the Answer WYSIWYG Â can be Â determined by your browser's default font. It is set here: Control Panel &gt; Internet Options &gt; Appearance &gt; Fonts &gt; Webpage Font.) To view the underlying HTML code, click the Source tab. Source mode: If you prefer to use a text editor, click the Source tab and enter appropriate HTML code for your question and answer content. Note that only tags that appear within the &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; tags of a page are supported in the answer editor Source view. Â  If you have questions about your code, change to the Design view and back to the Source view before completing your edits. Extraneous HTML tags are removed when moving to the Design view. The Quick Preview tab allows you to preview the content of your Question and Answer fields -- even without saving the answer first. That way, if you are editing an existing, published answer, you can preview the modified content before you save it to your published answer."

Right side of answers and reports truncated when printing;Answer ID 1588;Is there some special formatting that should be in place to ensure that the entire answer or report prints without cutting off text on the right side of the page?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Printing, Analytics, Answers Oracle B2C Service;"  The following provides information on printing both reports and answers.  Printing Reports  You Â can make a report fit the width of the page so it will print properly. Â  When printing a report to fit the page, default page width settings are automatically used and page breaks set in the report are not applied to the printed report. To print a report to fit the page:  Open the report you want to print. Click the Home Tab, and click the Print Button. Select File then Page Setup (or Print Preview) to modify page options.  Whether you print a report from the administration pages or from a scheduled report that is sent in web format, you run into the same printing issues as with any web page. If the report is too wide for the printer, the right side of the page is truncated. Consider printing the report in landscape mode instead of portrait (generally found under Â Orientation options). If the report is wider than the landscape orientation, consider editing the width of the columns used in the report and specify narrower widths where possible. In addition, you can export the report in an Excel format and print the entire report using Excel. If the report is generated from a scheduled report, send the subscription using the Excel format and then print the report from there.  Printing Answers  When printing answers from the end-user pages, there are several factors that may affect how the answer prints. If the Â end-user prints an answer using the print feature in their browser, that is, File &gt; Print, the right-hand part of the answer may be cut off due to the page width. The preferred method for printing an answer is to click the Print Answer feature Â located in the left section of the page when viewing an answer. This feature is designed to print the answer in a ""printer-friendly"" version of the answer. When using the Print Answer feature, the text should wrap around so that the right-hand part of the answer is not cut off. Another issue that may affect the printout of an answer (even when the Print Answer feature is used) is including HTML tables within an answer. HTML tables can be configured to be a certain width, and if that width is wider than the allowed print space, the right-hand part of the answer could be cut off when printing the answer. The fix to this is to reformat the table and specify narrower column widths. Due to variations in printers, browsers, and operating systems used by your end-users, there is no ""fixed"" answer as to how wide an HTML table can be and still print correctly. Generally, the maximum width of the printed page is 600-640 pixels. Keep in mind, this includes the width of the Product and/or Category fields that are printed on the left-hand side of the page, if those fields are enabled. The actual page width used when printing answers varies depending on the lengths of the names of your products and categories which forms the width of the left-hand box when using the Print Answer button. If you find that table content gets truncated when the answer is printed, consider the following options:  Consider using percentage for width versus pixels. The table editor within the answer workspace defaults to pixels. This can be changed to a percentage by editing the Table Properties &gt; Width option. Modify the width and test until the desired result is achieved.   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â    Consider modifying the column widths within your table to be narrower. Keep track of the total width of the HTML table and decrease the table width first to be less than 500 pixels, and continue to modify the table as necessary to determine what the best width is.  Note: After modifying the overall table width, you may determine that the table itself needs reformatting due to the narrower columns.   Reformat the table by removing columns or including different types of lists to present the information. For example, in the original table, one column may contain the name of a feature and a second column may provide a description of that feature. Consider combining those columns into one column. You could use bold or colored text for the feature name and include the description in regular text all within one column."

Limiting the number of thread entries included in responses;Answer ID 1594;How can I limit the number of thread entries included in responses sent by our agents?;['Answer ID 5489', 'Answer ID 1960'];  November 2012Ã‚Â and older releases;" The MAIL_INC_THREAD_LEN configuration setting indicates the maximum number of discussion thread entries included in emails sent from Oracle B2C Service. This configuration setting is deprecated beginning with the February 2013 release. Note: This setting does not affect administration emails, which always include the entire thread. This setting does not work with message templates. For more information, refer to Answer ID 5489: Message Templates and MAIL_INC_THREAD_LEN. To include the entire discussion thread, enter 9999 for the value of this setting. A value of 0 excludes all thread entries from the email messages. By default, this is set to 10.

Including email headers for incidents created from email;Answer ID 1595;Can we view the email headers for incidents created from email submitted to a mailbox?;['Answer ID 5489', 'Answer ID 1960'];  Incoming E-mail;" When end-users submit a question via email, their email header information can be saved and displayed in the incident thread. If the EGW_SAVE_EMAIL_HEADERS configuration setting is enabled (default is disabled), the envelope icon appears in the incident thread entry header. When a staff member clicks the envelope, a pop-up window opens that displays the email header information for the email sent by the end-user. Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. Note: To copy header information from an incident, you can click on the envelope icon to view the header and then use CTRL+A or CTRL+C to copy the content. Then, paste the information into the notes field of the incident using CTRL+V. Save the incident and you can then forward the incident to another person and the internal notes are included in the forwarded incident."

Benefits of having two mailboxes instead of just one;Answer ID 1603;What are the benefits of having two mailboxes as opposed to just one?;['Answer ID 331'];   Site Configuration - Mailboxes;  You might consider having multiple mailboxes configured if your end-users send assistance requests to more than one email address and you want those requests to be routed and handled differently based on the address through which the email is submitted. With multiple mailboxes, all of the email sent to your mailboxes can be turned into incidents in your Oracle B2C Service application. However, since those incidents are generated from different mailboxes, you could also create workflow rules to route the incidents from each mailbox to different staff members or staff groups. If you were to forward all the messages from the various contact email addresses into one mailbox, you would lose the ability to route them to different groups based on their origin. If routing based on origin is not an issue (or any other action that a workflow rule can perform such as appending a standard response) then one email account in Oracle B2C Service could be used to turn all email messages into incidents. For incidents created through the Ask a Question page, you can route incidents based on the criteria of your choosing, i.e. based on a specific product, category, custom field value, or the interface name itself. Incidents created from email, however, do not utilize these fields when routing incidents. For email submittals, you may route incidents based on the mailbox through which the incident was submitted.  For additional information, refer to Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service.

Best practices for setting up the administration side of Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 1619;What are the best practices for setting up the administration side of Oracle B2C Service?;['Answer ID 2506'];   Oracle B2C Service;"  When implementing your Oracle B2C Service application, it is important to set up features on the administration side of your site to make your site usable and efficient for your staff members. These practices are listed below:  Current Software Version Business Rules Staff Efficiency Features Knowledge Base Management Customer Satisfaction  Each of these areas include best practices that are listed individually below.          Current Software Version   Application on Current Major Release: Keeping your RightNow application on the most recent major release (and preferably the most recent dot release) allows you and your staff to utilize the most current features and functionality available as well as issues that have been fixed from previous versions of software.                             Business Rules   SmartAssistant Workflow Rule Restricted by Product/Category: Create a workflow rule for requests submitted through the Ask a Question page that suggests published answers to your end-user before the incident is actually submitted. This allows your site visitors to become familiar with your knowledge base and the suggested solutions may provide the answer to the issue more quickly. Restrict the suggested solutions by the same product and/or category if those fields are displayed.   Incoming Requests Assigned to Specific Staff Members or Groups: Create workflow rules to automatically assign incoming assistance requests to specific staff members or specific staff groups. The last workflow rule in the list of Ask a Question rules should be a ""catch-all"" rule that assigns all remaining incoming requests to a staff member or staff group, for example, IF source is Ask a Question, assign incident to Group A. In that way, all ask a question requests are routed to someone or some group for handling.   Auto Response Work Flow for Email to Promote Support via the Web: When Oracle B2C Service is initially released, some companies retain a support email address that was used prior to the implementation of Oracle B2C Service. Therefore, your end-users may not be aware of your published knowledge base. Create a workflow rule for email submittals that sends a standard response containing a link to the RightNow site. In this way you can educate your end-users to use your site as a resource and the preferred method for asking questions.   Free-Form Emails Routed via Workflow Rules: Create workflow rules to route incidents submitted to an email address through a mailbox. As with assistance requests submitted through your Web site, email requests should be routed using workflow rules to ensure that they are assigned to appropriate staff members or staff groups. The last workflow rule in the list of email workflow rules should be a ""catch-all"" rule that assigns all remaining email requests to a staff member or staff group, for example, IF source is Email, assign incident to Group B. In that way, all email requests are routed to someone or some group for handling.   Escalation Rules Created: If you have a standard Service Level Agreement (SLA), set up an escalation rule or rules to notify staff members when the time allotment is close or has been exceeded. For example, if your SLA is that your staff will respond within 8 hours of receipt of a question, set up an escalation rule to flag the incidents that have reached 4 (or 6) hours since the incident was created. This could be used in conjunction with a custom field for escalation so you could do multiple escalations on a single incident; assign to a manager at 6 hours, and send a standard response at 8 hours, communicating to the customer that your staff is continuing to work on their issue and they should receive a response soon.                             Staff Efficiency Features   Appropriate Reports / Views and Profiles Created: Based on your staff members and staff groups, define appropriate profiles to allow staff members to access components of the application they are responsible for. Similarly, define appropriate views for the Incident, Customer, and Answer Consoles and determine which staff members can manage their own views.   Standard Responses In Use: Create standard responses for response content that is frequently sent to your customers. This allows your staff to append pre-defined content when sending responses, which saves time and reduces typographical errors. Group similar standard responses in folders to allow staff members to locate the appropriate standard response quickly.   Knowledge Base Available to Agents: Make sure that your internal staff who answer incoming calls and emails have access to the information in the knowledge base to enhance productivity and to ensure accurate and standard responses.   Incident Custom Fields Created (Where Applicable): Custom fields allow you to capture additional, specific information when an end-user submits a request through the Ask a Question page. Determine what information you need from your customers when they submit a request so that you can capture all relevant information up front when the incident is initially submitted.   Time Billed in Use: The time billed feature allows your staff to record time spent on resolving customer issues. This allows you to determine how your staff's time is spent.                             Knowledge Base Management   Monitor Reports Regularly: It is critical to review the system reports within Oracle B2C Service on a regular basis to ensure that your knowledge base is up to date and working for you. Critical reports include the Service Summary, Keyword Searches, Answers Viewed, Site Effectiveness, and Session Tracking reports. Use Report Subscriptions to deliver reports to employees in your organization on a regular basis. This ensures that the knowledge base is being maintained and continues to work for your organization.   Answers Reviewed Regularly to Ensure Current Data: Define a review process to ensure the content of your knowledge base is reviewed and updated appropriately. Identify who is responsible for reviewing your knowledge base and with what frequency.   Intuitive Product/Category Classifications: Create Product and/or Category classifications that are intuitive and useful to your site visitors. Products and/or categories should be general enough to cover the entire range of content you are publishing to your site, yet should not be overly specific so as to have too many items listed in the Product and Category drop-down menus.   Minimum One Answer per Product/Category Combination: If both the Product and Category menus are used on your end-user pages, include at least one answer for each product/category combination so that your site visitors can view at least one answer when searching by these menus.   Intuitive Subject Lines Present on the Find Answers Page: The Subject line of the answer is the link that the site visitor selects to view the details of an answer. The Subject line must describe the issue addressed in the answer and compel the user to click on it. The entire Subject line should be visible to the end-user for ease of use.   Search Page View Simplified: Keep the Search/Find Answers page simple for your customers to use. Do not present extraneous information on the Search or Find Answers page that may confuse or appear too complicated for your site visitors. Frequently, the best view for the end-users is one column which displays the Subject line.   Answer Feedback Enabled: If Answer Feedback is enabled, you are able to receive suggestions from end-users regarding the content of specific answers for improvements and updates. However, you may not want customers to submit questions through this feedback feature. One way to address this issue is to create a standard response for all Answer Feedback incidents that informs end-users that their feedback has been received and that questions will not be responded to via this incident. This standard response is then delivered by a workflow rule.   Define Answer Publishing Process: Define a process within your organization for publishing new answers to your Find Answers page. This includes identifying the appropriate people write and/or edit the answer content, the use of custom answer statuses, answer custom fields and variables. For example, you may need a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to initially edit the proposed answers, then pass it on to Marketing, and then to Legal for final review and publishing.                             Customer Satisfaction   Closed Incident Surveys Used: Set up a Â transactional survey Â (closed-incident survey) Â to allow your end-users the opportunity to provide feedback on the knowledge and service provided. Evaluate survey results at a specified frequency so that you can monitor the satisfaction of your customerbase.   Scoring for Survey Escalation Used: Create scoring for multiple choice or ranking questions within your survey(s). Then create notification rules to send an email to specific email addresses if an end-user has selected a specific response. This allows you to automatically escalate a negative response to the appropriate person within the support department to address."

Oracle B2C Service mailboxes, POP3 mail accounts, and mail servers;Answer ID 1620;How do OracleÃ‚Â Service CloudÃ‚Â mailboxes relate to POP3 mail accounts and mail servers?;['Answer ID 8745', 'Answer ID 7537', 'Answer ID 6354', 'Answer ID 331'];   Mailboxes;"  In the Service application, mailboxes configured in the Mailboxes table allow email to be brought into your site and be converted into an incident to be handled by your support agents. These mailboxes must be configured correctly with regard to a specific interface in order to access the appropriate email and create incidents from those emails. Note: As of the August 2014 release, Oracle RightNow CX is referred to as Oracle B2C Service. In general, one mail server can hold any number of unique mailboxes. Each standard POP3 mail account has three basic characteristics that identify it as a unique mailbox:  the account name (or username) the password the name of the mail server itself  To retrieve mail messages from the mailbox, the mailbox owner must use a POP3 mail client, such as Outlook. For this to happen, the mail client must be preconfigured with the characteristics of the mail account; namely, the username, password, and the name of the mail server it is on. Knowing this information, the mail client can contact the specified mail server, give it the username and the password, and the mail server then allows the client to access messages waiting in that mailbox. Like a standard email client, Service has the ability to access a mailbox and retrieve incoming email messages. This is because Â Service has its own mail client applicationÃ¢â‚¬â€a special utility called Techmail that runs approximately every fifteen minutes (unless using Techmail On Demand), and accesses one or more mailboxes, retrieves new messages, and turns them into incidents on your site. These incidents are then viewed and handled from the administrative side of your Oracle B2C Service application. The Techmail utility is somewhat complex, but the method it uses to access a POP3 mail account is Â identical to Â the method used by other mail clients. Techmail must know the username, the password, and the mail server name for each mailbox it accesses. This is what you specify when you configure a general Service mailbox in Oracle Â Service Â Cloud. The username is specified in the POP Account field, the password in the Password field, and the mail server's name goes in the POP Server field. Â Keep in mind Â that the mailbox Name field has no functional value for accessing the mailbox. It is only used as a label, so you can easily identify each mailbox in the list. Note: If your mailbox is hosted with Oracle B2C Service, Â Oracle can provide you with the mailbox's Â POP account, POP server, and password. Submit an incident Â for this information. Â Mailboxes are a chargeable item. If you do not have any available mailboxes and would like to purchase additional mailboxes, please contact your Â account manager. Â If your mailbox is hosted on your own servers, contact your own organization's Â mail administrator for Â your mailbox information. Oracle-managed Service mailboxes can be created in the Oracle Cloud Portal - Configuration Assistant self-service tool. See the following for more information:   Â Answer ID 7537: Oracle B2C Service Configuration Assistant on Oracle Cloud Portal  Â Answer ID 6354: Adding, deleting or configuring Oracle-managed Service mailboxes  With Oracle-managed Service mailboxes, Oracle configures crucial incoming email settings for you and then you can edit the mailbox fields that are used to brand your mailbox. Â  Additional information regarding setting up mailboxes is available in Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service. When configuring multiple mailboxes, each mailbox configuration specified in the Mailboxes table must correspond to a unique mailbox. You should never have more than one mailbox in this list with the same POP Account and POP Server values. By applying the appropriate username and password combination to each mailbox configuration, Techmail can access each mailbox and create incidents from Â the various Â mailboxes."

Staff cannot view, edit or delete certain contact or organization records;Answer ID 1622;;['Answer ID 1998'];"   Staff Accounts, Profiles, Contact State Oracle B2C Service  Issue   My agent sees ""You do not have permission to view this record"" when trying to open some contact records, but can open others without issue.";"  In most cases, when a staff member can view or Â edit most contact or organization records but cannot view or edit Â other records, it is due to the State of the contact or organization and the staff member's profile configuration. Staff Â profiles can be configured to allow staff the ability to only view, edit, or delete Â contacts and organizations that have specific states. Â  This allows you to ""lock down"" certain types of records so that only certain staff can access them or modify them. For example, a profile may be configured to allow staff the ability to edit contacts that have a Opportunities, Outreach or Opportunities and Outreach state. If the staff member with that profile Â opens a contact that is also a Service state, they cannot edit the contact record. To determine why a contact or organization cannot be edited, you must first determine the state associated with the record(s) that cannot be edited. Then, compare that to the staff profile. Step 1: Determine record state. Â  For the record that cannot be edited, determine the state associated with the record. Â  That is, is it enabled for Opportunities, Outreach, and / or Service? To determine the state of the record:  View Â the State field on the top right of the contact or organization record.    Step 2: Evaluate staff member's profile. Â  Next, review the configuration permissions of the staff profile to ensure that staff can edit records with that state:  From the Â Configuration items, select Staff Management &gt; Â Profiles.   Open the profile associated to the staff account. On the ribbon, click the Permissions button.   From the Organizations or Contacts tab, determine which types of records (based on State) can be read, edited, or deleted.  Â  Â  Determine if the profile should be modified to allow edit privileges for more states.   For additional information, refer to Â State field with contact and organization records."

When an answer is saved, the answer's content is indexed in the knowledge base, and the answer is instantly available for searching. Single words and 2- and 3-word phrases may be indexed for an answer. Two factors determine whether a word or phrase is indexed:  Excluded wordlist file. If the word is listed in the exclude file, the word itself and phrases containing that word are not indexed for the answer, and answers containing that word or phrase are not returned in a search. Limitation on phrases indexed. There is a limit as to the number of unique words and phrases that are indexed for each answer. This represents the maximum number of words and phrases that can be added to the phrases table for each answer. Â   The limit is 750 unique words and phrases. Â  As a result of this limit, words and phrases that are located toward the end of a long answer may not be indexed for that answer and as a result may not be searchable.  Therefore, if an answer is not returned with a search and you know that the word or phrase exists in the answer, check to see if any of the words are excluded for searching. In addition, you may need to see where within the answer the word or phrase is located. If the word or phrase is towards the bottom of a long answer, the word or phrase may not be getting indexed due to the phrase limit.

Allowing bounced incident responses into Oracle B2C Service for review;Answer ID 1638;;['Answer ID 1914'];  Bounced incident response emails Oracle B2C Service (OSvC) Issue  We use closed-incident surveys with ourÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service (OSvC) site. Sometimes our customers indicate that we never responded to their question. When we look at the history of the incident, we see that we did answer their question and we sent a response. We would like to know if there is some kind of email delivery problem where we did send a response, but for some reason, it either was not delivered or was bounced. We would like to see how those bounces are processed and what bounced.;" By default, the mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service are configured to delete returned messages, such as mailer daemon errors. You can, however, configure your mailbox settings to allow returned messages in the mailbox, which would then Â update incidents in your Â Oracle B2C Service Â application. Allowing these returned messages into your system gives you the opportunity to review the message and attempt to find a root cause for the failure. You can have rejected messages sent to a different email address. That way, rejected mail can monitored and evaluated without having them create new incidents in your Oracle B2C Service Â  application. In order to allow returned messages to not be deleted by the system, use the steps below: From the Configuration items, select Â Site Configuration &gt; Â Mailboxes.  Â  Double-click Â the Service Â mailbox.  Â  Click the Incoming Email button on the ribbon.  Â  Uncheck the Delete Returned Messages box. By disabling this option, returned messages will not be deleted.  Â  In order to have returned messages sent to a different address, enter the address in the Send Rejected Messages To field. If you leave this field blank, the rejected messages will be sent to the mailbox address and will create a new incident at the application.  Â  Click Save.  Â  Edit other mailboxes, if necessary.  Â  Test for results.  In order to test your change, create a test incident and contact with a fake email address and send a response to it. This should cause a mailer daemon error to bounce back to your techmail box, where it will be brought into the system as a new incident."

Encouraging only feedback about answers on the Answer Feedback page;Answer ID 1646;;['Answer ID 383', 'Answer ID 483', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answer Feedback, Message Bases Oracle B2C Service  Issue   We recently turned on the feature that allows end-users to provide feedback on our published answers. We have already had a number of customers using the feedback feature to submit new incidents instead. We would like toÃ‚Â stop this from happening.;"  There is no way to ensure that new assistance requests are not submitted via the answer feedback option. Since the form allows free-form text, the end-user always has the opportunity to submit new questions within the form. However, there are a few of options you can consider in order to minimize how frequently this occurs.  Option 1: Modify Message Bases for the Feedback Page  By modifying the message bases that are used with the Answer Feedback page, you can discourage end-users from submitting new questions through this page. However, HTML is not allowed in most message bases, so minimal formatting is available. To find and modify these message bases, use the path: Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Message Bases &gt; Search by Key or Text As Â examples:  IS_THIS_ANSWER_HELPFUL_LBL The default text of, ""Is this answer helpful?"" could be changed to, ""Was this answer helpful? Â  Please provide feedback on the contents here."" RATING_SUBMITTED_PLS_TELL_ANS_MSG The default text of, ""Your rating has been submitted, please tell us how we can make this answer more useful."" could be changed to, ""Your rating has been submitted, please tell us how we can make this answer more useful. Â  Answer Feedback is routed to our Knowledge Base Team so published content can be reviewed. Â  If you would like to contact our Support Team please submit your issue from our Ask a Question page.""  This allows an administrator to modify the message base. Â They might want to include instructions to the user to go to the Ask a Question tab if they need a response to a question. For more information on editing message bases, refer to Answer ID 383: Determining Which Message Base to Edit.  Option 2: Use a Standard Text Response to Send to the End-user  Another option to encourage only feedback about the answer is that when the answer feedback is submitted, you can create a standard response and a workflow rule so that a response is sent to the end-user thanking them for their feedback and informing them that feedback will be evaluated with regard to the answer. You can include in the response that if they require an answer to their question, they must submit an incident through the Ask a Question page. Depending on your internal processes, you may soften the content of the standard response by state the 'preferred method' for receiving support is by submitting the question through the Ask a Question page instead of the feedback page. To do this, use the steps below:  First create a standard text response and enable the Rules Text check box. Â From the Â Configuration items, select Service &gt; Standard Text.  For more information on configuring standard text responses, refer to Answer ID 483: Creating standard responses for incidents and chat. Â    Configure an incident rule to append the response and send it to the customer. The rule would be set up similar to the following:  IF Incident Source is Answer Feedback  THEN Append Response Template to Response Field (highlight the appropriate standard response) AND Send E-mail Response to Sender and Set Status  With this rule in place, when the incident is created from the feedback feature, the customer receives a response with instructions for submitting an assistance request through the preferred Ask a Question feature.  Option 3: Disable the Answer Feedback Feature  If you find that most of the feedback you get is really a new incident and that you are not getting true feedback about the content of your answers, consider disabling the feedback page entirely. Â  Â Within Customer Portal, you must edit the detail.php page and remove reference to the AnswerFeedback widget. To do this, refer to the 'Remove Answer Feedback from the Answer Details Page' section in online documentation for the version your site is running.  Option 4: Prevent Feedback from Creating an Incident  You can allow customers to still submit Feedback on an Answer but not have the Feedback create an incident. The AnswerFeedback widget by default will pop up a form to allow the customer to enter in further details regarding their feedback, when a rating level is below a certain threshold value. To disable this, you will need to change the AnswerFeedback widget code in your Answer detail.php page to reflect a dialog_threshold attribute of 0: Â  Â  Example: &lt;rn:widget path=""feedback/AnswerFeedback"" dialog_threshold=0 /&gt; Â  Â  This will still allow customers to provide Answer feedback but will prevent an incident from being created. For more information, refer to the 'Change the Rating Threshold' in online documentation for the version your site is running.

Finding answers that are public, but are not on the end-user pages;Answer ID 1648;How do I determine public answersÃ‚Â that are not showing to the end-user pages?;['Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answers Oracle B2C Service  Issue   When I search on public answers in the administration pages, I have 5 more answers than what are indicated on the end-user pages. Why is this happening and how can I determine which five answers are not showing to the end-user pages?;  To publish an answer to your end-user pages, the following conditions must be met:  The answer status must be a public status type. Â  The answer access level must be visible for the interface or is used for privileged access. Â  The language must match the interface. The Answers view must allow the answers to be displayed based on the filters set in the view. Â  The Products and Categories must be assigned if products and categories are enabled on the end-user pages.   Therefore, if answers are set to the public status on the administration pages, but do not appear on the end-user pages, you must review the access level, product, category, and language for your answers. You can create a custom report that lists your answers along with the product, category, status, access level and language. You can then sort the results by the various fields to determine which answers either do not have a value set at all or are set to a value that prevents the answer from displaying on the end-user pages (such as a non-visible product or category). In addition, you may need to check the configuration of the end-user page report or view to make sure that certain answers are not being filtered out from the display.  Product and Category Considerations   When answers are proposed from incidents, by default, the proposed answer has the same product and category value as the original incident. If products and categories are not required on your Ask a Question page, the incident may not have a product or category specified. As a result, the proposed answer may not have a product or category either. You can have more than two levels of products and categories. In order for an answer to be published, the answer must be assigned to at least one value that is visible to the end-user pages. If the answer is assigned only to values that at the lowest level of the hierarchy are not visible to the end-user pages, the answer will not display. For example, if you have three levels of products and only the top two levels are enabled for end-user visibility, you will not be able to publish answers for that combination of products since the lowest level is not visible. To publish answers, you would need to create at least one value at the lowest level that is end-user visible and assign the answers to that.  Â   Creating a Custom Report   You can also create a custom report to list all public answers. Include the Status, Access Level, Language, Product, and Category in the report output so that you can scan the report to determine which public answers are not assigned to have a product, category or correct access level or language ID. Once the custom report is generated, you can export the report output in a .csv file so that you can analyze the results in Excel. For more information on creating custom reports, refer to the appropriate answer according to your version of software:  Answer ID 2509: Creating a Basic Custom Report    End-User Page Configuration   If the visibilities for the access level, product, category, and language are all enabled for end-user visibility and the status is a public status type, you will also need to review the configuration of the report for the end-user page. By default, the end-user pages include a fixed filter for the access level that is set to User Access. This User Access filter allows the end-user to view answers that are set to access levels that are enabled for end-user visibility or access levels used with privileged access (if the end-user is granted access to the privileged answers). If this filter has been modified, privileged access will not work correctly and even public answers may not display. Therefore, review the filters that are set for the Answers page view. For information on this, refer to the 'Change the Search Report' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Cannot save an incident in a waiting or solved status;Answer ID 1656;"I get aÃ‚Â message that states ""You have response text which has not been sent to the customer, this incident is currently in a non unresolved status. Please either send your response text or save it as a note.""";['Answer ID 2518'];" Ã‚Â  Incident Threads, Workspace Properties Oracle B2C Service, All versions Issue  I get aÃ‚Â message that states ""You have response text which has not been sent to the customer, this incident is currently in a non unresolved status. Please either send your response text or save it as a note.""";  Â  If an incident has an uncommitted thread in the response field, you cannot set the incident to the Waiting or Solved status. A thread is uncommitted if you can open the incident and the text in the Response field Â can be edited further. This indicates that the text has not been committed to the incident thread and has not been sent to the customer. Â  Once the Â incident response Â is sent, it becomes part of the committed thread and can no longer be edited. An uncommitted thread infers that there is still work in progress, and Oracle B2C Service does not allow incidents to be closed when there is an indication that the issue is not fully resolved. If you try to solve an incident with an uncommitted thread, a pop-up window displays Â with a warning message to either send your response text or save it as a note. Â At that point, the agent must send a response to the customer in order to commit the response to the thread or remove the thread from the Response field and save the incident. The agent could move Â the uncommitted content to be an internal Private Note and then save the incident. Uncommitted threads can only exist if Â the application allows responses to be saved in an incident without committing them to the thread. The 'Commit Response On Save' property can be configured in the incident workspace for the Incident Thread relationship item:  Â  Â  Â  1. Â  If this property is disabled (set to FALSE), staff can add responses to an incident and save the incident without sending a response. When the incident is re-opened, the staff member can still edit the response. At this point, the staff member cannot set the incident to a waiting or solved status since the incident contains an uncommitted thread. The staff member must either send the response or remove the content from the response field.  Â  Â   Â 2. Â  If the 'Commit Response On Save' property is enabled Â (set to True), when an incident is saved, any content in the Response field is committed to the thread regardless of whether a response was sent to the end-user or not. As a result, that content cannot be edited. In this case, an agent can set the incident to a waiting or solved status since the response was committed to the incident thread. In order to modify the 'Commit Response on Save' property, open the workspace for editing and click within the messages tab. Then select on the Design tab on the ribbon and click the Response Options button. Then, edit the property. For more information on editing workspace properties, refer to Answer ID 2518: Setting Properties in Workspaces.

Adding synonyms to be used when searching for answers;Answer ID 1660;How do I add synonyms to be used when searching for answers?;['Answer ID 1301', 'Answer ID 1995'];   Synonyms, Aliases Oracle B2C Service;"  Depending on which version of Oracle B2C Service you are using, there are several options for including synonyms and additional search terms when you search for answers.  Keywords and phrases can be added individually to specific answers. The aliases.txt file allows you to define specific sets of keywords to be used across all answers in your knowledgebase. The aliases.txt file is used with all types of searching (such as Phrases and Exact Phrases). The aliases.txt file is helpful for defining business-specific synonyms and acronyms used throughout your answer content and across the entire knowledge base.   The thesaurus.txt file is a comprehensive synonym list that is used when using the Similar Phrases option when searching. The thesaurus.txt file is not used with other search types such as Phrases or Exact Phrases.  Adding Keywords to an Individual Answer  When you edit and save an answer, you can include specific keywords directly to the answer in the Keywords field. This allows you to define specific synonyms for individual answers in your site. That is, if users search for a specific phrase or acronym, you might only want a couple of answers returned in the search. In that case, you could add the search word or phrase to the Keywords field and those answers will be returned (along with any answers that have that term in the actual Summary, Question, or Answer field). When adding multiple words or phrases, it is important to separate the words and phrases using a comma so that they are indexed correctly in the database. This allows you to more tightly control which keywords are used with specific answers. For more information on adding keywords to individual answer, refer to Answer ID 1301: Keywords field when editing answers.  Defining Aliases for All Answers and Search Types  The Â aliases.txt file allows you to define an overall group of synonyms that are be used for searching answers from either the end-user Answers page or the administrative pages. The aliases.txt file allows you to define a global or ""master"" list of keywords to be used when searching for answers. Typically, this file is used for business-specific terminology and acronyms that you define. Frequently, when people begin populating keywords for their answers, they determine that the same group of keywords should be added to several answers and used throughout the entire set of published answers. The aliases.txt file allows you to define sets of keywords and synonyms that are used across all answers with every answer search that is performed, regardless of whether the search type is Phrases, Similar Phrases, Exact Search or Complex Expression. For more information on using the aliases.txt file, refer to Answer ID 1995: Using a list of common aliases and keywords for all answers. To access the aliases.txt file, go to the File Manager. Then, set the Switch to menu to be ""wordlist files"".  Similar Phrases Synonyms  The default configuration of the end-user pages allows users to search using the Similar Phrases option from the Search By menu. This search option returns answers that include synonyms for the search phrase as defined by the synonym relationships listed in the thesaurus.txt file. The thesaurus.txt file defines the synonyms to be used and included when using the Similar Phrases search type. The contents of the thesaurus.txt file is quite exhaustive and includes synonyms for general words used in everyday language, not just synonyms for technical terms or business-specific terms and acronyms used in your industry. As a result, when users search using the Similar Phrases option, they will typically get a large number of answers back as their search results. Due to the large amount of synonyms defined and the large query results from the database, this type of searching may take longer to perform than other searching methods. For this reason, the synonym list is NOT used for standard phrase searching, exact phrase searching or with complex expressions. To access the thesaurus.txt file, go to the File Manager. Then, set the Switch to menu to be ""wordlist files"".  Editing the aliases.txt and thesaurus.txt Files  Defining synonym relationships in the aliases.txt and thesaurus.txt is similar. For both the aliases.txt and thesaurus.txt files, each line in the file is set up to mean: IF the first word in the line is used as the search word, THEN return answers containing that word or any of the other words on that line. That is, the first word on each line of the file is the search word and the additional words are the synonyms that exist in your answers that will be searched for. Therefore, when someone searches on the first word, answers that include the remaining words are returned in the search. When adding words to the list: Â  Multi-word phrases are supported within the aliases.txt file, but not within the thesaurus.txt file. Â  Â Note: if using multi-word phrases within the aliases.txt file and ANS_AND_SEARCH is enabled, phrases are expanded before aliases are processed. Â  Example: Assume the aliases.txt file contains (note the space within RIGHT NOW): Â  Â RIGHT NOW,RNT Assume an answer contains ""RNT"". Search for ""RIGHT NOW"" If ANS_AND_SEARCH is enabled, a search for ""RIGHT NOW"" will not return the RNT answer since a Boolean AND search tries to match all single word phrases. Â  Â In this case, it would try to match both ""RIGHT"" and ""NOW"". Â  Â Since ""RIGHT"" and ""NOW"" do not have aliases, the search will not match the RNT answer even though the ""RIGHT NOW"" phrases will expand to include ""RNT"". Hyphens are acceptable (END-USER). Also, all entries must be in CAPITAL LETTERS. If listing several synonyms for a word, use a comma delimiter with NO SPACE between the synonyms. Other entries in a line can contain a space, it is only the first term in the line that cannot include a space. For example, let's say that you added the following line in the thesaurus.txt or aliases.txt file:  AARDVARK,ANTBEAR,ANTEATER  If an end user searches your answers using the word Â aardvark, answers that include the words aardvark, antbear, or anteater are returned. If the user instead searches on antbear, the answers containing the word aardvark are only returned if there is another line in the file that has antbear listed first on the line:  ANTBEAR,AARDVARK,ANTEATER  Then, to complete all searching opportunities for this example, a third line should be included in the synlist.txt file that has anteater first:  ANTEATER,ANTBEAR,AARDVARK  Note: When working with the aliases.txt and thesaurus.txt files, if you know that your answers include specific words and terminology, it may not be necessary to include a line for all combinations of synonyms or it may not be necessary to include all other entries from another line. For example, if you know that your answers only use the word aardvark and that the words antbear and anteater are not used in your answers, you can simplify your entries to be: ANTBEAR,AARDVARK ANTEATER,AARDVARK When you save the aliases or thesaurus file, the wltool utility should automatically run so that changes to the file take immediate effect on the search functionality of your end-user pages."

Incidents are updated with the entire incident thread;Answer ID 1662;;['Answer ID 2017', 'Answer ID 5168'];"   Incoming Email Oracle B2C Service, versions August 2013 and greater  Issue   When customers reply to an existing incident via email, the entire email may be added to the incident thread instead of just the new updated information.  Note: When the entire email would update the thread, a separate file attachment may be appended to the incident because of the size. The .txt attachment is typically named ""Attachment 1.txt"" and it contains the content of the email.";"  Oracle B2C Service (OSvC) lets customers update incidents by replying to email messages. Typically customers include the original message in their reply, quoting back the email they received with their reply at the top and sometimes a standard footer. When the Techmail utility detects an email reply, it attempts to identify the part of the message containing the customer's reply and strips out any text that may have been quoted back from the original message thread. In this way, new replies are added to the incident as a new entry in the incident thread while text from previous thread entries is ignored. A byte count/check sum method is used to determine what is outside the original email received from B2C Service whether above or below the original message. The outgoing message from B2C Service includes a tag line similar to the following. Â  Â This will be visible in the text/plain part of the message and hidden in the text/html part of the message. [---001:001111:46978---] This byte count/check sum is determined from the original message and calculated at the time it was sent. Â  Â If anything is added in the original message, then the byte count/check sum will not match and entire message is used to update the incident thread. For example, if a customer replies to multiple points within the original email, inter-mixing the reply with the original text, these changes are preserved in context of the original message and the entire email message is inserted into the incident thread. If you have updated the site from older versions and are still using the previous ""reply-between-the-lines"" methodology, please reference Â Answer ID 2017: Disabling ""reply-between-the-lines"" in incident responses Â to disable this feature. This methodology is typically no longer used.  Â  For additional information, refer to the Â 'Email Reply Processing' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Pop-up window blockers effect on Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 1665;How do pop-up window blockers affect Oracle B2C Service?;['Answer ID 2017', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Browsers, Pop-up blockers; In general, pop-up window blockers are very effective at what they do. Unfortunately, Oracle B2C Service is just as subject to the restrictions placed by these blockers as any other Web site. For this reason, we do not recommend having your support site pop up in a new window when accessed from your main Web site. Blocker programs are designed to be difficult to circumvent, and they work very well to prevent new browser windows from opening from a Web page. The effectiveness of these programs is in part due to the fact that the function being blocked is related to the browser window rather than to what is in the window. Thus, pop-up blockers on your customers' computers may prevent not only Oracle B2C Service from opening in a new window on your site, but could easily prevent other content from opening in a new window from a link on your site. Depending on the blocker program being used and its configuration, end-users who use a blocker program may not be able to use the following features:   Print Answer and E-mail Answer links  Related Answers  Suggested Solutions (after submitting an Ask a Question request)  Chat   For this reason, you may wish to add text next to the link which opens Oracle B2C Service, specifying that if a pop-up window blocker is running on the user's machine, it should be disabled before proceeding or, if the blocker program allows it, specify that pop-up windows from your site and application, i.e. http://interface.custhelp.com, should not be blocked.

Allowing other search engines to index the Oracle B2C Service application;Answer ID 1669;How can I modify the robots.txt file to allow search engines to index our site?;['Answer ID 2553', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 10427'];   Site Indexing Spiders, Robots, Search Engine Site Indexing;"  For Oracle B2C Service sites, Â a robots.txt file is installed Â on each interface. The robots.txt file prevents random spider searches that can be enacted against an Oracle B2C Service site. This file can be viewed at: http(s)://&lt;interface_name&gt;.custhelp.com/robots.txt or http(s)://vhostname/robots.txt The default file used on sites contains two lines: User-agent: * Disallow: / There are some standard rules for configuring robot.txt files. For information about building, modifying, and maintaining robots.txt files, refer to http://www.robotstxt.org. Â  Â NOTE: Robots.txt files cannot be altered for community sites. Most search engines code their spiders to look for these files and obey them. However, not everyone does -- especially email harvesters -- thus, the existence of the robots.txt file does not always mean that a spider cannot search your site. Allowing your Site to be Indexed: Customers can request that the robots.txt file be modified to allow site indexing. This would allow their site to be indexed by search engines, including Google, Yahoo, Bing, and so on. Many of these search engines have various robot agents that index sites. Some are standard (free), while others require content submission and/or are paid services. Each of the major search engines has a section on their web site devoted to configuration parameters for their robots. Also, there are exclusion parameters available that allow various pieces of a site to be indexed and others excluded. Every legitimate robot should have online content devoted to its proper configuration so that you can determine how your robots.txt file should be updated. Expand the section below to see a few common examples (though there are several other search engines): Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  Â Examples for Google, Yahoo and Bing Â   Google: http://www.google.com/webmasters/index.html http://www.google.com/services http://www.google.com/webmasters/bot.html Yahoo: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/helpcentral/ http://help.yahoo.com/kb/index?locale=en_US&amp;page=topics&amp;y=PROD_SRCH&amp;topics=TOP_WEBMSTR http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/privacy/access/indexing-13.html BING: http://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/fetch-as-bingbot-fe18fa0d  Prior to making changes: It is important that you review the appropriate information regarding robot configuration for that engine. Then, determine the content for your robots.txt file in accordance with what you want indexed. Â  With this feature enabled, Â common search engine's web bots are added to the robots.txt file. Then, submit your exact request regarding the change to your robots.txt file in an Ask Technical Support request. It is your responsibility as a customer to define the content of the robots.txt file if you wish to change it. In addition, if you have multiple interfaces, be sure to indicate which specific interfaces and robots.txt files are to be modified since each interface has its own file. -  Â Note that the search engines only look at the entries until they find the entry that applies to them. Â  Â So if the first entry on your robots.txt file is the default, this will allow every search engine to index your site and ignore following entries, regardless of what the following entries are. Â  Â  -  Â Please also note that our system will sometimes add entries below what you have specified in your robots.txt file, but as long as the first entry is not changed, this will not affect indexing.  Sitemaps: Â  This feature is enabled by default Â so that search engines can more easily catalog your site. For more information regarding sitemap, refer to Answer ID 2553: Using a sitemap with our Oracle B2C Service application. Additional information is available in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Creating a distribution list;Answer ID 1683;How can I create a distribution list?;['Answer ID 1796', 'Answer ID 551', 'Answer ID 1972', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Distribution Lists Oracle B2C Service;"  Distribution lists are email address lists that you can use when scheduling reports, configuring rule notifications, and forward a record. You can also use email address lists in the Â CC and BCC fields in incident responses. Distribution lists are used to define sets of email addresses not associated with contact records or staff accounts in your knowledge base. Any email address can be added or imported into a distribution lists. The email does not need to be associated with a staff account or contact record. This allows you to easily forward information to groups of people who are not typically logged in or involved with your Â Oracle B2C Service application. To configure a distribution list, use the steps below: Â   From Configuration, select Â Site Configuration &gt; Distribution Lists   To add a distribution list, click the New button on the ribbon to display the editor   To edit a distribution list, click it in the tree   Add a List Name (display name) Add or Import addresses Click Save  NOTE: The Distribution List editor consists of a list of all available addresses. Addresses are included or not included in the distribution list by selecting/de-selecting the check box next to them in the list.

Rebuilding and reindexing the phrases table;Answer ID 1684;;['Answer ID 1309'];   Answer and Incident Phrase Searching, Wordlist files Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Adding or Removing Words to the Exclude Files  For a description of the exclude files, refer to Answer ID 1309: Excluding Words and Phrases from Searching. If you have only added words to one of the exclude wordlist Â  Â files, you do not need to rebuild your phrases table. Adding words to these files does two things. It prevents the newly added words from being indexed into the phrases table the next time an answer or incident is added. It also excludes keywords entered in a search from being compared to the values in the existing phrases table. Note: If you add several words to the file, consider rebuilding the phrases table anyway so that the overall size of the table can be reduced. Reducing the size of the phrases table can improve the speed of searches performed on your site.  If you have removed words from one or more of the exclude files, you do need to rebuild the phrases table. When you remove a word from either file, you are indicating that it should be included in a search. As a result, the incidents or answers need to be reindexed so that the words that were removed from the file(s) are now indexed and searchable.   Rebuilding the Phrases Tables  The phrases table for answers is separate from the phrases table for your incidents. To rebuild the phrases tables, the keywordindexer-k/keywordindexer-f utility must be run for your site in order for the words in the incidents and/or answers to be reindexed according to the new contents of the file. If you do not rebuild the index, changes to the text file (namely, the removal of words from the file) will apply ONLY to incidents and answers that are created or edited after the file was modified. The process of reindexing your incidents and/or answers may take several hours depending on the number of incidents and answers in your knowledge base.  Taking the site off-line: When keywordindexer-f is run against your site, you can choose whether or not Â to take your site off-line.  For Hosted Customers:  If you have edited one or more of the exclude files, in order to reindex your keywords, we must run keywordindexer Â for your site. To request this action to be taken, Â submit an Ask Technical Support request to our Technical Support staff. In the assistance request, include the name of your site and which file you edited.

Restore option after updating;Answer ID 1688;;['Answer ID 1309'];   All Oracle B2C Service (OSvC) Implementations;  After your site updates, a backup of your site on the previous version is stored for 96 hours. If you find any issues with your production site after update, submit a service request to Â Ask Technical Support Â explaining the issue. At this time, we will work with you to determine if there is a workaround or a patch Â for the issue reported. In rare circumstances, when an acceptable resolution to a site down issue cannot be identified, your site can be restored to the state it was prior to cutover. This option should be used judiciously as it:  Causes the loss of all new data (service requests, contacts, etc.) from the time of the cutover until the time of the restore. Introduces additional downtime.  Therefore, this Â should be considered Â only as a Â last resort. Update Â retreats are executed at Oracle's sole discretion. Due to the data loss involved, Oracle requires written permission from someone at high level within the customer's organization, acknowledging that he/she understands the following:  There is data loss involved in the site restore. The downtime will be extended until the site restore Â is complete. We are unable to tell how long the site restore Â process will take. The production is still locked into that target version, and you must update Â to that version before updating Â to a newer version. We need to re-create the upgrade site, re-engineer and have that tested by your QA team before we can attempt to update Â the production site again i.e. the project schedule is extended.  The site restore Â process works as follows:  The customer obtains permission from someone at management level as above. A service request requesting a site restore Â is submitted to Oracle, containing the written permission from step 1. Oracle team will obtain internal approval from Oracle management. The site is taken down for maintenance to perform site restore. The duration of the downtime cannot be calculated in advance. Site restore completion notification is sent to the customer.  Notes: Example: If your site is cutover to the new Â version at 2:00 A.M. and you determine at 1:00 P.M. that you need to restore, you would lose all new Â data captured between 2:00 A.M. Â and 1:00 P.M.

For more information on robots, refer to Answer ID 1669: Allowing other search engines to index the Oracle B2C Service application. Utilizing the robots.txt file is a good solution. Along with the statistical recording benefits, it also optimizes the end-user pages for spiders. Unfortunately not all web spiders obey robots.txt rules and may by pass the robots.txt file and be included in your stats. In these cases, you will want to include the user agent of the spider in the SEC_SPIDER_USER_AGENT configuration setting. For more information on this setting, please see the following answer: Answer ID 4280: Spider Bots.

Ability to drill down in scheduled reports;Answer ID 1729;How can I set up the report subscription to allow someone to drill down into the incidents?;['Answer ID 2447'];  Analytics, All versions; It is not possible to drill-down in a scheduled report Â from a report subscription. This is due to the potential to have to send excessive amounts of data that may be included in multiple drill-down levels. In order to drill down to lower levels of a report, you must generate the report from the administration pages of your RightNow application. While drill-down functionality is not available with scheduled reports, you can redefine the report to include all data of interest to the recipient. Â  That is, you can define the report to include all of the drill-down data in a single level report or you can create a dashboard or container that includes data from several reports, including the top-level report and supporting levels of data. You can create a dashboard to run several reports at the same time. You can create one report for the top level and then another report for the appropriate drill-down level(s). Then, within a dashboard, you can include both reports so that when the dashboard is sent both the top level and appropriate drill-down data is listed together. For more information on creating dashboards, refer to Answer ID 2447: Creating dashboards to run multiple reports at the same time.

Notifying a staff member when an answer is proposed;Answer ID 1732;Can I notify a staff member when an answer is proposed from an incident?;['Answer ID 2447'];   Answers, Business Rules, Message Templates Oracle B2C Service,Ã‚Â All versions;"  You can set up answer rules to automatically modify and assign answers that have been proposed from incidents. By default, when an incident is proposed as an answer, the answer that is created has a Proposed status and is unassigned to a staff member. You can configure a rule to either assign the proposed answer to a specific staff member so that they receive the Answer Assigned notification or you can configure a rule to send the Answer Escalated notification to specific staff members. To use either of these options, the proper notification must be enabled for the interface. To determine if the answer notification is enabled, use the steps below:  From the Configuration menu, Â select Site Configuration &gt; Message Templates In the left frame, double click on the interface name   On the ribbon there is an Administrator Notification button   Expand Answer templates Verify that the Answer Assigned (or Answer ""Owner"") Â notification is enabled Verify that the Answer Escalation notification is also enabled Save and Close  Option 1: Assigning the Proposed Answer to a Specific Staff Member Â  When a rule assigns the answer to a specific staff member, the staff member will receive the Answer Assigned notification at the Configuration &gt; Â Communication Center &gt; Notifications. The assigned to staff member only receives the notification when another staff member proposes the incident as an answer. If the staff member proposes the answer, and the answer gets assigned to them, the system does not send the notification. To set up an answer rule so that the assigned staff member gets notified, use the steps below. These steps also include instruction for creating an initial and existing rule state for your answer rules, which follow best practice recommendations.  From Site Configuration &gt; select Rules &gt; Then highlight Answer and Edit in the ribbon at the top. Â  In the left frame, right click on States and select New State. Enter the name for your initial state, i.e. Internal or Created, check the Initial state checkbox and click Save. You can enter a note if you wish. Add a second state for your existing answers, i.e. named Existing, for example. Leave the Initial state box blank. Right click on your initial state and select Add Rule. Enter a rule name. Configure the IF conditions to be: IF Answers.Status equals Proposed and Answers.Assigned equals Unspecified. In the THEN section, click Add Action and select Set Field &gt; Assigned and highlight the appropriate staff member. You can also add another action to transition the answer to another state and stop. This will move the answer to your other rule state so that this rule does not act upon existing answers. Click Save. Click Activate and verify that you would like to activate your answer rulebase. If you have answers in your database that do not yet have a state, you can associate the answers to the rule state to be used for existing answers.  To test your rules, have a staff member propose an incident as an answer. The person to whom the answer gets assigned can refresh their Communication Center, and they should see the Answer Assigned notification.  Option 2: Sending the Answer Escalation Notification Â  Another option you can use to notify staff members of proposed answers is to use a different action in the THEN section of the answer rule. Click Add Action &gt; Email &gt; Send Escalation Notification. You can then highlight the staff members to whom the escalation notification should be sent. Those staff members will receive the Answer Escalation notification in their Communication Center."

Best Practices for setting up your knowledge base of answers;Answer ID 1733;As a new customerÃ‚Â to Oracle B2C Service,Ã‚Â where can I find information about setting up our public knowledge base of answers?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 1447'];   Answers, Getting started creating a knowledge base Oracle B2C Service;  Before Â you develop your knowledge base, it is important to understand the process for publishing answers. Frequently, the need for a new public answer will arise from a question submitted by a customer. When agents resolve an issue and recognize the need for an answer, they can create a publicly viewable answer. The following process outlines the steps for efficiently capturing information and creating answers:  Step 1: Define a process for proposing new answers. Step 2. Define an approval review process for new answers. Step 3. Determine the audience of new answers. Step 4. Determine the display position of new answers. Step 5. Notify staff of new answers.  For additional information, refer to the 'Defining a process for publishing and reviewing answers' Â section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Note: This answer is not intended to provide comprehensive training or comprehensive implementation steps regarding use of Â Oracle B2C Service Â or the Answer editor. The intent of this Â reference is Â to provide a high-level description of features and processes to evaluate when determining how Â Oracle B2C Service Â will be used within your organization. For more information on getting started in Â answer creation, refer to the 'Seeding your knowledge base' and 'Creating effective answers' sections in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Â To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Staff cannot find contact or organization record even though we know it exists;Answer ID 1739;;['Answer ID 1998'];   Contacts and Organizations, Staff Profile Permissions Oracle B2C Service;  When using Quick Search, a staff member's search may not return the record of interest, depending on the Â report and profile configurations in your site. This includes any type of record used with the Quick Search feature, including organizations, contacts, incidents, and sales opportunities.  CX State  When performing quick searches on contacts or organizations in the Â Outreach and Service modules, the quick search defaults set the corresponding CX state to be enabled. That is, using quick search at the Support Console uses a default CX State to have the Service state enabled, but not the Â Opportunities or Outreach states. As a result, if you are searching for an Outreach contact from the Support Console, but use the quick search defaults, the record will not be returned. This is because that contact only has the Outreach Â state and not the Service CX state enabled. In these situations, when using quick search to search for a record that you know is in the database, but you are unsure of the CX State for that record, enable all three options for the CX field when you do the quick search. Note that some staff members may still be affected by the profile and views restrictions as discussed below and they might not be able to access the record. For more information on the CX State field, refer to Answer ID 1998: State field with contact and organization records.  Profile and Â Report Considerations  If a staff member's profile does not have the Edit Administration box checked, the view specified for use at the console determines which records can be pulled up using the Quick Search feature. This is based on the fixed filters used in the view. This functionality is designed to prevent staff members with restricted access to incidents from being able to pull up incidents that their report does not allow access to. If the staff has access to multiple reports but cannot edit those reports, the most liberal Â report (that allows access to the most records) determines which records can be returned. That is, if all reports that can be accessed by a staff member have the same fixed filters, then the data is restricted based on the fixed filters. If the Â reports do not share the same fixed filters, then the record can be accessed using Quick Search only if it can be accessed from any one of the reports. If any of the reports have no fixed filters, then the staff member can access any of the records from the Quick Search menu. As a result, if the staff member's profile is set up with both of the following conditions, the staff member may not be able to access an incident even if it exists in the database:  The staff member's profile does not have the Edit Administration option enabled. Â    The staff member's default Â report for the Support Console includes fixed filters. That is, if the default view restricts which incidents are shown by default, only those incidents are accessible by the quick search feature.

Answers are listed several times in our custom report;Answer ID 1740;Why are answers listed multiple times inÃ‚Â our custom report of published answers?;['Answer ID 1998'];  Answers, Analytics;" If an answer is listed multiple times in a report, it is because the answer is assigned to multiple products or categories, and the product or category field is listed in the output. If an answer is assigned to multiple products or categories, it will be listed once for each value and combined values it is set to. For example, if an answer is assigned to product A and B and category 1 and 2. If the report lists the answer ID and the product and category fields in the output, the answer will be listed four times, once for each of the combinations below: Product A -- Category 1 Product A -- Category 2 Product B -- Category 1 Product B -- Category 2 You can include an expression in your report to list an individual value or to list the word ""Multiple"" if the answer is assigned to more than one value. The expression counts Â the number of products, sub-products,categories or sub-categories (depending on how your site is configured). The expression is similar to the following: count(if(answers.map_prod_lvlx_id &gt; 1,'Multiple',answers.map_prod_lvlx_id)) Be sure to replace ""x"" in the expression with the appropriate level of the item Â you are counting. For example to count the number of sub-products, you would use ""2"" to use the answers.map_prod_lvl2 field from the database. Similarly, if you need to count the number of categories or sub-categories, replace ""prod"" with ""cat"" so that the correct database field is referenced. For example, to count the number of categories an answer is assigned to, use the answers.map_cat_lvl1 field in the expression."

"Keyword Search report includes many misspellings or ""invalid query""";Answer ID 1741;"Why is it in theÃ‚Â Keyword Search report, the words and phrases are frequently misspelled, i.e. ""interfac"" orÃ‚Â ""upgrad"", and sometimes I see ""&lt;invalid query&gt;""Ã‚Â ?";['Answer ID 1998'];  Phrase Searching, Analytics Oracle B2C Service, All versions;" The Keyword Search report does not show keywords and phrases exactly as your customers typed them. The entries listed in the Keyword Search report are the stemmed versions of the words and phrases entered into the Search field on your end-user pages. Stemming allows the database to search on different variations of a specific word. For example, if you search on the word ""typing"", the database is also searched for type, typed, types, and retype, and answers that include any of those words are returned in the search results. In this case, the stemmed root of this word is ""typ"" which is what is listed if you generate the Keyword Search report. Typically, if the word in the report is misspelled at the end of the word, such as a missing ""e"", ""s"", or ""ing"", or when the stem ends in an ""i"" instead of a ""y"", this is due to the stemming algorithm. However, in cases where the word is misspelled in the middle of the word, such as ""signitur"" or ""priveledg"", this indicates that the word was misspelled during the search. In the Keyword Search report, it is not possible to get a list of non-stemmed words and phrases that were searched on. Only the search string that is used by Oracle B2C Service to search the knowledge base is included in the report. If a search is not performed on a search string, either because the words in the search string are in the stopwords list or the string is composed entirely of punctuation, then the Phrase Stem listed will be ""&lt;invalid_query&gt;."" For example, if the words ""technical"" and ""support"" are listed in your answers stopwords list, and a customer searches for ""technical support,"" then the Keyword Search report will show a Phrase Stem of ""&lt;invalid_query&gt;"" Â not a Search String of ""technical support."""

Values of the Operator field when configuring report filters;Answer ID 1744;What are the values of the Operator field for filters when configuring custom reports?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics;"  When configuring filters in a report, the options listed in the Operator field depend on the type of field selected. Note that wildcards are not allowed with any of the first Â eight operators listed below: =, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, not equals or null, Â and between. If you are using wildcards, you must use the like or not like operators. For this reason, when using text fields, it is most common to use the like or not like operators. When using the like operators -- like, not like, and not like or null: you should generally use a wildcard (%) to surround your value. For example, if you want to include all fields that contain the word 'all,' you should type '%all%' (including the single quotation marks) in the value field.   Operators and Descriptions     Operator  Description       equals Â (=)  The field matches the value exactly, including case.     not equals  (!=)  The field does not match the value listed.     not equals or  The field does not match the value listed or the field is a null value.     less than Â   (&lt;)  The field is numerically less than the value listed.     less than  or equals (&lt;=)  The field is numerically less than or equal to the value listed.     greater than (&gt;)  The field is numerically greater than the value listed.     greater than or equals Â (&gt;=)  The field is numerically greater than or equal to the value listed.     between  The field falls between two specified values, including the endpoints. That is, if the between range is from 1 to 100, values that equal 1 or 100 match. When using this option, click in the Value or Expression 2 cell to enter the range of values.     like  The field matches the value that is listed. When using the like expression, you should generally use the % sign (wildcards) to surround your value. For example, if you were looking for all fields that contain the word ""all"", you should type %all% in the value field.     not like  The field does not match the value that is listed. When using the like expression, you generally should use the % sign (wildcards) to surround your value. For example, if you were looking for all fields that do not contain the word ""all"", you should type %all% in the value field.     not like or null  The field is either a null value or does not match the expression listed. You can use wildcards with this option.     in list  The field matches one of the drop-down menu items selected. (Used only with menu-type fields.)     not in list  The field does not match any of the menu items selected. When using this operator with integer fields, the numbers in the Value field must be comma-separated. When using this operator with text fields, the text strings in the Value field must be comma-separated and each text string must be offset by single quotes (for example, Ã¢â‚¬ËœredÃ¢â‚¬â„¢,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢greenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢orangeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢). Spaces between entries are ignored.     is null  The field contains no data in the database and is a null value. Note: This operator is not available in run-time selectable filters.     is not null  The field contains some type of data in the database. Note: This operator is not available in run-time selectable filters.     != or null  The field is either a null value or does not match the value exactly, including case. Wildcards are not allowed with this field.     complex expression  The field matches the expression listed in the value. This operator is only allowed with text fields and automatically includes a trailing wildcard however, it does not include a preceding wildcard for the search.     != or null  The field does not match the expression listed in the value. This operator is only allowed with text fields and automatically includes a trailing wildcard. To use the NULL filters in reports you need to uncheck the check box that says, ""Make this filter selectable at run time."", in the filters.     Note: In order to see null value operators you will need to:  Open your filter. Uncheck ""Make this filter selectable at run time."" The Operator drop down menu will now have additional options.  For additional information, refer to the Filter Operators Â section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Reports have different totals for same group of data;Answer ID 1748;;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Grouping Results;"  It is very important when adding aggregate columns to reports Â that you fully understand the data set being used. Especially in cases where you are counting a group of distinct items, the results can differ depending on which element you are counting and how those items are grouped. For example, even a simple data Â set gives different results depending on how the data Â is grouped and counted. Sample Â data set: 1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,6  Â  Case 1: If you use a count distinct function on the data set above, you get 6 as the Â result Â since there are only 6 distinct values of the 10 data points listed. Case 2: If the data is grouped as illustrated below, however, the count can differ.  Group 1: 1, 2 (2 distinct values) Group 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (5 distinct values) Group 3: 6, 1, 6 (2 distinct values)  In this case, a Â count of distinct values may return 9 (2+5+2) because values are duplicated in the subsets that you may not intend.Therefore, when comparing reports it is strongly recommended that you consider the grouping used within the report.  Â  Example: Let's assume you have two aggregate columns, each displaying a count of distinct answer IDs grouped by the interface (interface 1 &amp; interface 2) Column #1 expression: Â count(distinct(if(ans_stats.interface_id=1, ans_stats.a_id))) Column #2 expression: Â count(distinct(if(ans_stats.interface_id=2, ans_stats.a_id)))  Â  Ultimately, you want to display a total count of unique answer IDs from ans_stats across all interfaces. Thus you create the following two columns: Total #1 colum expression: Â count(distinct ans_stats.a_id) Total #2 column expression: Â count(distinct(if(ans_stats.interface_id=1, ans_stats.a_id)))+count(distinct(if(ans_stats.interface_id=8, ans_stats.a_id)))  Â  Initially you may expect these both to return the same value. The 'Total #1' column disregards the interface value while the 'Total #2' column simply adds the unique count of both interfaces Â together. However, if you have an answer ID row associated to both interfaces in ans_stats that value will be duplicated in the 'Total #2' column and the 'Total #1' column is the true count of unique answer IDs from ans_stats across all interfaces. ex. Total #1  Â   Â   Â   Â   Â Total #2  Â   Â   Â   Â   Â Column #1  Â   Â   Â   Â   Â Column #2  Â   Â   Â   Â   Â 30  Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â 33  Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â 30  Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â 3"

Not displaying agent's name in incident responses and chat sessions;Answer ID 1752;How do we keep from having the agent's name from being displayed to the customer when responding to an incident or chat session?;['Answer ID 538', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Staff Account Display Name, Incident Thread Entries;"  To prevent the staff member's name from displaying to the end-user, edit their staff account and modify the Display Name field to be something more generic, such as ""Support Agent"" or simply the staff member's first name. The content of the Display Name Â field Â is used in the email response for an incident and in the chat thread viewed by the end-user. This allows you to configure a more generic name or title to Â be used when corresponding with your end-users. From the administration console, the first and last name fields configured in the staff account Â display in the incident thread and chat window. Â  This allows you to easily determine which staff member acted on an incident or chat. Â  That way, if you set the Display Name to be identical for several staff members, you can still distinguish which staff member sent a response when viewing the incident from the administration pages.

Â  Â By default, the account/profile.php file includes several widgets for various contact fields, including the alternate email fields, address fields and five phone fields. Â  The utils/create_account.php file does not include these widgets by default. Â You can edit the create_account.php file to add these widgets to allow end-users the ability to create a new account from the end-user pages. The FormInput widget is used multiple times Â to add each address and phone field separately. Â  The name attribute identifies which specific table and Â field to include. This attribute should be in the form 'table.field'. The available options for the table are 'contacts' and 'incidents'.

Associating a contact to an organization record;Answer ID 1761;How do I associate a contact to an organization in our site?;['Answer ID 538', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Contacts and Organizations Oracle B2C Service;  You can only move contact records based on the permissions granted in your staff profile. The Contacts tab includes a Move column for the different combinations of states (Service, Outreach, and Opportunities). You can only move an existing Â contact if your profile has the Move checkbox enabled for the state associated with the contact record. For example, if a profile does not have the Move box enabled for any record that has the Service state enabled, the staff member using that profile cannot move Service contacts to be associated with a different organization. Staff can associate a contact to an organization either from the contact record or from the organization. The staff profile must allow Â the staff member Â to edit contact and/or organization records. In addition, the contact or organization workspace must include the appropriate controls and relationship items to allow contacts and organizations to be associated.  To associate an organization from the contact record:  Open the contact record for editing.   Click the magnifying glass icon next to the Organization ID field or right click on the Organization ID field and click Search.   Search for the organization record by name.   In the search results, highlight the row for the organization and click Select.   When the window closes, the organization name displays in the ID field.   Save the contact record.  To associate a contact to an organization record:  Open the organization record for editing.   Click the Contacts tab.   Click Add and select either Add New Contact or Â Add Existing. Â  Add New creates a new contact record while Add Existing moves an already existing contact to be associated with the organization.   If adding a new contact, fill out the fields in the New Contact window and click OK. Â   Â  If adding an existing contact, search for the contact record using the pop-up window, highlight the record in the search results and click Select.   Save the organization record. Â  Important!

Adding custom tabs to workspaces;Answer ID 1765;Can I add custom tabs when editing records in Oracle B2C Service?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2429'];Editing Custom Workspaces;" You can add custom tabs to Â individual workspaces used by the staff members or staff group of interest. Â  This allows you to include the tab and information for some staff members and not display the tab to other staff who use different workspaces. For comprehensive information on workspaces, refer to the 'Custom Workspaces' section in online documentation for your release. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  To customize a workspace, you can Â copy an existing workspace and then edit the copy to create a new workspace for your staff. Â  If you create a new workspace for use, be sure to modify the appropriate staff profiles to use your new workspace. Otherwise, you can edit a custom workspace directly, in which case you do not have to modify the staff profile. To add a custom tab to a workspace, use the steps below. Â   From the Â Configuration Items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces / Workflows.   In the Workspaces Explorer, double-click on the workspace of interest to open and Edit.   If the workspace already has a tab set, right click in the white are to the left of the first tab or the white area to the right of the last tab and select Add Tab.  If the workspace does not have a tab set, you must add a tab set to the workspace. Click the Insert Control tab in the ribbon and drag the Tab Set icon onto the workspace.   Drag fields and controls from the toolbox to the tab.   Save the changes to your workspace.  When adding a browser to a custom tab, you can pass variables through the URL so that information for specific records populate the page. For more information on passing variables through a URL, refer to Answer ID 2429 Including a variable on a custom tab or custom link. Note: You can also add sub-tabs to the tab you just added. From the Toolbox, drag and drop a Tab Set control onto the body of the tab. Then, within the tab set, you can add fields and controls just as you can for a primary tab set.  Mailing editor: Â  To add a custom tab or tabs to the Mailing editor, you can edit the MAILING_EDITOR_TABS configuration setting. This setting specifies the custom tabs to include in the Mailing editor. Custom tabs can be created to view custom content on the console. The custom tab definition must include a tab title and a URL. Separate tab entries with a carriage return. The default value is blank. Â  For example: (tab(""RightNow Home Page"",http://www.oracle.com/rightnow)) This tab would be labeled RightNow Home Page, and its content would display the URL at http://www.oracle.com/rightnow. You can also use merge fields to include attributes of the mailing in query string parameters of the custom tab URL. An example for this setting that uses a merge field is as follows: (tab(""RightNow Home Page"",http://www.oracle.com/rightnow)) (tab(""Revenue"",http://rightnow.com/revenue?report.php?mailing=$mailing.mailing_id))  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key."

Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. You can create Â two types of mailings: Broadcast -- this type of mailing is sent to an audience you specify at a time that you choose.  Â  Transactional -- this Â type of mailing is triggered by an event. The email is sent when a specific action that you define occurs, such as an event in a marketing campaign or when a rule is matched.  Â  To create a new mailing, Â from the navigation bar, select New &gt; Mailing. You can also click the Mailings navigation button and open the Mailings Explorer and click New from the explorer toolbar. The new mailing defaults to be a broadcast mailing. To change the mailing to be a transactional mailing, from the Summary tab, click the Change link next to the Mailing Method and click Transactional in the pop-up window. Mailing tabs: When you create a new mailing, the tabs in the mailing Â record allow you to configure and review different aspects of your mailing. Â  Note: When creating a mailing from existing content, documents you have created Â will not be listed in the Choose Â Document window unless the Approve for Email box is checked Â on the Summary tab of Â the document.  Â  Summary: Allows staff to view the high-level features associated with the mailing, including who the mailing is assigned, what type it is, and notes, tasks, and attachments associated with the mailing.  Â  Audience: Allows you to define who can receive your mailing. For transactional mailings, the audience is defined by the trigger event. Â  However, you can define an audience to exclude from receiving the transactional mailing.  Â  In addition, you also define the frequency and recency of communication to your contacts as well as whether to honor the global opt-in and external suppression lists.  Â  Message: This is where you define the subject Â line of Â the email to be sent along with the Â content, including snippets (blocks of reusable content), Â links, or merge fields. Â  NOTE: When choosing existing content, you have the option to 'Copy' or 'Share' selected content. Â  Â  Copy - To make modifications to the mailing without affecting the source document. Â  Â  Share - To have edits reflected in all instances where the document is referenced.  Â   Â Proofing: Â  Allows you to send proof messages to select recipients for review and approval. Â  You can only send proof messages if the Message tab has a subject defined and has content added for the message. Â   Notes: Â   When a Proof is sent, although you can step through an entire campaign as if it was live, any fields to be updated Â for example, custom opt-in fields, or form fields, will not get updated. Â  Â Such updates happen only when running a live mailing/campaign. Â  The Â data for Surveys/Mailings filled out in proof mode will be available for 7 days, after which will be purged from the question_sessions table by the agedatabase utility. The 7 days setting is not configurable.  Â    Delivery: Once the mailing has been proofed, you can launch the mailing. For broadcast mailings, you can schedule when to send it and how many to send within a time frame.  Â  For transactional mailings, you must launch the mailing before it can be used in a campaign or rule. Â  After a mailing has been launched, you can use the Suspend button to temporarily halt the mailing or you can use the Cancel Mailing button to permanently disable the mailing from being sent. Â  Once a mailing has been launched, it cannot be modified or re-sent. Â  A copy of the mailing would Â need to Â be created in such a case.  Â  Results: For mailings that have been launched, use the Results tab to view statistics associated specifically to that mailing such as delivery statistics, tracked link, and click-through activity.  The overall process for creating and sending a mailing is listed below: Initial Planning: Determine the purpose of the email to be sent out and identify basic content and audience to whom it will be sent.  Â  Create Document: In the Document Console, create your document, including necessary file attachments and tracked links. Â   Â  Create the Audience: In the Audience Console, create the audience to whom your email will be sent. For more information on creating audience segments and lists in Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service, refer to Answer ID 1954: Creating a contact list or a segment for a mailing or survey.

Adding countries and provinces to the Oracle B2C Service menu fields;Answer ID 1768;How do I add a country and provinces for use in ourÃ‚Â Oracle B2C ServiceÃ‚Â application?;['Answer ID 1847', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Countries / Provinces, May 2010 and newer;  The Countries / Provinces table allows you to define countries for use with contact and organization records. The country that is selected when creating a contact or organization sets the format used with telephone numbers, postal codes, and provinces and territories for that country. Phone masks and postal masks are optional when configuring a country. For more information on creating masks, refer to Answer ID 1847: Setting a specific format or mask for custom text fields. By default, the US and its states and territories are included in the Countries / Provinces table. Other countries and associated provinces can be added manually. Adding new organization and contacts: When adding a new organization in Oracle B2C Service, the Country field is blank. The user must first set the Country field before they can add a state or province, or postal code. By selecting the country first, the system then determines which states or provinces are appropriate along with any postal code masks. When creating a new contact record, the Country field defaults to the Default Country value set in the staff member's account. For example, if the staff account has a default country set to Canada, when that staff member creates a new contact in any console, the default country will be set to Canada. To add a new country to the Country field, use the steps below:  Click the Configuration button on the Navigation pane. Double-Click Countries under Internationalization. The Countries tree displays on the content pane. To add a country, click the New button on the ribbon to display the editor. Or to edit a country, click it in the tree. To add a province, click the Add button (in the Provinces section on the right side of the editor) to add a field in the Name column, and type the province name in the field. To edit the name of a province associated with the country you are editing, select the province name and type the new name. Click the Save and Close button on the ribbon to save the country and provinces before closing the editor.  To delete a country: Once a country has been added, you can only delete that entry if it is not used in a contact record, a staff account record, or in an organization record. If the country is used in any record, you must first edit the record(s) to set the country field to another value. To delete a state or province: Â You can delete a province or state within the country. Records that had been set to that value become null for that field. Custom reports: You can create a custom report or view that filters records on the country or province of interest and then edit the appropriate records. Once the value is no longer used in any record, you can go to the Countries / Provinces table. When you right click on the country, select the Delete option in the menu.  For additional information, refer to the 'Add or Edit a Country or Province' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Affecting the weight used with search results;Answer ID 1771;How can I affect the weighting used with search results?;['Answer ID 1960'];   Answer phrase searching Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  When an answer is saved, words contained in the answer and words contained in indexed files attached to the answer are written to the ans_phrases table. Â  Â In the process, each word is given a Ã¢â‚¬Å“weightÃ¢â‚¬Â. Â  Â Any word appearing in the exclude_answers.txt file will not be added as a search word. Â  Â The exclude_answers.txt file contains very common words. The weight will be increased the more times a word or phrase appears in an answer. Â  Â Multiple-word phrases (up to 3 words in length) are also added to ans_phrases. Â  Â These receive higher weights than single words. Â  Â  Weighting affects phrases searching for answers on the end-user pages and when searching for answers on the administration pages. Weighting affects incidents when phrase searching is done on the administration pages and at the My Â Account &gt; Questions page. Seven configuration settings allow you to customize how heavily words in each field are weighted when end-users search for answers on your site. Higher numerical values indicate increased weighting for words and phrases in that field. These weights are also used when the system determines suggested solutions to assistance requests submitted via the Ask a Question page as well as when an agent clicks the Suggestion button when editing an incident. Words are weighted more heavily depending on their location within the answer. Â  Â   By default the fields are weighted in the order below, from the highest to the lowest weights:     Configuration Setting  Field Affected  Default Value       SRCH_PROD_WEIGHT  Product field set for published answers  50     SRCH_CAT_WEIGHT  Category field set for published answers  50     SRCH_KEY_WEIGHT  Keywords field in published answers  50     SRCH_SUBJ_WEIGHT  Summary field in answers and Subject field of incidents  45     SRCH_DESC_WEIGHT  Question field in published answers  30     SRCH_BODY_WEIGHT  Answer field in published answers Â and the thread entries of incidents Â   4     SRCH_ATTACH_WEIGHT  Words used in files attached to published answers  4     Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings. These settings give a way of adjusting the relative importance of different parts of an Answer in the ranking of search results. The numbers allowed for the weights must be in the range 0-9999. Only the relative weights matter; doubling each weight will not affect the result ranking. The keywordindexer utility does not need to be run if these are changed. The actual number returned as the match weight seen by users (if specified in the report) is normalized to give 100 as the best possible match."

Viewing the incident history of an organization or contact;Answer ID 1774;How can I view the entire incident history?;['Answer ID 2509'];   Accounts/Profiles, Workspaces Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Staff can view incident history from either a contact or organization workspace or from a custom report. Workspaces: Â  Â In order to access the incident history for a contact or organization, the staff profile must allow access to the contact or organization editor (workspace). This means that the staff profile must Â have edit Â privileges enabled Â for the contact or organization records that is enabled on the Common tab of the profile. Â  View privileges in the profile do not allow access to the workspace. Note: Even with edit rights, you can define a workspace that only has read-only permissions for editing fields for the contact or organization. Â  That is, the edit permissions from the profile allow access to the workspace, but the workspace defines whether the staff member can actually edit the fields. Within the workspace, include the Incident View relationship item on a tab. The Incident View relationship item displays incidents associated with the record used Â in the workspace. Â  The default workspaces within the application already Â include the Incident View relationship item, so if you copy the workspace to create a Â custom workspace for your staff, Â the copy will include the incident history. Custom reports: If your staff do not have access to the organization or contact workspace due to restricted permissions in their staff profile, you can create a custom report that displays Â the incident history for a specific organization or contact record. Within the report, include a filter for organization name Â and any other common search fields (such as an org ID field). Â With contacts, you can include filters for first and last name or email address. Â  Then for the output column list the Â incident fields of your choice. Â  For more information on creating custom reports, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a Basic Custom Report.

Customizing the shortcut keys used in workspaces;Answer ID 1776;Can I customize theÃ‚Â shortcut keys usedÃ‚Â in the various workspaces?;['Answer ID 2509'];  Workspaces, Shortcut keys, Accelerator keys, fields;" The Â shortcut keys Â (also called accelerator keys) Â used with different fields are indicated by an underlined character. The character used as the shortcut key is defined in the configuration of the workspace. When editing a workspace, when you click on a field, the Label Text property allows you to define a Â shortcut key Â by adding an ampersand (&amp;) immediately prior to the shortcut key. For example, in an incident workspace, the shortcut key for the Status field is ""u"" by default. The Label Text property for that field in the workspace is Stat&amp;us. To set a shortcut key for the field, click the Text button on the Design tab, enter a label for the field, and type an ampersand (&amp;) in front of the character you want to be the shortcut key. For example, to allow staff members to move the focus to a field with the label ""Details"" by pressing Alt-t, type De&amp;tails. You can also add shortcut keys for custom fields the same way. For example, if you have a custom field named Version, you could set the Label Text property for that field to be &amp;Version so that the Alt-Shift-V is the shortcut key. If Â multiple fields have the same hot key defined, when you click Alt+shortcut key, the cursor goes to the first field listed. If you click Alt+shortcut key Â again, the cursor goes to the next field that has the Â shortcut key and so on. To edit a Â shortcut for a field used in a workspace, use the steps below. If you wish to edit a default workspace, you must copy the default and save it to a different location. Then, after editing the copy Â of the workspace, Â be sure to update the staff profile to call out the edited copy. From the Configuration Items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces/Workflows. Â   Â  Navigate to the folder and location of the workspace to edit. Â   Â  Right click on the workspace and select Â Open. Â   Â  Within the workspace, click on the field. Â   Â  Edit the Label Text property to include an ampersand immediately preceding the hotkey you wish to use. Â   Â  Click Save. Â   Â  If you copied the workspace to edit the copy, update the staff profile to call out the edited workspace."

In the View Options section, set the Color Scheme to blue, grey or silver and click OK. Color options in workspaces: Â  Within a workspace, you can also change the color of the title bars used in that workspace. This allows you to customize different workspaces used by your staff. For example, you can use different colors for workspaces from different interfaces. To modify the color of the title bar, use the steps below: Open the workspace for editing. If the workspace is a standard one, you must copy the workspace and then modify the staff profile to use the copied workspace.  Â  To add a new title bar, drag and drop the title bar control from the Controls section of the toolbox.  Â  Within the workspace designer, click the title bar.  Â  Change the Background property. Click in the property field and click the button on the right of the field to open the color picker.  Â  Select the color of interest and click OK.

Verifying that privileged access is set up correctly;Answer ID 1779;How can I verify that privileged access is set up correctly?;['Answer ID 1838', 'Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 2163'];   Privileged Access, Access Levels, Service Level Agreements;"  When working with privileged access, you may need to verify several features to ensure that answers are displaying as expected. See Answer ID 1838: Setting up privileged access Â for more information. There are typically two different issues that arise when privileged access is set incorrectly. The first is that customers who do not have privileged access can see the privileged answers. The second is that customers who should be able to see privileged answers cannot see them. Each of these cases are addressed below. Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  Non-Privileged Customers Can See Privileged Answers  This behavior generally indicates that the privileged access level has been enabled for enduser visibility. Â  To correct this, use the steps below: Step 1: First, verify that the answer is assigned to a public status and an access level that is not Everyone. That is, make sure the answer is assigned to one of your custom access levels used for privileged access.  Step 2: Verify that the access level for the answer is actually a privileged access level.  a) Go to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Customizable Menus &gt; System Menus b) From the Â Answer Access Levels list, click on the access level and verify the ""Visibility"" check box is clear. Â  Â  Privileged access levels should NOT be enabled for end-user visibility for an interface. When setting up privileged access levels, the visibility boxes should be Â unchecked -- otherwise, answers published to that access level (with a public status type) are available to anyone using your site. c) If necessary, clear the Visibility check box and Save changes.     Â  Privileged Customer Cannot See Privileged Answer  Â   In cases where a customer who should see a privileged answer cannot see that answer, you must verify that the ANS_PRV_ENABLED configuration setting is enabled. Also verify that the contact or organization is set with the correct SLA and that the order of the access levels is listed correctly: Step 1: Verify ANS_PRV_ENABLED Setting is Enabled: By default, the ANS_PRV_ENABLED configuration setting is turned off. It is possible to configure the other aspects of privileged access even if the setting is disabled. However, privileged contacts cannot view privileged answers if the setting is disabled.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings.   Step 2: Verify Organization or Contact SLA Association: Â  After you create custom access levels, you must assign the access levels to SLAs. When you create or edit an SLA, you can select one or more access levels for the customers assigned to the SLA. That SLA needs to be assigned to a contact or organization. To check the SLA configuration, use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select Service &gt; Service Level Agreements &gt; Service Level Agreements. Select the SLA you wish to edit. In the Access section, verify that the access level used for privileged access is checked. If necessary, enable applicable access level(s) and click Save and Close. Next, open the contact or organization and ensure the SLA you verified is applied.  To check the configuration of the organization or contact record, use the steps below:  Open the organization or contact record for editing. Click the SLA field. In the pop-up window, verify that the SLA for allowing access is listed in the top section. If not, add the SLA to the bottom section and add an activation date and click OK. Click Save to save any modifications.  Note: If you have applied an SLA to a record and then edited the SLA afterwards, the edits to the SLA are not automatically updated for the organization or contact record. That is, in order for your edits to the SLA to take affect, you must edit the organization or contact to delete the SLA instance and then re-apply the SLA instance.  Step 3: Evaluate Order of Access Levels: Â  The order of the access levels determines which of the sibling answers displays to the customer. The ""highest"" level of priority, i.e. ""Platinum"" or ""Gold"" should be listed first in the access levels table with the Everyone and Help access levels listed at the bottom of the list. For example, if your additional access levels are Platinum, Gold, and Silver, the order of the access levels should be: 1 - Platinum 2 - Gold 3 - Silver 4 - Everyone 5 - Help If the Everyone access level is listed at the top of the list, then the answer that is assigned to the Everyone access level will display for all customers, regardless of which access level the customer is assigned access to. To check the order of your access levels, go to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Customizable Menus &gt; System Menus &gt; Answer Access Levels. Â  Use the up/down arrows to move each access level into the correct order.  Step 4: Determine if an Answer with Higher Access Exists: If the company record allows access to multiple access levels, within a group of sibling answers, the answer assigned to the access level that is highest in the list is what displays to the customer. For example, let's say you have a privileged access level for Integration and another for Installation with the Integration access level listed above the Installation access level in the table. If the company record allows access to both levels, only one answer from a group of siblings will display to the customer. In this case, the answer associated with Integration displays to the end-user, even if there is a sibling answer for Installation. You can determine which answers are siblings from the Relationships tab. If siblings exist for the answer, they are listed in the Siblings Answers section on that tab. Review each sibling to determine which answer has the highest access level that the end-user has access to. That is the answer that will be visible to the end-user. If the Sibling Answers section does not display on the Relationships tab, edit the workspace and set the SiblingsVisible property for the Relationships item to be TRUE. Â  See Answer ID 2163: Accessing sibling answers Â for more information.   "

Subscribe people to receive reports;Answer ID 1796;How do I subscribe staff members to receive reports on a regular basis?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Scheduled Reports Oracle B2C Service;"  Scheduled reports can be configured separately for each report. The scheduled report is sent as either a file attachment of an email or the data and charts are included directly in the email. The report is sent to the subscribers you specify and at the dates, times, and frequency you indicate. The data included in the file is static and reflects the data and statistics from the database at the time the scheduled report was sent. That is, if the report is sent at 6:00 a.m. and the user opens the report at 2:00 p.m., the data in the subscription reflects the status of the data at 6:00 a.m. This ensures that all recipients of the scheduled report view the same data from the same time frame. When you set up a new scheduled report, the subscriber does not need to have a staff account in the Accounts table. When configuring the scheduled report, you can simply add the person's email address using the To: field. This saves their email address in the system and if you want to subscribe them to any other reports, you will be able to select their address from the select names window for future scheduled reports. Reports can be sent as one of the attachment types below:  HTML Attachment or Email Excel attachment (charts and images unavailable) CSV Comma Delimited attachment (charts and images unavailable) XML attachment (charts and images unavailable) Image attachment Image Attachment PDF Attachment Compressed CSV File    For additional information, refer to the 'Scheduling Reports' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Specify the recurrence and execution schedule, including the months, days of the week, days of the month, and hours when the report should be sent. To deselect every hour, right click in the hour field and select Deselect All. After specifying the Recurrence Pattern and Range of Recurrence, click OK. Set the filter values for your run-time filters. The scheduled report defaults to the default values of the run-time filters, but you can over-ride the defaults by clicking the Use defaults link next to Filter Values. Click OK to save the scheduled report. Note: If you schedule a report to be sent on a specific date of the month, the report will be sent only on that day. For example, if you schedule a report to run on the 31st day of the month, the report will only be sent for months that have 31 days, and will be sent on the 31st. For this case, it is better to schedule the report to run on the 1st of each month and to specify a run-time filter to capture the date range for the previous month.  To subscribe a staff member to receive reports on a regular basis, use the steps below:  From the Analytics Console, in the left-hand frame, right click on the report name and select Edit. In the right-hand frame, click the Scheduling tab. Click the Add Item icon -- . Enter a Schedule Name. Select the Format of the report.

Click Send To and add appropriate staff members, groups, distribution lists, and individuals to the Current Recipients box on the right. Click OK. Add the Subject line of the email to be sent and a Comment. The Comment field allows you to add brief content to the report subscription. Click Save.  Note: It is not possible to drill down into an incident from a report subscription. When the report subscription is sent, the email will include the name of the scheduled report (as listed in the Scheduled Name field). The email does not automatically include the name of the report from which the scheduled report is sent. Therefore, we recommend that you include the actual report name in either the Schedule Name field or in the Subject or Comment fields so that you can more easily determine which report is generating the email. If you schedule a report to be sent on a specific date of the month, the report will be sent only on that day. For example, if you schedule a report to run on the 31st day of the month, the report will only be sent for months that have 31 days, and will be sent on the 31st. For this case, it is better to schedule the report to run on the 1st of each month and to specify a run-time filter to capture the date range for the previous month.

Staff notifications and email sent to staff;Answer ID 1835;What are notifications and how do they relate to email sent to staff members?;['Answer ID 1853', 'Answer ID 5939', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 5380'];   Staff Notifications and E-mails Oracle B2C Service;"  There is a significant difference between Administration Notifications and Administration Emails. Several different types of notifications can be enabled or disabled for use as addressed in the Enabling Email Messages and Notifications section below.   Notifications within the Oracle B2C Service Console  Notifications are sent to staff members within the Oracle B2C Service administrative console and are not automatically sent to staff via email.  See instructions below for ""Enabling Email Messages and Notifications""   Notifications are Â accessed from the Communication Center Â by Â opening the Notifications item. In addition, Â Personal Settings &gt; Display Toast Notifications box is enabled for the staff member, new notifications pop up briefly and display in the lower right section of the screen. Â     Notifications are sent if the person who performs the action is different from the person who receives the notification. That is, if a staff member A assigns an incident to staff member B, then staff member A will not receive the incident reassigned notification. However, if staff member C assigns an incident from staff A to staff B, then staff member A will receive the reassigned notification and staff member B will receive the incident assigned notification. For notifications regarding records, such as Â incidents and answers, you can double click on the notification and open the record. If the staff profile allows the record to be edited, it will open in edit mode. System error notifications cannot be opened by double-clicking. Instead, to view the system errors, use the Error Log, which is accessed from the Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Logs and then click the Error Log button on the ribbon. For more information on the Error Log, refer to Answer ID 1853: Error Log and System Error notifications.  Notifying Staff by Email  Staff accounts can be configured to receive different types of email notifications and at different frequencies. Administrators can set options when editing the staff account.  Staff can enable or disable notifications Â via Â Preferences &gt; Personal Settings  Generic email to notify logged out staff: If a staff member is not logged in and the staff account has a valid email address configured, when a notification is sent to the staff member, a generic email is also sent to the staff member's email address. This email is sent if the Send Email Notification option in the staff account's Personal Settings is enabled. The purpose of this email is Â to inform the staff member Â that there is a Â notification in the Oracle B2C Service application Â and to provide instructions to log in to the application to view the notification and take appropriate actions regarding the record. The email does not contain detailed information regarding the type of notification or the associated record. The staff member will receive this email for only the first notification that they receive while logged out. Â  Send Email checkbox: If Â the Send Email checkbox is enabled for a staff member, when the staff member is logged out, they Â will receive an email version of the first notification they receive while logged out. The staff member receives a detailed email that includes the type of notification as well as details regarding the record associated with the action, such as a specific incident. This email allows the staff member to determine the nature of the notification assigned to them. The email is sent only for the first notification that occurs while the staff member is logged out. Notify Always checkbox: Â You can also enable the Notify Always check box in the staff account. With the Notify Always feature, an email is sent for every event that triggers a notification, not just the first one. The email is sent for each notification received even if the staff member is logged in. The Notify Always box is grayed out unless you have also selected Send Email.   For additional information regarding email options available when creating/editing a staff account, please see Answer ID 5939: Account Notification Email Options More information about this dialog can be found in the 'Personal Settings' section in Â online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Enabling Email Messages and Notifications  Messages and notifications can be enabled or disabled under Site Configuration options. Â  Message templates are used to easily customize your notifications and emails. Â  - From the Configuration menu, select Site Configuration &gt; Message Templates. In the left frame, double click on the interface name. - From the ribbon, notifications are listed on the Administration Notifications button. These are the notifications that display in the Communication Center. In addition, there is a separate list of messages that are always sent to staff via email. Â  These messages are listed on the Administration Emails button Â and include messages such as the Admin Forward Incident message (which is sent when a staff member clicks Forward for an incident) and the Email Incident Information message (which is sent as a result of an Email Incident action in a business rule). For more information on enabling and disabling messages and notifications within Oracle B2C Service, refer to Â Answer 5380: Customizing notifications and email messages sent by Oracle B2C Service.  Notifications between different interfaces The following example Â describes a situation where notifications are sent on a site with various interfaces: Â  Agent A is logged into interface 1 and working with an incident associated to interface 2. Â  Â Agent A Â then assigns that incident to Agent B. Â  The Assignment notification that Agent B receives will be Â from the default mailbox of interface 1, because that is the Â interface the action took place in. This behavior may Â affect sites Â where interfaces are set up for different languages. Â  If an agent logged into a Spanish interface re-assigns an incident associated to an English interface, the notification received will be in Spanish."

Setting up service level agreements (SLAs);Answer ID 1837;What is an SLA and how do I set one up?;['Answer ID 1944', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Customer Portal, Service Level Agreements;"  Service Level Agreements (SLAs) allow flexibility in the amount of support provided to your customers. When you create an SLA, you can define the duration of the service agreement or the number of incidents that can be submitted by the contact or organization. In addition, granting privileged access to contacts or organizations is accomplished with an SLA. The bottom section of the SLA allows you to define which access levels the contact or organization can view. When an SLA is actually issued to a contact or organization, the specific item associated with the contact or organization record is called an SLA Instance. Therefore, several SLA instances can be generated from the same SLA that is defined in the Service Level Agreements table. For more information on applying SLA instances to contacts and organizations, refer to Answer ID 1944: Applying SLAs to Contacts or Organizations. Note: Â The SLA field can be removed from specific workspaces or set to a read-only mode to prevent staff groups from accessing and editing the SLA field.  Additional Considerations: When working with SLAs, once you apply the SLA to a contact or organization, it is a best practice to not edit that SLA in the future. When an SLA is edited in the Service Level Agreements table, it is not automatically re-applied to the contact and organization records. As a result, changes made to the SLA are not automatically carried forward to your contacts and organizations. Instead, you must remove the older SLA instance and save the record. Then, you can apply the updated SLA to the record. When an SLA has been applied to a contact or organization, you can set incidents for that contact to be counted towards a specific SLA. When you open the incident, you can set the SLA field in the sidebar so that the incident counts towards the number of incidents allowed by that SLA. If the contact or organization record does not have an SLA applied to it, the SLA field is not accessible when editing or responding to incidents that are associated with that contact or organization.  Â   Configuring an SLA  To add a Service Level Agreement, use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select Service &gt; Â Service Level Agreements &gt; Service Level Agreements. Â    On the ribbon, click the ""New"" button to add a new Service Level Agreement.   Complete the fields per the table below and click Add.  The fields to define when creating an SLA are:        Service Level Name: The name of the SLA as it appears on the interface Â            Active: Enable or disable the SLA for activation. When enabled, the SLA can be applied to contacts or organizations manually or via rules.           Chat Incidents: Define the maximum number of incidents that can be submitted from a chat session. To allow unlimited incidents for the sources listed, leave the source field blank.           CSR Incidents: Define the maximum number of incidents that can be created by an agent Â from the administration pages. To allow unlimited incidents for the sources listed, leave the source field blank.           Email Incidents: Define the maximum number of incidents that can be submitted via an email sent to a service mailbox. To allow unlimited incidents for the sources listed, leave the source field blank.           Self-Service Incidents: Define the maximum number of incidents that can be submitted from the Ask a Question page. To allow unlimited incidents for the sources listed, leave the source field blank.           Total Incidents: Enter the total number of allowed incidents. The Total Incidents field must be greater than or equal to any other incident field.    Note: If any of the incident source fields are blank, the Total Incidents field must also be blank.           Term (Duration): If the SLA is time-based, enter the Â number of days, weeks, months or years. If Length is left blank, the SLA is for an unlimited length of time. If non-blank, the start date is the date that the SLA instance is issued.           Self-Service: If enabled, contacts or organizations can access the public knowledgebase (the Answers tab).           Access: If using privileged access, highlight the access level(s) to be granted by the SLA.           Response Requirements: You can specify response requirements, work hours, and holidays that are specific to the SLA. The response requirements of the SLA override the default response requirements. This allows you to define more stringent response requirements based on the level of service being provided by the SLA.    Click the interface name to configure response requirements, work hours, and holidays to be used for incidents submitted through that interface. If you do not set up response requirements, the default response requirements will be used.    Select the day and work hours along with the Response and Resolution times (in minutes) to be associated with the SLA. Then multi-select from the list of Holidays (you have already created) and click Update.     Â   Restrictions to End-User Features  For Customer Portal enabled pages:  Open the ask.php file in the /views/pages folder.   Locate the following line of code at the top of the file.  &lt;rn:meta title=""#rn:msg:ASK_QUESTION_HDG#"" template=""standard.php"" clickstream=""incident_create""/&gt; Edit the code to change the login_required page meta tag to ""true"" and add the sla_required_type and sla_failed_page meta tags.  &lt;rn:meta title=""#rn:msg:ASK_QUESTION_HDG#"" template=""standard.php"" login_required=""true"" clickstream=""incident_create"" sla_required_type=""incident"" sla_failed_page=""/app/error/error_id/2"" /&gt; Save ask.php.

Setting up privileged access;Answer ID 1838;How do I set up privileged access?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 208', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 5894'];   Privileged Access, Access Levels, Service Level Agreements;"  Privileged access allows you to give certain customers access to information that is not available to all customers. Â For Â example, you may want to give customers who Â have purchased a premium support contract access to a greater level of information. Â  The privileged access functionality is integrated with the My Â Account tab. The end-user's contact record or organization must have a service level agreement applied that allows access to privileged access. Then, when an end-user logs in to the end-user pages, the privileged answers are included in the list of all answers available to the end-user. There is no separate link to view only the privileged answers. Important Note: When adding access levels to be used with privileged access, the order of the access levels in the Access Levels table determines which answer is viewable to a customer. When different privileged answers are contained within the same meta-answer, only one answer is displayed to the end-user. The answer that is displayed is the one associated with the highest access level that the customer has been granted access to view. When using privileged access, the list of products and categories in the menus is the same for all users -- on both the Answers page and the Ask a Question page. It is not possible to display certain products or categories so that they are accessed only by the privileged users. If you need to restrict access for some users to additional products or categories, you should consider implementing a separate interface for your privileged users.   Step 1: Enable the Privileged Access Feature  To enable privileged access: 1. In the Configuration settings editor, Â locate ANS_PRV_ENABLED  Â under RightNow User Interface &gt; End-User Interface &gt; Answers. 2. Click the drop-down menu in the Value field and select Yes. 3. Click the Save button on the ribbon. For more information on accessing the Configuration Settings editor, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings.  Step 2: Add Â Privileged Answer Access Levels  There are two default answer access levels, Help and Everyone. These two default Answer Access Levels are not visible for Server Level Agreements since they have been created for specific purposes. Â In order to use privileged access, you must first add custom access levels that let your customers view only certain groups of answers. If you assign an answer access level that has visibility on an interface, all customers on that interface can view the answer. If you assign an answer to an access level that does not have visibility on an interface, you can still offer access to certain customers by assigning them an SLA that allows privileged access. You can also tag parts of an answer with different access levels by creating conditional sections within an answer. Customers who are assigned an SLA with a privileged access level can view the conditional sections assigned to that level. Leave the Everyone access level to be visible to end-users so that you can publish answers for your entire user base. Even if you choose to not publish answers for your general audience, at least one access level must have the End-User visibility checkbox enabled. To add a customer answer access level:  Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. Double-click Customizable Â Menus under Application Appearance. Expand the System Menus folder by clicking the arrow to the left of the folder. Click Answer Access Levels to display the editor. Click the New button on the ribbon. Type the name of the answer access level in the Â Label field. Leave the end-user visibility check box option disabled for all of the interface(s) listed. See Answer ID 208: Specifying answer access levels to display on the end-user pages Â for more information. Â  Use the drag-and-drop feature to order of the access levels so that the most restrictive or ""highest"" level of priority is at the top of the list. The Everyone access level and any other access levels set to end-user visibility should be listed beneath the access levels used for privileged access. Click the Save and Close button on the ribbon to save the answer access level and close the editor.  Â   Step 3: Assign Answers to the Access Level  You can add answers and assign them to the custom access levels or add conditional sections to answers and assign them to the access levels you created. Â  You must also set the answer status to Public or a status that is a public status type.  Â   Step 4: Create a Service Level Agreement that Grants Access to the Privileged Access Level  You must create a service level agreement (SLA) in order to grant privileged access to your contacts and organizations. The SLA is applied to appropriate contact or organization records to grant privileged access:  Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. From Service, select Service Level Agreements &gt; Service Level Agreements. Â    Click the New button on the ribbon to add a Service Level Agreement or Â to edit, click an existing Service Level Agreement.   Enter the field information and check the Active box. Â    In the Access Â field, Â check the appropriate access level to be granted with this SLA. Use. Â    Click the Save and Close button on the ribbon. Â    Add more SLAs for each access level as appropriate.  Â   Step 5: Apply the SLA to the Organization or Contact  The last step is assigning SLAs to your customers. With the SLA created, you can apply an SLA instance to an organization or to an individual contact that is not associated with an organization. SLAs applied to an organization allow privileged access to all contacts associated with that organization. Note: You can only apply SLA instances if your staff profile has the Edit SLA Instances option enabled on the Service options. Â   Search for the organization or contact and open the record for editing. Â    Click Edit link on the SLA field. Â    Click Add SLA Instance and select the SLA and active date in the pop-up window.   Click OK again to close the SLA Viewer. Â    Click Save and Close.  Â  To verify that the privileged access you set for your end-user works properly, log in as that contact and verify that the additional answers are included on the Answers page.

Types of table joins used with reports;Answer ID 1839;;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics Oracle B2C Service,Ã‚Â All versions;  Table joins allow you to link data from two or more database tables into a single query result. This allows you to view and display data from multiple tables in a single report. When you create a report that uses data from multiple tables, you can specify which type of join to use between the tables. To successfully join information from two tables, each table must contain a data field that is common to both tables. The fields do not need to have the same name within each table, but MUST refer to a common element in both tables.  Determining Join Types Between Tables  When tables are joined in a report, the icon used illustrates the join type. If the circle on the left is entirely filled in as blue, there is an outer join between the tables. If only the overlapping section of the icon is blue, the join between the tables is an inner join. To determine how tables are joined in a report, use the steps below:  From the Reports Explorer, open the report for editing. Or if the report is listed in your navigation items, right click on the report and select Edit Report Definition.  Â  Â  Â  Select Tables from the ribbon.  Â Click the indented table listed and review the Join Type.   To change the join type, click the Outer or Inner radio button and click OK. Then, save the report.    Simplified Examples  For example, in the Oracle B2C Service database, the incidents table includes the assigned field which specifies which staff member the incident is assigned to by the account ID. The accounts table lists all staff accounts and includes the acct_id field. Since the incidents.assigned field and the accounts.acct_id field both refer to the same information (a staff account ID), the incidents and accounts tables can be joined together. As a result, joining these tables allows you to run reports or use views that include data from both tables, such as the number of incidents assigned to each staff member. The simplified incidents and accounts tables listed below will be used to better illustrate the differences between inner and outer joins.  The simplified incidents and accounts tables listed below will be used to better illustrate the differences between inner and outer joins.     Ref_no  Incident Status  Incident Assigned  Accounts Acct_ID  Accounts Display Name     001  Unresolved  32  4  Jim     002  Solved  15  9  Paula       003  Unresolved  15  15  Brenda     004  Unresolved  (null)  27  Tom     005  Updated  27  32  Ken    The specific data that is included in the query result depends on whether an inner or outer join is used in the query. If you select Toggle Join Type when working with the table instances in a view or report, the type of join will change from an inner join to an outer join or from an outer join to an inner join. To change the type of join between the tables, right click on the lower of the two tables and select Toggle Join Type. The icon of overlapping circle indicates which type of join is used between the tables. If only the intersection of the circles is shaded, the join is an inner join. If the entire left circle is shaded, the join is an outer join. To see more specific information about how the tables are joined, right click on the table name and select Node Info.  Inner Joins  An inner join returns data from the query ONLY if the value in the field in the first table also appears as a value in the field of the second table. This means that data must exist in both fields in both tables in order for the data to be returned in the query. With inner joins, the ordering of the tables has no effect on the resulting data set.  Example: Using the case of the incidents and accounts tables, if the inner join is used, the query result will include ONLY the incidents that are assigned to a staff member. Incidents that are unassigned do not have a value in the accounts table, which means those incidents are not included in the result set. Similarly, staff members that do not have incidents assigned to them will not appear in the query results since they do not have incidents.  If the two simplified tables above are joined using an inner join, the resulting dataset is:     Ref_no  Status  Assigned/  Acct_ID  Display Name       001  Unresolved  32  Ken     002  Solved  15  Brenda     003  Unresolved  15  Brenda     005  Updated  27  Tom    Note: With the inner join, incident 004 does not appear in the query results (because it is not assigned to a staff member) and Jim and Paula are not listed in the dataset because they do not have incidents assigned to them.  Outer Joins  An outer join is also referred to as a left join. With an outer join, the query results include all of the data from the first table, and where the data exists in the second table, data from the second table is included as well for each record. With an outer join, it is possible that the row of data returned includes only the information from the first (or left) table. Null values can exist for the fields associated with the second table. When working with outer joins, the ordering of the tables is very important. The resulting dataset is quite dependent on which table is listed first for the join.  Example: Using the simplified incidents and accounts tables, an outer join with the incidents table as the first table...  ...the resulting dataset is:     Ref_no  Status  Assigned/  Acct_ID  Display Name       001  Unresolved  32  Ken     002  Solved  15  Brenda     003  Unresolved  15  Brenda     004  Unresolved  (null)  (null)     005  Updated  27  Tom    Note: With this outer join, incident 004 is included in the results. Paula and Jim do not appear in the results since they cannot be associated with any of the incidents.  Example: Using the simplified incidents and accounts tables, with the accounts table as the first table...  ... the resulting dataset would be:     Display Name  Acct_ID/  Assigned  Ref_no  Status       Jim  4  (null)  (null)     Paula  9  (null)  (null)     Brenda  15  002  Solved     Brenda  15  003  Unresolved     Tom  27  005  Updated     Ken  32  001  Unresolved    Note: With this outer join, Jim and Paula ARE listed in the dataset, even though they do not have incidents assigned to them. Incident 004 is not included in the results because it cannot be associated with a staff member.

Creating and using incident queues;Answer ID 1840;What are queues and how do I set one up?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Incident Queues, Customizable Menus;"  Incident queues are basically groups of incidents from which agents can pull incidents to work on. Incoming incidents can be assigned to queues by workflow rules. Incidents can be assigned to a queue, and then, based on the staff member's profile, a staff member can pull incidents from the queues they are allowed access to. You can also configure the queue to assign incidents in a round-robin fashion to all staff members whose profile includes the queue. Â  Incidents however, cannot be created from the report. Administrators can configure queues from any interface. Â  Staff profiles specify which queues staff members can pull incidents from. Â  Profiles also include Â the pull policy, pull quantity, and inbox limit. Only incidents that are not assigned to a specific staff member and have an unresolved status type can be pulled from a queue.  You can make the Queue field required by editing the incident workspace. Open the workspace for editing, click the Queue field, and set the Required property to On New And Edit. You can define one of your queues to be the default, so that incidents created by staff members from the administration console are automatically assigned to that queue unless otherwise routed by a rule. To set the default queue, open the queue for editing and check the Default check box. Note: Incidents submitted via the Ask a Question page or via email are not automatically assigned to the default queue. You must set up a catch-all rule to set the queue for incidents submitted via Ask a Question or email.  Â  Typically, when setting up incident queues, you Â need to do the following:  Set up the incident queue. Set up a rule to assign incoming incidents to a queue. Create a staff profile that allows access to the queue. Assign staff members to the profile.  Specific instructions for each of these actions are provided below.  Â   Set up the Incident Queue  Use the steps below to set up the incident queue. When you add a queue, additional fields are enabled on the Service tab when editing a staff profile. The field added to the Service tab include the Pull Policy, Pull Limit, Inbox Limit, and Statistics. Steps:  Click the Configuration button Â on the navigation pane. Double-click Customizable Menus under Application Appearance. The Customizable Menus tree displays on the content pane. Click the arrow next to the System Menus folder to expand the list. Click Incident Queues to display the editor To add an incident queue, click the New button on the ribbon. Or to edit an incident queue, click it in the tree. Type a name for a new incident queue or edit an existing on in the Label field. Â     Then:  Click the Queue Type drop-down menu and select one of the following options"" Standard, Round Robin (All), or Round Robin (Logged In). Choose the Round Robin Â if you want incidents from the queue to be automatically assigned to the staff members who can pull from the queue. Incidents are assigned in a round-robin fashion (rotating among all staff members who can pull from the queue. This effectively ""pushes"" incidents to staff members.  Note: The round-robin feature assigns incidents to all staff members whose profiles list the queue, including staff members who are not logged in. Â  This can be changed in November '09 and newer releases, which include a checkbox Â labeled ""only for logged in staff members"".   If you want this incident queue to be the default queue, select the Default checkbox.   Click the Save and Close button on the ribbon to save the incident queue and close the editor.   Define a Rule to Assign Incidents to the Incident Queue  To have incoming incidents assigned automatically to a queue, you must add or modify an existing rule to include an action that assigns incidents to the incident queue:  From the Configuration items, select Site Configuration &gt; Â Rules. Click the Incidents button on the ribbon and make sure you are in Â Edit mode by clicking the Edit button on the ribbon. Â    If necessary, define a ""Created"" state and set as the Initial state. In the left-hand frame, right click on States and enter the State Name, Notes, and check Initial state. Click Save.   In the left-hand frame, right click on your created state and select New Rule.   Add rule conditions as necessary to the IF part of the rule, for example, based on the incident source, product, or category.   In the THEN part of the rule, click Add Action - Then Â &gt; Set Field &gt; Queue ID and select the Incident Queue from the drop-down menu.   Add additional actions as necessary. These may include actions that change the state of the incident or stops processing the remaining rules in the list.   Click Save.   Click Compile to set up your new ruleset.   Click Activate if you want to apply the new ruleset to your incidents. You may be asked to assign incidents to a state, if their current state is null.  Â   Configure Staff Profile to Access the Incident Queue  Modify the appropriate staff profile to allow staff to pull incidents from the incident queue you created:  Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. Â    Double-click Profiles under Staff Management and then double-click the profile you want to edit. The profile editor opens. Or, if adding a new profile, click the New button on the ribbon.   Click the Permissions button on the ribbon. Click the Service tab. Â    Incident permissions need to be set before you can assign Incident Queues. In Incident Â Queues section, click the drop-down menu of queue names. Select the appropriate queue.   Define the pull policy (manual, strict priority, or first due), the pull quantity (how many will be brought in to the staff member's inbox with each pull), and the inbox limit. The inbox limit is the maximum number of incidents with an unresolved status type that can be assigned to a staff member using that profile.  For example, if the Inbox Limit is 30, a staff member can only have 30 incidents with an unresolved status type assigned to them. At that point, the staff member can no longer pull incidents to their Inbox.  Â  Â  Â  Click Save.  Â   Assign Staff Member to Appropriate Profile  Modify the appropriate staff profile to allow staff to pull incidents from the incident queue you created:  From the Configuration items, select Staff Management &gt; Staff Accounts by Group.   Double-click on the account name or right-click and select Open. Â    Set the Profile menu to the appropriate profile configured for the incident queue.   Click Update.

Overview of business rule functionality;Answer ID 1842;How do business rules work in our Oracle B2C Service application?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Business Rules;"  The rules feature is quite powerful in allowing you to define conditions and actions to take on records within your Oracle B2C Service application. You can set up rules to route new, incoming incidents as well as escalate existing records. Business rules can act on most of the record types within the Oracle B2C Service database, including incidents, answers, contacts, organizations, chat sessions, and sales opportunities. In addition, rules can be applied to both new and existing records. The basic format of an individual rule includes an IF section that defines the criteria that a record must meet and a THEN section that defines which actions are executed for that record. Conditions in the IF section of the rule are based on how certain fields are set for the record, such as ""IF the incident.status equals Unresolved"" or ""IF the incident.source equals Ask a Question or Email"". The THEN part of the rule often includes actions that sets fields for the record or assigns the record to a group or individual or sends a notification to a group or individual. A Â rule can also include an ELSE clause that allows you to define how to act on the record if the IF conditions are not met. This allows you to construct conditions and actions that support the phrase: IF these conditions are met, THEN do these actions on the record ELSE (otherwise) do these actions on the record.  This answer is intended to provide an overview of the rules functionality. For comprehensive information regarding rules, refer to the Business Rules Management Â section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Types of Rules  Several Â rule types (listed below) are available to automate your business processes and ensure that records are handled consistently. Rulesets are created separately for the different types of records in your application. For example, you can create a ruleset for routing and escalating incidents. You can also create a ruleset for routing and escalating opportunities.        Incident Rules are triggered when incidents are created or updated. You can use incident rules to notify staff when incidents are received from certain accounts, if you wish to automate an escalation, or to present end-users with SmartAssistant suggested solutions. Â            Answer Rules are triggered when answers in the Answer Console are created or updated. You can use answer rules to notify your knowledge engineer when a new answer has been proposed or to notify your legal team when a finished answer is ready for their review. Â            Contact Rules are triggered when contact records are created or updated. For example, you can use contact rules to automatically apply service level agreements (SLAs) or to set fields based on how the record is created or updated. Â            Organization Rules are triggered when organization records are created or updated. For example, you can use Organization Rules to notify support staff or accounts receivable when an organization record is created or updated.           Task Rules are triggered when a task is created or updated. Task rules can be used to notify staff members when a task is overdue. Â            Opportunity Rules are triggered when a sales opportunity is created or updated. You can use opportunity rules to notify managers when a sales opportunity reaches a certain status in your sales cycle. Â            Chat Rules are triggered when a new request for a chat session is received. For example, you can use chat session rules to route chat requests to a particular agent queue and to escalate the request to another queue if it is not answered in a specific amount of time. Â            Offer Advisor Â Rules are triggered when contacts Â match the defined Â target rule.  Â         You can configure a set of rules for each of these types of records, which is called a rulebase . Each rulebase works independently of the others since each rulebase applies to a specific type of record. That is, contact rules only apply to contact records and incident rules only apply to incident records. Each time a record is created or updated, it is compared to the rulebase for that record type. If the record matches the IF conditions for the rule, the action is executed.  Â   Edit and View Modes  Business rules are accessed from the Configuration &gt; Â Site Configuration area and then selecting Rules. Note that when selecting a rule type, you are given the option to view the active ruleset (View Active) or to Edit the rules. When you select View Active, you are taken to a read-only screen where you can review all currently configured rules that are working in your site for the record type that you select. When you edit rules, you are actually working in a copy of the rulebase that you can choose to activate or abandon, depending on your modifications. Therefore, when you are in the edit mode of your rules, you can make changes to the copy of your rulebase, but those changes do not go into effect until you activate that copy of the rulebase. When working with a rulebase, the left-hand panel displays all states, rules, and functions configured in the rules module.  Â   Rule States  When configuring rules, you must define rule states for your records. A rule state represents a certain time or condition in the lifespan of a record, for example, at a high level answers might have a creation state, review state, and publish state. Each state contains a set of rules that are applied when a record reaches that state. For example, a creation state includes the rules that are to be applied when a record is first created. The record is matched to the rules for the created/initial state and the appropriate actions are enacted. Actions that can be taken include transitioning the record to a different state, where it will begin matching a new set of rules, immediately or on the next update. In general, each type of rulebase should have at least two states -- one for when the record is created (an initial rule state) and the other for existing records. Rules are generally set up so that when a record is created, it will be compared to the rules in the initial/created rule state and then a rule in that state will transition the record to an existing rule state. With this approach, new records are evaluated and routed and then become an ""existing"" record. Within the existing rule state, there are frequently other rules that allow for escalations and notifications associated with updating the existing records.  Â   Functions  You may find that you need to apply the same set of rules frequently under a variety of conditions within your overall ruleset. Functions allow you to define a set of rules and actions that are to be executed when invoked by a single rule. That is, from within a rule, you can call a function and that function consists of a set of rules. You can also call a function from a rule that is in a function. Functions make it easier to manage sets of actions that are used in several different rules, by allowing you to define them only once and then invoke the function from separate rules. Once you create a function, it will be available as an action in your rules. Sets of escalation rules are frequently included in an escalation function.  Â   Enabling Your Rules: Compile and Activate Options  When you choose the Edit option for a type of rulebase, if a copy of the rulebase doesn't exist, then a copy will be created when you first click Edit. If a copy of the rulebase already exists (because you have already been in Edit mode and did not activate or abandon the edited rules), when you click Edit, you will be taken to the existing copy. Either way, when you are in Edit mode, you are not actually editing the active, live set of rules. To commit the changes you have made while in Edit mode, you must compile and activate the edited rulebase. Note: While in Edit mode, you can tell when the copy of the rulebase was created and by whom by viewing the lower section of the right frame. The top part of the right frame includes a chart that illustrates relationships between current rule states and functions. In the left frame, you can right click to add states, rules, or functions and the main panel displays a configuration screen where you specify the appropriate parameters for your rules. The Compile button causes the Oracle B2C Service application to verify the integrity of your current rules, that is, to ensure that there are no missing operators or values and that your rules can be executed as configured. Use the compile option when you want to check your progress during an overall edit session. The Activate button both compiles and activates the new rulebase that you have been editing. This action verifies the integrity of your rules and makes your changes go into effect immediately. This action causes the application to replace your active rules with your newly compiled rulebase."

Routing incidents to staff members based on queues;Answer ID 1843;How do I route incidents to my staff members based on the queue(s) they have access to?;['Answer ID 1840', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Accounts, Profiles / Incident Routing / Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;"  You can configure rules to assign incidents to queues. The staff member's profile specifies which queues the staff member can pull incidents from along with the pull policy, pull quantity, and inbox limit. That is, based on the staff profile, a staff member can pull incidents from the queues Â listed on the Service tab Â in their staff profile. Using the Fill Inbox feature, only incidents that are not assigned to a specific staff member and have an unresolved status type can be pulled from a queue. When editing an incident, it is not possible to make the Queue field a required field. Round-Robin Assignment: You can configure the queue so that when incidents are assigned to the queue, the incidents are distributed using round-robin assignment to the staff members who can pull from the queue. That is, incidents can be pushed, using round-robin, to staff members. NOTE: Round Robin assignments work with Â all status types except ""waiting"" and ""unresolved"" Â  Â where the assigned value is null. Incidents are assigned via round robin to all staff whose profile can pull incidents from that queue. For example, if you have three staff profiles that include the queue, incidents will be routed to all staff who use any of those three profiles. When round-robin assignment is enabled, incidents are assigned to the staff members. Â  Â  Incidents are not assigned to staff accounts that are disabled or locked in the Staff Accounts table. The round-robin assignment does not load balance the number of incidents assigned to each staff member. It does not assign more incidents to staff members who have fewer incidents assigned to them when there is capacity for the agents. For example, if the total limit is 20 incidents per agent and an agent has 10 incidents, another agent has 15, and the last agent has 19 unresolved incidents, the remaining unassigned 5 incidents will get distributed evenly until the total limit is reached. In this example, the first agent will get 2 incidents for total of 12, the second agent will get 2 for total of 17, and the last agent will get 1 more incident for total of 20.  Default Queue: You can define one of your queues to be the default queue for incidents created from the administrative pages. That way, incidents created by your staff members can be automatically assigned to that default queue unless otherwise routed by a rule. To set the default queue, open the queue for editing and check the Default check box. Therefore, if you want incidents routed via round robin to a specific work group, create a rule to assign the incidents to a specific queue. Then, if the staff members all use the same profile, make sure that profile is the only one that has the queue listed in the Queue box on the Service tab. If your staff members have several different profiles, make sure that all of the profiles have the queue listed on the Service tab and make sure that no other profiles include that queue. Typically, to set up your Oracle B2C Service application so that staff can pull from a queue, you must:  Set up the incident queue. Set up a rule to assign incoming incidents to a queue. Create a profile that allows access to the queue. Assign staff members to the profile.  If the incident gets assigned to a group which uses a different queue, the queue must be unset so the round robin push methodology does not reassign the incident to the next available agent of the prior group. Â For example, you have Ã¢â‚¬Å“2nd LevelÃ¢â‚¬Â group and a Ã¢â‚¬Å“1st level groupÃ¢â‚¬Â. The assigned field of the incident is moved from Ã¢â‚¬Å“1st levelÃ¢â‚¬Â to Ã¢â‚¬Å“2nd levelÃ¢â‚¬Â. However the incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s queue does not change. So, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to also change the queue to coincide with a queue used by 2nd Level. Â This can be done through workspace rules or business rules. For more information and specific steps for each of the actions listed above, refer to Answer ID 1840: Creating and Using Incident Queues. Â  See also, the 'How to Route Incidents to Queues' section in online documentation. For more incident routing options, refer to the 'Rules for Routing Customer Support Questions' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Setting a specific format or mask for custom text fields;Answer ID 1847;When setting up a custom text field, can I require a specific format for completing the field?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Format Input Masks for Custom Fields, Phone and Postal Codes;"  You can define a mask to be used with custom text fields, country phone and country mail. When a mask is defined for a field, entries to that field must match the pre-defined formatting. For example, you can use a mask to specify the format used with telephone numbers or postal codes. Within Oracle B2C Service, masks can be used when configuring any custom field that has a data type equal to a text field. When you hover over the Mask field, a pop-up displays that provides information about creating a mask. You can Â define a mask in the custom text field for a specific number of characters, but you cannot define a minimum number of characters. Masks are enforced on both the end-user pages and the administrative pages. Masks are not available on data imports. Note: Masks are also used with the Countries/Provinces table. For each country defined in the list, you can specify a phone mask to define a format for telephone numbers used in that country and a postal mask to define the required format for postal codes.  When configuring a mask: you must use two characters to define an individual character within the field. The first character defines if the character is a fixed value (i.e. a dash or period within the string) or whether a specific case must be used (i.e. upper or lower case). The second character defines the type of character allowed, alpha, numeric, either, or any type of character. The first character used to format a character is either F, U, L, or M:        F is used for fixed, formatted characters such as a dash or period       U is used to designate an upper case value        L is used to designate a lower case value        M is used to allow either upper or lower case (such as numbers)     Â  The second character when defining the format of a character is either #, A, L, or C:        # indicates that a numerical value is required Â  Â        A indicates that either a number or letter is required Â  Â        L indicates that an alphabetic (letter) character is required Â  Â        C indicates that any typed character is acceptable, including numbers, letters, symbols or spaces     Â   Telephone Number Example: Masks are commonly used to define a format to be used with telephone numbers to ensure that the area code is included with the number: Mask: F(M#M#M#F)F M#M#M#F-M#M#M#M# Format: (###) ###-####  Note that with this mask, the first two elements of the mask, F(, define the fixed left parenthesis. The next two elements, M#, defines a mixed-case numerical value. Since numbers do not have cases, you can use M#, U#, or L# to represent a numerical value. Between the area code and the number, you can include a space which is represented by ""F "" -- that is, a capital F followed by a space which represents the fixed character as a space. Note: If you wish to include phone extensions, you can use a format similar to: Mask: F(M#M#M#F)F M#M#M#F-M#M#M#M#F M#M#M#M# Format: (###) ###-#### ####  However, if you include the mask for phone extensions, then you must enter an extension for each phone number entered. For numbers without an extension, you might enter a special sequence, such as 0000, to indicate that there is no extension for that number. If Â you are creating masks Â for fields in which data already exists, please check to make sure that any special characters do not interfere with the mask formatting. Â  If a particular field varies in terms of length (for example, an international Â phone number field where the number of digits varies by country) then a mask will not be effective.  For additional information, refer to the 'Input Masks' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Using Alerts when scheduling a report subscription;Answer ID 1854;What is an alert when scheduling a report subscription and when should I use one?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 2026'];Analytics, Report Alerts; Alerts are used to send scheduled reports to specified individuals or groups when certain criteria are met. For example, an alert can be used to send a report to a records administrator when a contact or organization record is saved and does not have certain fields set correctly. Â  You can also schedule an alert to be sent when the backlog of unresponded incidents exceeds a specific number. Alerts are configured Â as a scheduled report and Â can be sent to staff members, groups, distribution lists, or manually-entered email addresses. The difference is that with an alert, the report is sent only if the defined alert or alerts are met. Before defining an alert, Data Exceptions must be created in the report output. You can then create alerts to notify email recipients when the data exception has been met a certain number of times. Therefore, the high-level steps for using alerts are  Create the basic report to send. Include data exceptions in the report to use as criteria for sending the alert. Define the alert(s) to be used to determine if the scheduled report should be sent. For more information on data exceptions and alerts, refer to Â the Analytics manual. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Â   Step 1: Define the Basic Report First, set up the report to use as the basis for your scheduled report. Define the table instances, filters, and output for the report. For more information on configuring reports in Oracle B2C Service, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a basic custom report.  Step 2: Define the Data Exception Data exceptions allow you to flag certain entries in the report based on criteria you specify. For example, you can define a data exception to highlight records in the report that have been responded to by specific staff members or were created in a specific time frame. To send an alert only if any data is present in the report, you need to set the data exception so that any Â record in the report will meet the data exception. For example, if you need an alert to fire when an organization record is set up improperly, you can define filters in your report to find the records that are set incorrectly and then set a data exception to be if the org ID is greater than 0. That way, since the org ID is always greater than 0, any org that met the criteria of the report would also match the data exception. Note: When working with incident data that should trigger an alert to be sent, you can use the count function to count the number of incidents in the report and set up the data exception to be count(incidents.ref_no) is greater than 0. In a general report, you can set data exceptions so that they display using a different format than other data in the report. However, when setting an exception for purposes of triggering an alert, you may or may not want the exception to display in a unique format. For more information on configuring data exceptions, refer to Answer ID 2026: Using data exceptions to customize report records. Once you have created the data exceptions, you can either save your report or you can continue on to step 3 below to Â set up the alert and the scheduled report.  Step 3: Configure the Alert to be Sent Alerts are similar to scheduled reports in that they are sent to individuals or groups at certain times. However, alerts have additional requirements where the report is sent only if the data exception defined in the alert are met. To define the alert use the steps below: From Â the Home tab, click Scheduling. Â  Click the Add Schedule link. Type the email addresses to send the alert to, separated by semicolons. Or, Click the To button to open the Select Names window where you can add staff members, groups, and distribution lists to the alert. A report schedule needs to be created in order to add an alert. If the report should be sent as a regular scheduled report and as an alert, then you must add recipients to both the schedule's To field and the alert's To field. However, if the purpose of the schedule is only to send and alert, do not add recipients to the schedules To field. Click Add Alert to open the Add Alert window. Define a Name for the alert and specify which Exception to use and when the alert should be met -- that is, how many times the exception is met. Then, click OK and the alert displays in the table. Click OK and save your report.

Making the Answers, Ask a Question, and Chat tabs available to specific customers;Answer ID 1868;How can I makeÃ‚Â certain tabs available to specific customers?;['Answer ID 1837'];   Service Level Agreements, Customer Portal pages Oracle B2C Service  Issue   We wantÃ‚Â to enable theÃ‚Â chat help tab, butÃ‚Â want to make it available to only specific customers. Can I do that with the Answers and Ask a Question tab as well?;"  You can configure your RightNow end-user pages so that only Â certain end-users can access specific Â pages and functions. For example, you can configure your site so that only a select set of end-users can access the Ask a Question page Â to submit incidents. Similarly, you can Â restrict access to the Answers and Â Chat pages. Â  You can also restrict users from submitting incidents via email sent to a configured mailbox.  Overview of Steps: For example, if you wish to restrict access to the Ask a Question page to specific customers, Â use the steps below:  Create an SLA that allows incidents to be submitted from the Ask a Question page. That is, in the SLA, the Self-Service Incidents field should be blank (to allow for unlimited incidents) or a number greater than 0 (to allow only a specific number of incidents). For more information on creating SLAs, refer to Answer ID 1837: Setting up Service Level Agreements (SLAs).   Apply the SLA to the appropriate contact or organization. Â    Configure your end-user pages to require an SLA to access the Ask a Question page. Â  Refer to the section below.   Use a test contact record set up with the SLA to verify that you can submit an assistance request via the Ask a Question page. Then, verify that a user who does not have that SLA cannot access the Ask a Question page.  Similarly, you can allow only specific contacts or organizations to submit incidents via email or have chat session or even access the end-user pages.  Configuring the SLA: Â  When you create the SLA, specific fields in the SLA correspond to which features the end-user can access. Â  For the incident fields, you can set the value to be blank which allows unlimited incidents to be submitted or you can set the field to a value greater than 0 to allow a specific number of incidents to be submitted via that channel. The fields to define when creating an SLA are:  Chat Incidents: Type the maximum number of allowable chat incidents. Enter a zero if no incidents are allowed or leave the field blank to allow an unlimited number of incidents. CSR Incidents: Type the maximum number of allowable incidents that can be created by a staff member for the contact or organization (for example, when customers contact your organization by phone). Enter a zero if no incidents are allowed or leave the field blank to allow an unlimited number of CSR incidents. Self-Service Incidents: Type the maximum number of allowable incidents created from the Ask a Question page. Enter a zero if no incidents are allowed or leave the field blank to allow an unlimited number of incidents. Email Incidents: Type the maximum number of allowable email incidents. Enter a zero if no incidents are allowed or leave the field blank to allow an unlimited number of email incidents. Note: If the SLA_SUBMIT_EMAIL configuration setting is enabled, a valid, active SLA must exist for contacts and organizations to send emails to Service. If the EU_SLA_VISIBLE configuration setting is enabled, SLA information will be visible in email response. Self-Service: Select this check box to allow customer access to the Answers page on the customer portal. Note: If this check box is cleared, customers will not be able to view answers and may be directed to a permission denied.  Configuring Â the End-user Pages to Require an SLA: Â  In the Customer Portal pages, to require an SLA to access a page, you must include the sla_required=""true"" attribute in the meta tag for the appropriate file. For further information, refer to the online documentation for Require an SLA on the Ask a Question page. With the sla_required=""true"" attribute added to the meta tag, the contact must have a valid SLA associated to either their contact or organization record in order to access the page.  Hide Navigation tabs: Â  In addition to customizing the file for the page to indicate that an SLA is required, you must also modify the templates so that the proper navigation tabs display for the contact that is logged in. For further information, refer to the online documentation for Set an SLA Condition for Displaying Page Content. Evaluate the Support Home page: Â  When restricting access to specific pages, if the Support Home page is enabled, review the home.php file. Â  Consider editing home.php Â to remove reference to features that your general audience cannot access."

Notifying sibling owners when an answer is updated;Answer ID 1870;;['Answer ID 2163'];  Answers, Relationships, Siblings Oracle B2C Service, All versions Issue  We have multiple interfaces and multiple languages on our site. If I need to update an answer in one interface, how can I easily notify the owners of the other answers that my answer has been updated?;" Each answer has a specific Answer ID. When two or more answers have the same Meta-Answer ID, they are called siblings. The most common use for sibling answers is with multiple interfaces that use multiple languages. Â In a multiple language site, each answer usually has an equivalent, translated answer for each interface and language. Those translated answers are typically related by a common Meta-Answer ID. That is, an English answer and its corresponding German and French answers share the same Meta-Answer ID. You Â can configure your application so that when one sibling is updated, you can send a notification to the owners of the other siblings. The owner is based on the Assigned field for the answer. You can enable the Sibling Modified answer notification message in each of your interfaces. When this message is enabled, you can create an answer rule that includes the action to send the Sibling Modified message when an answer is updated. Note: Â The Meta-Answer tab is no longer included when working with answers. In order to access and view sibling answers, the appropriate properties must be enabled in the answer workspace. For more information on displaying sibling relationships, refer to Answer ID 2163: Accessing Sibling Answers. To configure your site to notify sibling owners when a rule is updated, use the steps and process below:  Step 1: Enable Sibling Modified Message To enable the Sibling Modified message, use the steps below: 1. Select the Configuration button in your Navigation Set, expand the Site Configuration folder. 2. Open the Interfaces Editor. 3. Select the interface and then the Administrator Notifications button in the ribbon. 4. Expand the Answer section, enable the Sibling Modified checkbox. 5. Click Save. Â   Step 2: Create a Custom Answer Field to Trigger When Message Should be Sent (Optional) When setting up a rule to send sibling notifications, it is best to create a custom answer field to be used in the IF criteria of your answer rule. Â  This field is used to indicate when the sibling modified message should be sent. This allows the knowledge engineer to set the custom field to a certain value which matches the IF criteria of the rule to trigger the rule to send the notification. For example, you could create a custom menu field or radio button named Notify Sibling Owners with Yes and No options. The staff member can manually set the field to Yes to send the Sibling Modified message when there is a significant update. If the edit was minor, such as correcting a spelling or grammatical error, the staff member would leave the custom field to No so that the Sibling Modified message is not sent. Note: Â  If you do not use a custom field to flag the answer when a notification is sent out, the sibling notification will get sent each time an answer is updated, regardless of whether there was a significant content change. That is, without using a custom field, if someone updates an answer to correct a spelling or punctuation error in one language, the sibling message is sent to the sibling owners. This could result in a large number of messages being sent when the sibling owners really would not need to be notified in those cases.  Step 3: Configure the Answer Rule to send the Notification With the message enabled and a custom field in place, you can configure the answer rule to send the Sibling Modified message when an answer is updated and the custom field is set. The actions used in the rule will send the notification and then clear the custom field so that additional messages will only be sent if the custom field is reset. Note: When setting up your answer rulebase, it is best that you have Â at least two rule states: an Â initial rule state that acts on new answers and also a second rule state that is used to act on existing answers. This allows you greater flexibility in handling and routing new and existing answers within your site. In this case, the rule should be added to the existing rule state so that updates to existing answers can trigger the rule. If you do not have any rules needed for your initial state, create a single rule in your initial rule state. The rule should act on all new answers (that is, do not add any specific criteria to the IF section) and then transition to the existing state and continue. The rule to create in your existing state should be something like the following: IF Notify Sibling Owner (your custom field) = Yes (plus any other additional criteria) THEN Add Action &gt; Send Notification to Answer Sibling Assignee(s) Add Action &gt; Set Custom Field &gt; Notify Sibling Owner = No (or unspecified) Save the rule and then be sure to activate the ruleset. Note: If you need to notify someone who is not assigned to the sibling answers, you can include a different action in the answer rule to send a notification to staff members you specify. To do this, set the IF criteria as you deem appropriate and in the THEN section, click Add Action and select Email &gt; Send Escalation Notification and then specify who should receive the answer escalation notification. When using this option, make sure that the Answer Escalated notification message is enabled. This message is enabled using the same steps listed above in the Communication Configuration &gt; Messages table.  Step 4: Verify the Rule Configuration With the rule in place and the rulebase activated, Â you can test your configuration using the steps below: Within your knowledge base, find two sibling answers (they will have the same Meta-Answer ID value) and make sure the sibling answers are assigned to different people. Â   Â  Have one of the owners log in and update the answer. Before saving the update, set the custom field to notify the sibling owners. Include a note in the answer so that the sibling owners can determine how the answer was updated so that they can more easily determine how to update their own answers. Â  You may want to create a custom text area field to use specifically to communicate information between sibling owners.  Â  Log in as the owner of the sibling answer. If the notification is not yet displayed Â at the Communication Center, click the Refresh button on the left side (the icon with the page with the blue arrow) and you should see the notification.  Step 5: Use the Notification to Find Sibling Answers The notification indicates which answer was updated but does not include the Answer IDs for the siblings. You can open the answer that was edited and then open the sibling answer for editing. Open the answer for which the notification was sent. Review the Notes field on the Details tab to determine what kind of edit was made.  Â  Click the Relationships tab and open the appropriate sibling answer for editing.  Â  After editing the sibling answer, click OK to close the sibling pop-up.  Â  Important! At this point, your edits to the sibling answer are not yet saved to the database. You must save the original answer in order to save the changes to the sibling that you modified. Â   Â  That is, Â edits made to the child record (the sibling answer that you edited) are not saved until the parent record (the original answer you opened) Â is saved.  Â  After saving the original answer, preview Â the sibling answer to ensure that the updates were saved correctly. Â    "

Using the Rule Log to troubleshoot rules;Answer ID 1873;What is the Rule Log how do I use it?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Business Rules, Rule Log;"  The Rule Log allows you to check which business rules took effect on a specific incident, answer, contact, or organization of interest. The incident transactions (Audit Log on the Details tab) do not list which business rules applied to the incident. As a result, if you want to check which rules matched a specific incident, you must use the Rule Log. When using the rule log, you must have a specific ID for the item you are checking, namely one of the Â record identifiers listed below:  Incident reference number Answer ID Contact ID Organization ID Opportunity ID Task Â ID  Note: There is no rule log for Chat  The incident reference number and answer ID are obtained from the heading when the incident is open. The contact, organization and opportunity IDs are obtained by hovering over or clicking the ""Info"" button in the top bar when the record is open. To use the rule log, use the steps below:  From the Configuration pane, select Site Configuration &gt; Logs &gt; Rule Log. Select the appropriate value from the Type menu. Enter the ID value and click Search. Each rule that affected the record of interest and time it took effect is listed in the search results.   Please note, when reviewing the active rules for a record, the first rule the record hit is the rule listed on the bottom of the log viewer.      With the list of rules that acted on the record, you can review the active rules for that record type to determine why a specific rule did or did not act on the record as you expected. In a long list of rules, you can click in the left frame of the Rules table and press CTRL+f to open a Find window. Enter the rule name and press Enter to locate the rule. Purging rule log data: By default, the rule log will show only the rules that acted upon a record for the last 30 days. The PURGE_RULE_LOG_FREQ configuration setting specifies the number of days after which Rule Log entries are deleted. The maximum value for this setting is 180. A value of zero will result in the data being deleted after 180 days. The default value is 30 days. For sites with multiple interfaces, the instance of this setting with the smallest value will be used across all interfaces.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.

Answers Viewed report lists non-public answers;Answer ID 1878;;['Answer ID 5168'];  Answers, Analytics; Within the Answers Viewed report, if an answer was published and then removed from the end-user pages, hits to that answer while it was still public are included in the report. For example, if an answer was published through May 15 and then set to a private status, if you run the Answers Viewed report for May, the answer Â is included in the report and displays the number of hits from May 1 through May 15. Hits to private answers: If the answer was made private prior to the date range of your report, the answer can still be included in the report. Â  If an end-user Â viewed the answer when it was public and then saved it to their Favorites list in Internet Explorer, when the end-user tries to use the link from their Favorites list, it Â still counts as a hit, even though the answer is no longer public and displays a Permission Denied message.

Functions used in reports;Answer ID 1884;InÃ‚Â reports, what are the aggregate, string, date, logical, and math functions?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics;"  When creating custom reports, you can define functions of the data to use in a filter or to display in the output column. This allows users to customize both the criteria and output for custom reports and views. Functions are listed as aggregate, string, date, logical, math, and currency. The string, date, logical, and math functions operate on a single value from the database and can be used both when you define filters or when defining output columns. For example, you can calculate the number of incidents in a data set using the count(expression) function. This will return the total number of incidents within that data. Aggregate functions are used to summarize a data set and can be used when you define the output columns of a view or report. As a result, aggregate functions are not available when defining a data set. Aggregate functions return a single total or sum for the dataset of values. Aggregate functions are used quite frequently when defining multiple-level views or reports that allow the user to drill down into specific records. Note:  Â For text fields, such as contacts.email, the default character limit is 255. For text areas, such as incidents.notes, the default character limit is 4000. Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  Â  Aggregate Functions  Â   avg(expr) -- Computes an average value for the expression listed within the parentheses for the data set defined for the report or view. Â   Â count(expr) -- Returns the number of rows or records for the data set defined for the report or view. Â For example, if we have two incidents with i_id's 100 and 101, the expression count(incidents.i_id) would be 2.  Â group_concat(expr, separator[, sort column 1, ASC|DESC][, sort column 2, ASC|DESC][,...]) -- Combines multiple values from data set expr into a delimited list in a single row. The list is delimited by separator and ordered by the specified sort columns. For example, the expression group_concat(threads.note, ',', threads.entered, ASC) returns a comma-delimited list of thread notes ordered by time entered ascending. Â   Â max(expr) -- Returns the largest numerical value, the last string in alphabetical order, or the latest date for the data set defined for the report or view. Â   Â min(expr) -- Returns the smallest numerical value, the first string in alphabetical order, or the earliest date for the data set defined for the report or view. Â   Â sum(expr) -- Returns the sum of the values for the data set defined for the report or view. Â For example, if we have two incidents with i_id's 100 and 101, the expression sum(incidents.i_id) would be 201.  Â sum_distinct(expr, reference) -- Returns the sum of distinct values in an expression for a particular record (reference) rather than for all records of the same type in a table. For example, if you want to calculate the sum of all quotas for a particular sales person, you could add a function of sum_distinct(sa_period2accts.quota, sa_period2accts.acct_id). Â   Â stddev(expr) -- Returns the standard deviation of the data set for the expression listed. For example, the expression stddev(answers.solved_count) returns the standard deviation of all the values in the solved_count column of the answers table. Â   Â first(expr, sort column1[, sort column2][,....]) Â -- Returns the first value of data set expr based on the order of the specified columns. For example, the expression first(threads.note, threads.entered, threads.seq) returns the first thread note in the data set based on time entered and thread sequence. Â   Â last(expr, sort column1[, sort column2][,....]) Â -- Returns the last value of data set expr based on the order of the specified sort Â columns. For example, the expression last(threads.note, threads.entered, threads.seq) returns the Â last thread note in the data set based on time entered and thread sequence. Â    Â  String Functions  Â    Â concat(str1, str2) -- Combines input character strings str1 and str2 into a single output string. Two expressions can be appended with this function. For example, the expression concat('www.', 'global', '.com') returns the value www.global.com. Â   Â instr(str, substr) -- Returns the numeric position Â of the initial occurrence of the substring (the second expression) within the full string specified. For example, the expression instr('RightNow','Now') returns the value 6. Â   Â length(str) -- Returns the length (in characters) of the string. For example, the expression length('cell phones') returns the value 10. Â   Â lower(str) -- Returns the text string in all lowercase characters. For example, the expression lower('RightNow') returns the value rightnow. Â   Â ltrim(str) -- Returns the string without leading spaces. For example, the expression ltrim(' RightNow') returns the value RightNow. Â   Â lpad(str1, X, str2) -- Returns str1 padded on the left with str2 until str1 is X characters long. For example, the expression lpad('Service', 10, '@') returns the value @@@Service. Â   Â rpad(str1, X, str2) -- Returns str1 padded on the right with str2 until str1 is X characters long. For example, the expression lpad('Service', 10, '@') returns the value Service@@@.  Â rtrim(str) -- Returns the string without trailing spaces. For example, the expression rtrim('RightNow ') returns the value RightNow. Â   Â substr(str, start_pos ,length) or substr(str, start_pos) -- Returns a portion of the string starting at the character defined by start_pos (an integer) and ending at the character defined by length (an integer). If length is not indicated, it will return the remainder of the string. Â   Â to_char(expr) -- Converts the numeric expression to a character string. Â   Â to_number(str) -- Converts the character string to a numeric value. If the string is not numeric, this function will return zero. If the string is a combination of numbers and other characters and begins with a number, this function will return only the initial numeric portion. For example, to_number(123ABC) will return 123. Â   Â upper(str) -- Returns the string in all uppercase characters. For example, the expression upper('RightNow')returns the value RIGHTNOW. Â     Â  Date Functions  Â    Â date_add(date, units, interval, round) -- Returns the value of date plus a specified amount of time where date is a datetime type column or a literal string in the format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS. The amount of time to add is specified by units and interval where units must be a positive integer specifying the number of intervals to add, and interval can be SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS, or YEARS. To round the result to the beginning of the specified interval, set the round argument to 1; otherwise, set round to 0 and the result will not be rounded. For example, the expression date_add(2007-03-28 22:35:00, 48, HOURS, 1) will return the value 2007-03-30 22:00:00. Â   Â date_format(date, format) -- Converts the date expression from a datetime datatype to a string and reformats the date to match the format specified by the format expression. Date is a datetime type column or a literal string in the format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MMDD HH:MI:SS. For example, the expression date_format('2007-11-25 22:25:00', 'DAY, MONTH DD, YYYY, HH12:MI PM') returns the value Tuesday, November 25, 2007 10:25 PM. Â   Â date_diff(date, date) Returns the number of seconds occurring between two dates. For example, the expression date_diff('2007-03-26 22:25:00', '2007-03-25 22:25:00') would return the value 86400. Note: To change the output format, use the date_format or time_format function. Â  For example, time_format(date_diff('2007-03-26 22:25:00', '2007-03-25 22:25:00'), 'HH24h Mim SSs') returns 24h 00m 00s. Â  Â   Â date_trunc(date, units) -- Truncates the date to the unit specified by units. For example, the expression date_trunc('2007-11-25 22:25:10', HOURS) returns the value 2007-11-25 22:00:00. Â   Â sysdate() -- Returns the current system date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS. Â   Â time_format (seconds, format) -- Converts seconds to the specified time format. For example, the expression time_format(86610,'HH24 MI SS') returns the value 24 03 30. Â   Â to_date Â (str, format) -- Converts the value entered in str that is in the format specified in format to a date or date/time value. For example, the expression to_date('20090215','YYYYMMDD') returns a value of 02/15/2009. Â   Â rel_date_diff Â (date2, date1, rr_id) -- (Available for August 2011 and later releases.) Returns the number of seconds between two dates, taking holidays and the work hours specified in response requirements into account. For example, if a site's response requirements are configured with work hours from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., the expression rel_date_diff('2011-07-26 22:25:00', '2011-07-25 10:30:00', 1) returns the value 52200. Â   Â date_group Â (seconds, format) -- Groups records together according to a date range that you specify, and include rows for date ranges that have no associated records. If you do not want to return rows for date ranges with no records, you could use date_format instead. For example, if you have incidents created in January and March, but none in February, and create a report with the expression for column A set to date_group(incidents.created,'YYYY-MM'), and the expression for column B set to count(*), the report would output: 2011-01 10, 2011-02 0, 2011-03 15. Â    Â  Logical Functions  Â    Â if(expression, then result, else result) -- Returns the then result if the expression is true, and returns the else result if the expression is false. For example, the expression if(incident. custom_field=1, 'Yes', 'No') would return Yes for a value of 1 and No for a value of 0. Â   Â decode(expression, test value 1, result 1[next test value, next result] [,default]) -- Compares the expression to the test value and executes result if expression matches test value. If expression and result do not match, default will be executed. The decode function can perform table lookups, allowing you to use text strings as test values rather than requiring coded values (for example, you can use Review as a test value for the expression faqs.status even though the table contains the code value in the status column). For example, you can use the decode function in the Color Expression field to change the display color of incidents with different escalation levels using the following color expression:(incidents.escllevel, 0, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢defaultÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, 1, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢greenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, 2, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢yellowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, 3, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢redÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) Â   Â  Â nvl(expr1, expr2) -- If the value expr1 is null, this function returns the value expr2. However, if the value expr1 is not null, then the value expr1 is returned. The value of expr2 must match the datatype of expr1. Â    Â  Math Functions  Â    Â bitand(X, Y) -- Returns the bitwise AND of two integers, X and Y. Â   Â ceiling(X) -- Returns the smallest integer value greater than or equal to X. Â   Â floor(X) -- Returns the largest integer less than or equal to X. Â   Â power(X,Y) -- Returns the value of X to the power of Y. For example, power(2,3) would return 8. Â   Â round(X,D) -- Returns the value X rounded to the nearest number with D decimals. For example, round(5.55555,2) returns the value 5.56. Â   Â truncate(X,D) -- Returns the value X truncated to the D decimal places. For example, the expression truncate(5.55555, 2) returns the value 5.55.  Â rand() -- Generates a random number between 0 and 1. This output can be used to produce a random sampling of data. For example, to generate a random sample of incidents, add a column with an expression of rand() to an incidents report and sort on the column. The report will show information for incidents meeting your search criteria, sorted randomly.  Â  Currency Functions    Â cvt_currency(expr, str) -- Converts the currency value expr to the specified currency str. For example, the expression cvt_currency(sa_opportunities.rep_value, 'USD') will return the rep_value in US dollars when ""USD"" is stored as the abbreviation for US dollars in the currencies table. Â   Â make_currency(expr, str) -- Converts expr to the specified currency str. For example, the expression make_currency(100.00, 'USD') will return the expr in U.S. dollars. You can also use replace str with the value dflt to convert the expression to the user's currency. Â   Â to_currency(expr, str) -- Converts expr to a value in str currency. The value is returned as an amount in the user's default currency. The conversion rate used for this function is the exchange rate defined in the exchange_rates table. For example, for a user with a default currency of USD, to_currency(opportunities.mgr_value, `EUR') will return an amount in USD that is equal to the number in the mgr_value converted to Euros.

Sending a page or text message for critical incidents;Answer ID 1887;Is there a way to configure a rule to automatically send a page or text message when a critical incident is submitted?;['Answer ID 2155'];   Business Rules;  It is possible to create an incident Â workflow rule to send a page or text message when a high severity incident is received. The Â Incident Severity field is only used Â within the console. Â This field does not display on the end-user pages. If you wish to allow end-users the ability to set a severity field when they submit the incident from the Ask a Question page, create an incident custom Â field, such as customer_severity, and enable the end-user edit ability for the field. The rule configuration would be similar to the following:  IF Incidents.customer_severity (custom field) equals 1-Critical THEN E-mail Incident Information to: pager@address.com  Or you could route all incidents from a specific company:  IF Incidents.Contact Information matches regular expression *@specificcompany.com THEN E-mail Incident Information to: textmessenger@address.com  The incoming incidents that match your rule trigger the pager to alert staff of the issue. For more information, see Answer ID 2155: Using a severity field with Oracle B2C Service.

Training new employees without having them send responses to incidents;Answer ID 1888;How can we train new employees in using Oracle B2C Service, but not allow them to send responses until the proposed responsesÃ‚Â have been reviewed?;['Answer ID 2155'];  Staff Accounts, Workspaces, Profiles, All versions; When training new staff to create incident responses, you can always have the trainee to compose their responses outside of the Oracle B2C Service application, such as in Microsoft Word or in the body of an email, Â and then email the proposed response to the supervising Â agent for approval and sending. Â  However, you may want them to create proposed responses within the application so that they can gain functional experience in your site as well. You can create a custom profile for new trainees to prevent them from sending incident responses. Â  This allows staff to edit and update incidents without inadvertently sending a response that has not been reviewed and approved. When creating response content, new employees can either add a potential response to the Notes thread or the Response thread. Â  However, if they add content to the Response thread, you should configure their workspace so that their response content is not committed to the thread when the incident is saved. Note: Once a response thread is committed to the incident, that content cannot be edited. For this reason, you do not want new trainees to create response content that can be committed to the incident thread inadvertently. By configuring a workspace to not commit the response to the thread, trainees can add content to the response field and save the incident, but that content is editable when the incident is re-opened later. Since the staff member cannot send responses, that staff member cannot commit the response thread to the incident either. Within the workspace, the Commit Response On Save property with the Incident Thread relationship item indicates whether the response thread will be committed to the thread when the incident is saved. For the workspace used by new trainees, be sure that this property is set to False. Therefore, to configure your site to allow trainees the ability to add proposed responses to incidents but not send them, use the steps below: Create a custom incident workspace and open it for editing.  Â  Click the Â Incident Thread relationship item (by default this item is on the body of the Messages tab).  Â  Set the Commit Response On Save property to False / disabled.  Â  Configure the rest of the workspace as you wish.  Â  Save the workspace.  Â  Create a multi-edit incident workspace for the staff member Â and set the Commit Response On Save property to Â False as well. Â   Â  Create a new staff profile and open it for editing.  Â  Click the Service tab and disable the Send Response check box.  Â  Set the incident workspace and the multi-incident workspace to the custom workspaces you created above.  Â  Save the profile.  Â  Create or open the staff account record and set the profile to be the profile you just created.  With this configuration, new employees can access the incidents to create response content for review by a supervisor or senior staff member. Even if you have new hires add response content to the Notes field, this configuration prevents response content from being inadvertently sent or committed to the incident thread by a new staff member.

Adding a new answer to my site;Answer ID 1889;How do I add a new answer to my site?;['Answer ID 1034', 'Answer ID 2162', 'Answer ID 1112', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Creating New Answers Oracle B2C Service;"  Typically, when adding a new answer to your knowledgebase, you will use the major steps below:  Add a new non-public answer to your knowledgebase. Edit and preview the answer. Publish the answer to your end-user pages.  Creating a New Non-Published Answer  You can add an answer in several ways:  You can propose an answer from an existing Â incident. You can add a stand-alone answer. You can add a sibling Â answer to an existing answer (which share the same products and categories). You can copy an existing answer. You can copy an answer to be a stand-alone answer or copy the answer to be a sibling.  Note: Sibling Â answers (options 3 and 4) are typically used only with privileged access and multi-language sites. Sibling answers allow you to group very highly related answers together. Basically, all of the sibling Â answers Â answer the same question, but the content of the information provided may differ depending on your audience -- either due to privileged access or a different language. Sibling answers reside in the same meta-answer and share common products and categories. Â  That is, if you change the product or category value for an answer, you also change the product and category for all sibling answers. Option 1: Proposing an Answer from an Existing Incident Â  To propose an answer from an existing incident, highlight the incident in a report and click the Propose button in the toolbar or right click on the incident and select Propose. Staff can also click Propose from an open incident. In the pop-up window, staff can modify the Summary, Question, Answer, and Notes field as well as modify the product and category selections before clicking OK which creates the new answer. The new answer is created with a Proposed status and is unassigned. The first customer thread entry is entered in the Question field and the remainder of the thread populates the Answer field. The incident is copied to the Answer Console as a new answer that has a Proposed status and is unassigned to a staff member. The entire incident thread is copied into the Question field. See Answer ID 1034: Information copied when an incident is proposed as an answer Â for more information. Option 2: Adding a New Stand-alone Answer Â  You can also create new stand-alone answers directly to the application if your staff profile allows answers to be created and edited. Â  If your site does not use privileged access and supports only one language, all of your answers should be stand-alone answers that do not have siblings. This ensures that answers can be published and accessible independently of one another.  From the top toolbar, click New &gt; Answer. Â  Â    Complete the Summary, Status, Access Level, Language, Content tab, Products/Categories tab, and Details tab. Note that the layout of tabs and fields when editing answers is defined by the answer workspace, which may be customized by an administrator.   Click Save.  Option 3: Adding or Sibling Answer to an Existing Answer Â  Note: Sibling answers should only be used if your site uses privileged access or multiple language packs. With privileged access and multi-language sites, multiple answers can be set up as siblings so that they are more closely related to one another and share the same product and category values. For example, if you have an English and Spanish interface, you could have two sibling answers that are related -- one answer that is published to the English interface, the other published to the Spanish interface. If you were to add a French interface to your site, you could add a third sibling answer to each of your sibling groups (meta-answers). This allows you to keep the translations of each answer closely related. Typically, if you are using privileged access, each sibling answer will have a unique access level. Similarly, if you are using multiple languages, each sibling answer Â will be assigned to a unique language. You can have sibling answers that have the same access level and language combination, which means multiple sibling answers can be published to a single interface. Â  To add a new sibling Â answer to an existing answer: use the steps below. Â When you add a sibling answer, the products and categories are pre-selected to match the values of the existing answer. Any changes you make to the products and categories affect ALL sibling answers for that group of siblings. In order to add a sibling answer, the answer workspace must include the Answer Relationship item within the workspace. In addition, when you click on the Answer Relationship item, the SiblingVisible property must be set to True in order to see the siblings listed. In order to Â use the steps below, you may need to modify the answer workspace to enable the Sibling Visible property. Â   Open the existing answer and click the Relationships tab. Â    In Siblings Answer section, click Add &gt; Add New or Add Existing. Â  If adding a new answer, add content and click OK. If adding an existing answer, search for the answer you want to add as a sibling (by Answer ID or by text) and click Select. In the Move Siblings pop-up specify which answer should be moved to the other answers sibling set. Â  If both answers are stand-alone answers, it does not matter which answer actually moves. Â    When the sibling answer displays on the Relationships tab, save the original answer.  Another option is to copy the existing answer as a sibling and then modify the copy. Option 4: Copying Â an Existing Answer Â  You can copy an answer to either be a sibling answer to the answer that is copied or copy the answer to be a sibling of the answer being copied.  From a report that lists the answer to be copied, highlight the answer in the report and click Copy in the toolbar. Or right click on the answer and select Copy. Â    In the pop-up window, set the status, access level and language of the new answer. If you wish to copy existing file attachments to the new answer, enable the Copy File Attachments box. Â    To create a sibling answer, enable the Create Sibling Relationship checkbox. If clear, the new answer will be a stand-alone answer. Â    The new answer opens in edit mode so that you can modify the content. Â  When finished, click Save.  For more information, refer to Answer ID 2162: Copying an answer.  Previewing Your Answer  To preview the answer, use the Search icon to search for the answer so that the answer is listed in the answer grid. Then right click on the answer and select Preview Answer, or highlight the answer and click the Preview icon in the top right corner. The answer will display in a new window. Links to web pages (using the standard HTML link format with the ""a href"" tag) are active from the preview page. However, file attachments and links to other answers are disabled on the preview page.  Publishing Your Answer  To publish the answer, open the answer for editing. Set the status to be a public status type (i.e. Public), the access level to a value that is visible to the end-user pages for the interface (i.e. Everyone), and set the product and category (if enabled) to values that are visible to the end-user interface. For more information on publishing answers to your site, refer to Answer ID 1112: Publishing an answer to the end-user pages.

Editing multiple records at the same time;Answer ID 1894;How can I edit multiple records at the same time?;['Answer ID 2466'];   Analytics, Workspaces, Inline Editing Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  The multi-edit Â feature can be used to modify multiple records (up to 250) Â at the same time. This feature allows you to edit multiple incidents, answers, contact records, and organization records with one edit. As a result, you have greater ability to manage the content of your database. Â  Â Please note, this feature Â does not allow you to multi-edit Staff Accounts as you can with incidents, answers, contact records, and organization records. Note: Â  Dependent on your site, you may not be able to edit an entire group of 250 records at once. Â  There could be other factors that limit the Â 250 record limit - the complexity of the records being edited, the amount of resources on a client machine, network traffic, etc. Important! For staff members whose profile includes delete privileges, the multi-edit feature also allows you to delete multiple incidents, contacts, organizations or answers. Use extreme caution when deleting multiple records. When records have been deleted, they are completely removed from the database and cannot be retrieved. In addition, if you delete a contact record, all of the associated incidents are also deleted along with all of the sales opportunities where that contact was listed as a primary contact. If you delete an organization, you delete all of the contacts and their incidents and associated sales opportunities as well.  Types of Records  When multi-editing records, the fields that can be modified are controlled by the multi-edit workspace that is named in the staff member's profile. This allows administrators the ability to add or remove specific fields that can be edited for multiple records. (See Answer 2466: Including fields in a workspace for information on how to modify fields in a workspace.) To determine which workspace is used by a staff member, open the staff member's account to determine their staff profile and then open that profile to determine which workspace is used to multi-edit the type of record you are interested in. Contacts and Organizations: With contacts or organizations records, use the multi-select feature to change the value of menu, and radio custom fields. In addition, with contact records, you can enable or disable the contacts and change the contact Type. Answers: With answers, you can use the multi-select feature to set menu and radio custom fields. You can also change the status, the staff member the answer is assigned to, and you can add an internal note to all the answers if necessary. Incidents: With incidents, you can modify menu and radio fields as well as the incident queue, status, and staff member the incident is assigned to. You can also add content to the Customer Entry, Response, and Notes fields and send responses to the contacts listed for the incidents. Opportunities: With sales opportunities, you can modify menu and radio custom fields as well as summary information including the Assigned, Territory, Status, Strategy, Sales Stage, Closed and Forecast Close system fields. Tasks: With tasks, you can change the assignment, including the opportunity. In addition, you can edit the due date, planned completion date and actual completion dates.  Editing Multiple Records From Report Results Â   With the appropriate report, search for the group of records that you wish to multi-edit (for example, answers, incidents, contacts, organizations, or tasks). The records to edit should be listed in the search results of the report. To select a subset of items from a larger group, press the Control key and individually select the items you wish to edit from the records in the view grid. To highlight a consecutive list of items, click the first item in the list, press the Shift key, and click on the last item. Right click and select Â Open or Edit Â &gt; Record and select the appropriate tab and field(s) to edit.   Note: The fields available depend on what has been added to the Â multi-edit workspace for the data type. Â   Â    Edit the fields as appropriate. Click Save or Save and Close.  Editing Multiple Records Using Â the Ribbon Â   With Â Inline Editing enabled in a report, press Ctrl while selecting each record. Click the Home tab. Click the Edit Selection button. A menu displays the fields that can be edited in the rows.   Note: Not all fields are available for inline editing.   Select the field that you want to edit. Edit the fields as appropriate. Click the OK button to apply the changes to the selected records.  Note: Â  When a report is inserted into a workspace, there is no functionality to use the Multi-Edit feature. Â  Â The report needs to be run from the Navigation Set, or the Analytics Console for the Multi-Edit feature to be available."

Indexing keywords and phrases for answers;Answer ID 1914;How are keywords and phrases indexed for our published answers?;['Answer ID 1309', 'Answer ID 1301'];   Answers, Keyword and Phrase Indexing Oracle B2C Service;"  When an answer is saved, the answer's content is indexed in the knowledge base, and the answer is instantly available for searching. Single words and 2- and 3-word phrases are eligible to be indexed for an answer. Two factors determine whether a word or phrase is indexed: words specifically excluded from searching and a limitation on the number of words and phrases that can be indexed for a specific answer. URL and File Attachment type answers: Â  Â You can create two additional types of answers -- URL and attachment.  URL Answers - When you create a URL answer, an external URL address will display to customers on the customer portal. When customers click the URL, an external web page opens in a new window. URL answers are also indexed as searchable text on the customer portal. You can still define many of the same answer fields as in HTML answers. However, some fields (such as the Question and Answer fields) are unavailable when adding a URL answer. The exact fields available depend on the permissions set in your profile. File Attachment Answers - You can add file attachment answers to link to information contained in another document. File attachment answers contain many of the same answer fields as in HTML answers. However, some fields (such as the Question and Answer fields) are unavailable when adding file attachment answers. The exact fields available depend on the permissions set in your profile. You can attach only one file for each answer. File attachment answers are also indexed as searchable text on the customer portal.   The sections below apply to standard, HTML answers saved within the Oracle B2C Service application. These answers include the Summary, Question, and Answer fields.  Excluded Words List Â  exclude_answers.txt This file contains common words such as prepositions, adverbs, and pronouns that are excluded from indexing and searching functions on the customer portal. If you have specific words that you do not want customers to be able to search on, you can add these stopwords to the exclude_answers.txt file to exclude them from being indexed. Stopwords must be uppercase and typed on separate lines.  Note: Words in this file are also excluded when using SmartAssistant to search for an answer.  To view the contents of the exclude file, use the steps below:   Go to the Configuration items, select Site Configuration &gt; File Manager. Select the appropriate interface from the Available Interfaces menu. From the Switch to: menu, select wordlist files. Click the file name to open the file and review the alphabetical list. Â The word list file that excludes words from being indexed is named exclude_answers.txt. Â   Note: If you choose to remove words from the list, you will need to rebuild the phrases table for your answers. For more information on modifying the exclude file, refer to Answer ID 1309: Excluding specific words or phrases from searching.  Phrase Indexing Limitation  When dealing with answers that include lengthy content, there is a limit of 750 (500 for incidents) Â as to the number of unique words and phrases indexed for each answer. Â Words and phrases located towards the end of longer answers may not be indexed and as a result may not be searchable. When adding and editing answer content, the application indexes words and phrases based on the fields they are used in. The content is indexed in the following order:   Keywords Summary Question Answer Flagged file attachments  For long answers, you can enter important keywords and phrases into the Keywords field when editing the answer. This ensures that those words and phrases will be indexed for that answer and are searchable. Note: When entering multiple words and phrases into the Keywords field, be sure to separate entries with a comma to ensure optimal performance. For more information on the Keywords field when editing answers, refer to Answer ID 1301: Keywords field when editing answers. Another option when dealing with longer answers is to consider breaking the answer into smaller, separate answers so that more of the overall content is indexed across several answers. Answers with fewer words are not adversely affected by the phrase limitation and may be easier for an end user to find and comprehend. Note that this phrase indexing limitation was implemented by design in order to manage the overall size of the phrases table in the database. In the interests of maintaining an effective and efficient knowledge base, we recommend that answers be composed as succinctly and concisely as possible. This is important not only for the benefit of end users who must absorb the information, but for increasing the accuracy of their searches. An overabundance of indexed keywords often makes searches less accurate, not more accurate."

Moving a staff account to another group;Answer ID 1915;How do I move a staff account to another group?;['Answer ID 1004', 'Answer ID 4392'];   Staff Accounts;  Before moving an account to another staff group, review the records assigned to that staff member, such as incidents, answers, and opportunities to determine if those records should be reassigned to another staff member. For more information on the effects of moving an account, refer to Answer ID 1004: Effect on other tables when a staff account is deleted or moved To move a staff account, open the standard 'Staff Accounts by Group' report under Staff Management. Â  You can open an account for edit and change the group that way, or you can simply drag the staff record into another group listed on the left.  Dependency Checks: When you move a staff account, the system does a check to see where that account is referenced. Â For example, the system checks for where the account is used in rules. If the specific account is used in a rule (such as incidents being assigned or emailed to that account), then you will get a 'Dependency Conflict' Â pop-up message when you try to move the account. The message indicates which rules, views, and reports include actions or criteria for that specific staff account. Before you can move the account to another group, you must edit each rule, view, or report listed to remove the specific reference to the account. For example, if a rule assigns incidents to the staff member, you must first edit the rule to either remove that action or assign the incidents to another staff member. If you remove that action from the rule, then that rule is no longer dependent on that account. Similarly, if a report filters incidents by the staff member, you must remove that filter from the report before you can move the account to another group. Once all of the dependencies are cleared for the account, you can then move the account. For information on changing the display order of staff accounts, refer to Answer link 4392: Changing the order of staff accounts in the assigned field.

Cached data used in reports;Answer ID 1917;Which database tables and standard reports are cached?;['Answer ID 8997', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Automatic Caching All versions;  There are two different types of report caching. The first is automatic and has to do with the underlying data Â of which your database is constructed. This is the feature discussed in this answer. The alternate option is caching you can schedule. Â  Â Refer to Answer 8997: Cache reports and dashboards at scheduled times Â for more information on that option. When using the reports feature in your Â Oracle B2C Service Â application, you should understand caching and how it affects your report data. To have access to accurate report data quickly, the agedatabase utility should be scheduled to run every night. When agedatabase runs, it will cache much of the report data to prepare for the following dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reporting needs. This enables reports to be generated more quickly -- especially those reports that display a large amount of data. Many of the reports are generated solely on cached data. Some reports, however, produce real-time results when the report is generated. Cached data will remain constant throughout the day and will not be updated until the next day. For this reason, reports using cached data will not have data for the current date. Real-time data may change as incidents are added, updated, or deleted from your database. Understanding which reports use cached or real-time data is essential to accurately interpret your reports. Some database tables that have cached data are:  inc_performance session_summary stats (some fields) opp_performance opp_snapshots revenue_snapshots pipeline_snapshots rnl_staff_engaged gap_info dt_stats  Therefore, if you are using fields from these tables in a custom report, the data in your report is cached and the agedatabase utility must run in order for the data to be updated.  Purging report statistics: Â The default settings are configured so that reporting statistics are not purged from the database. In previous versions, the default was to purge report data older than 187 days. The PURGE_DELETE_STATS configuration setting specifies the number of days after which reporting statistics are removed from the database.  Reports using cached data: To determine which standard reports in your application used cached data, run the report and Â view the report definition by clicking the Report tab and selecting View Definition. Check the tables listed to determine if Â any are the cached tables listed above.  For Â more information regarding standard reports in your application, refer to the Â Report Management, or Agedatabase Caching Â for more information on cached data.

Number of contacts associated with an organization;Answer ID 1918;How many contacts can I associate with an organization?;['Answer ID 2179'];   Contact to Organization association within Oracle B2C Service (OSvC);  Within Oracle B2C Service, there is no hard limit regarding the number of contact records that can be associated with an organization. However, in cases where hundreds of contacts are associated to a single organization, you will likely see performance issues arise regarding opening incidents and organizations. The more contacts that are associated with an organization, the more likely it is that your staff members will experience delays when opening the org record or associated records, including incidents and contacts.  Â  Impact of Numerous Contacts Associated with an Organization Record: Â If you have too many contact records associated with an organization, opening that organization record (or any incident or contact record associated with that organization) can take several minutes to load. In cases where an organization has more than 500 contacts, users typically experience lengthy load times at the Support Console when editing or viewing incidents or contact records for that organization as well as the organization record itself. This situation where an organization record has hundreds of contacts typically arises when an organization has a large number of employees and contacts or if you have set up privileged access so that all contacts with a certain level of privileged access are associated to the same organization.  Â  To Alleviate this Issue: Create additional organizations and reassign several contact records to the new organization records. This allows you to distribute the numerous contact records across several related organizations. If necessary, apply Service Level Agreements to your new organizations so that your contacts retain their same level of privileged access and support. Once you have created the additional, related organizations, you can use the organization hierarchy feature to establish parent and child relationships between the organization records. For more information on organization hierarchy, refer to Answer ID 2179: Using Organization Hierarchy.  Â  In addition, Â with regard to privileged access and service level agreements, you can set up contact rules to assign SLA instances directly to the contact records so that privileged access can be granted to your contacts using rules and you do not need to associate several contact records to an organization at all. In order to assign the SLA to the contact record, the contact cannot be associated with an organization. This approach prevents you from having to relate groups of records together that are not truly related based on a common group, company, or organization.

Creating an 'internal' incident for a contact;Answer ID 1919;"How can we create an ""internal"" incident for a contact?";['Answer ID 48', 'Answer ID 2617'];"   Incidents  Issue   When certain types of issues arise, such as a customer complaint, we want to attach the issue to the contact's account. However, we want to keep this incident as ""internal"" information only and we do not want it shared with the contact via the Account - Support History page. How can we create an ""internal"" incident for a contact?";"  You can create an incident that contains private information and associate it to a contact record without displaying the information to the contact. By copying the ""internal"" content into the Notes field of the incident, staff members can view the content from the administrative pages. The contact, however, cannot view the contents of the Notes field. Because an incident does exist, the contact could access the incident as part of their history from the Account - Support History page. As such, you can enter some text into the Customer Entry or Response field so that the contact can view some general content for that incident. Another option is to create a custom incident status, such as ""Internal"", and assign these incidents to that status. Then, on the Account - Support History page, you can include a filter that excludes the Internal status from displaying. Reports on the administrative side (i.e. included in a contact workspace) Â could allow the Internal custom status so that staff members could easily see these incidents. For more Â information on incident statuses, refer to Answer ID 48: Default incident and answer statuses. For information on customizing this page, refer to Answer ID 2617: Customizing the Support History &gt; Questions report."

Creating reusable content for Outreach documents;Answer ID 1924;How do I create reusable content for use with several mailings?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Outreach,Ã‚Â Feedback Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Reusable content is helpful if certain blocks of content are used more than once in different Â mailings and surveys. Defining reusable content allows you to store sections of content that can be used at a later time as many times as you need. For comprehensive information on creating reusable content, refer to Â the Â Outreach and Feedback section of the documentation Â for your release. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Note: Â  Reusable content in the Content Library Â is configured separately and is independent from the standard text items used with incidents or variables used with answers. Standard text items and variables must be configured from the Service Configuration items in Â the application. Standard text and variables cannot be used as reusable content with mailings and surveys. Â  Â  If you would like to use a block of content in mailings and surveys Â as well as with incident responses, you must configure both a reusable content item Â for use with mailing and surveys as well as define Â a standard text response in the Service Configuration items.  By default, all reusable content is kept in the Content Library. Â  The Content Library allows you to organize and manage different types of reusable content, including Â documents, files, templates, tracked links Â and snippets. Â  This content can be used with surveys, mailings, campaigns, and web pages.  Tracked Links - used to track how many times a link was clicked from your mailing. Â  Tracked links can be included in templates, documents, snippets and mailings.   Snippet Â  - sections of reusable content that can be inserted into templates, documents, and mailings. Â  Can be HTML or text format.   Files - Â define specific files to be used with your mailings. Links to files can be added to documents, templates, snippets, Â and mailings. Â Files Â are not attached directly to the mailing, but rather a link to the file is included in the mailing.   Template - reusable design containing headers and footers Â of your Â document or survey. Â When used in a Â document or survey, it cannot be edited.   Documents Â - can be either HTML or text format. Â Documents can be based on templates and can include snippets, tracked links or files.

Changes carried forward at production cutover;Answer ID 1925;Which changes are carried forward from production at cutoverÃ‚Â and which changes are from the upgrade site?;['Answer ID 9638', 'Answer ID 9638'];   Oracle B2C Service (formerly known as Oracle Service Cloud);"  -If Â enrolled in AUP: Custom files will be synced from the production site to the upgrade site approximately 8 hours prior to cutover through a Â feature called File Sync. This allows customers to make changes to custom files on the production site during the update process without losing the changes. Please note: Â File Sync does not sync message base or Â configuration setting edits. Nor does it sync Â production file changes made within 8 hours of cutover. File Sync does not automatically sync deleted files from the production site to the upgrade site either. Changes to custom files on the upgrade site will not be recoverable after cutover.  ----- -If completing a legacy update: Â  Please do not make any changes to custom files (including Customer Portal files) during the update Â unless the change is deemed business critical. Â  You must then replicate the production changes on the upgrade site to avoid losing the changes at cutover. When a Oracle B2C Service Â site is updated Â to a new version, the database from the existing production site is merged with the configuration files of the upgrade site. Â  The table below is applicable for legacy updates only, with Â two exceptions. Â Message bases and configuration settings are impacted equally by AUP and legacy updates. Â The table illustrates where each feature/component change is Â retained from after the upgrade cutover. This means that if you make changes to the feature/component for the site from the table below, those changes will be retained after the update.

By disabling the staff member's ability to add, read, or edit organization records, they cannot access the organization workspace editors. Note: Even with the features on the Organization tab disabled in the profile, workspaces are listed on that page. However, since the staff member cannot access org records in any capacity, it does not matter which workspaces are listed. To access staff profiles, from Configuration, select Staff Management &gt; Â  Profiles. Workspaces: Organization information can also be referred to from other workspaces that include organization fields and tabs.

Differences between contact lists and segments in Outreach;Answer ID 1927;What's the difference between a contact list and a segment in Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service;" With Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service, you can define groups of Â contacts to whom mailings are sent. Â You can define lists and segments. A list is a static group of names. Â  The list includes specific contacts that you select. This list Â remains the same over time until you manually add or remove contacts from the list. Â You can add or remove contacts from your list at a later time as you need to. From the navigation pane select Â Audience &gt; Contact Lists Explorer. To add a new contact list, click the New button on the Â ribbon. To edit an existing contact list, right-click Â the contact list and click open.  Â  You can also upload contacts to a list using the Contact Uploader. Â Create the list first in your site and then when you upload the contacts, you can Â set the uploader to assign the contacts to the list. Â  A segment is a dynamic group of contacts based on specific criteria (filters) that you specify. For example, you can specify a segment to be all men between the ages of 18 and 30 or another segment as all contacts who reside in California. You can specify multiple filters for your segment. Once a segment is created, it can be used in mailings. The specific group of contacts involved is generated with each mailing. As a result, as contacts are added to your records, contacts may be included in the segment, even though you do not specifically add that record by name. Similarly, if you edit a record and it no longer matches the segment criteria, that contact will no longer be included in the segment. From the navigation pane select Audience &gt; Segment Explorer. To add a new segment, click the New button on the ribbon. To edit an existing segment, right-click Â the Â segment and click open.

Setting up incident response requirements and holidays;Answer ID 1932;How do I set up default response requirements and holidays?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Service Level Agreements, Response Requirments;" You Â can configure default response requirements and holidays to be used with all incidents submitted to your site. You can also set up separate response requirements and holiday schedules that are associated with service level agreements (SLAs) so that preferred customers that have the SLA have customized response requirements and/or holidays. Oracle B2C Service uses the holidays and response requirements to determine a due date for each incident. The application also determines resolution times and compares the actual response and resolution times to the requirements. If Â Oracle Service Chat is enabled, you can define chat hours independently from the response requirements. The path to configure chat hours is: Path: Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Interfaces &gt; Chat Hours Holidays To configure your default response requirements, you must first set up the holidays. To define holidays, use the steps below: From the Configuration items, select Service &gt; Service Level Agreements &gt; Holidays.  Â  On the ribbon, click on the ""New"" button Â to add a new Â Holiday.  Â  In the right frame, enter the name of the holiday and the date.  Â  Check the appropriate interface box to have the holiday included for the interface.  Â  Click Save.  Â  Add additional holidays as appropriate. Note: For annual holidays, you must either add a holiday for each year or you must edit the existing holiday each year to update the current year. For example, it is not possible to configure Christmas to be December 25 for every year. You must set a specific year and then either edit the existing holiday or add another Christmas holiday for next year. Note that holidays must be added for each year and for that reason we suggest using a naming convention like ""4th of July 2012"". We also suggest adding new holidays instead of modifying old ones as past holidays are used to calculate metrics.  Response Requirements After you have added your holidays, you can configure your response requirements using the steps below: From the Configuration items, select Service &gt; Service Level Agreements &gt; Â Response Requirements. Â   Â  In the left frame, right click on the interface name and edit the Response Requirement. Â   Â  In the right frame, complete the following: Service Intervals: Click the New Â icon for each day and set the start and end times for which you provide support and respond to incidents. This defines the general work hours for your organization. Response Time (Minutes): Enter the maximum number of minutes allowed (based on the work hours defined) for agents to provide an initial response to an incident. For example, if an initial response must go out within 6 work hours, enter 360. Resolution Time (Minutes): Enter the number of minutes allowed (based on the work hours defined) for the agent to resolve an issue. For example, if incidents must be resolved within 16 work hours, enter 960. Holidays Observed: Select which holidays should suspend the default response requirements. That is, if the holiday is highlighted, the response requirements are not applied to that holiday. Use the CTRL key to select multiple holidays. Â   Â  Click Save. Note: To delete a work interval, place the cursor in the row to delete and press the Delete icon ( ).  Response Requirements for SLAs If you define separate service level agreements (SLAs), you can define custom response requirements for each SLA. That is, for a certain SLA, you might have different response and resolution times or you might provide support on some holidays that you don't support for your general customer base. Note: In order for the SLA response requirements to take affect on an incident, the incident must have the SLA applied to it. When the incident is open, the SLA field must be set to the appropriate SLA value in order for those response requirements to be in affect. To define response requirements for an SLA, use the steps below: From the Configuration items, select Service &gt; Service Level Agreements &gt; Service Level Agreements.  Â  In the left frame, click on the SLA name to edit or for a new SLA, click the ""New"" button on the ribbon.  Â  In the Interface label section, click the Edit link in the Response Requirements column, a new window will pop up.  Â  Similar to defining the default requirements, configure the Intervals, Response Time, Resolution Time and Holiday Observed fields.  Â  Click Â OK in the pop-up window to save the response requirements.  Â  Click Save to save the SLA.  "

Creating section breaks and sub-totals in a custom report;Answer ID 1934;How do I create section breaks and sub-totals in my custom report?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Rollups, Calculations;"  Sections of similar data are created by adding rollups to your report. Rollups group Â rows of your report Â based on similar values for a specific field. For example, in an incident report, you can use a rollup to group incidents by status or by staff member so that all incidents assigned to a specific or staff member are grouped together. With a rollup configured for the report, you can then right click on a column value and add calculations such as total, average, maximum and minimum to display for the rollup (for each section) or for the overall report. Note: Â  These steps define how to add rollups and calculations to a report so that the rollups and calculations display when the report is run. Â  Â You can also modify a report after it is generated and include rollups and calculations.  To add a rollup to your report:  Open the report for editing.   From the Home tab, click Rollups &gt; Choose Columns. Â    In the pop-up window, select the field to group by and indicate whether the groups should be sorted ascending or descending in order.   To display an overall group count for the report, enable the Display Group Counts checkbox.   Click OK.   Preview your report. From the Home tab, select Views &gt; Report View and run the report. Â  Â   Verify the report output and return to design mode for your report. Â    If you do not want to add section calculations, you can save the report.  To add section calculations:  From design mode in your report, right click on a column and select Edit Calculations.

Conditional sections included in mailings;Answer ID 1935;What are conditional sections that can be included in outbound mailings?;['Answer ID 1954'];   Mailings All versions;"  You can add sections of content to your documents that appear only to contacts who meet certain criteria. For example, you could add conditional sections for contacts who reside in a certain state or use a specific product. This conditional grouping is identified based on fields in the database, including custom fields. When adding a conditional section, you use must Â associate a segment for which the conditional section applies. The segment uses filters Â and criteria to define your conditional group. The conditional section is inserted in the document and then you type the conditional text within the section borders. When creating a conditional section, it may be necessary to create the complementary section as well. That is, if your conditional section notifies customers in California of specific information, you might need to create a conditional section for all non-California residents that includes information for the remainder of your contact base.  To add a conditional section to a mailing, use the steps below:  Select New &gt; Mailing to open the mailing editor.   Select the type of mailing -- Broadcast or Transactional.   On the Message tab, add the content for your mailing.   To add a conditional section, from the Dynamic Content section, click Conditional Section.   In the pop-up window, select the segment for which the conditional section applies and click OK.

Resizing the columns in the record grid;Answer ID 1938;Can I resize the columns in the record grid when viewing incident and answer lists?;['Answer ID 1954'];  Analytics, Column Formatting; You can dynamically resize the column widths in your report. Hover over the column divider and drag and drop the divider to a new location in the report. Dynamically resizing column widths does not alter the column width defined in the report. That is, if you close the report and re-open it later, the column widths default to the sizes configured in the report -- not the column width you last used. You would need to resize the column width again. To change the column width defined in the report, use the steps below: Open the report for editing. Right-click on an output column and select Edit Format. Click the Width tab and specify Best Fit or Specific Width. If configuring a specific width, enter the numerical value and specify the dimension. Click OK to close the window. Edit the width of other columns as you wish. Save the report. When configuring column widths, the Best Fit option determines the column width based on the number of columns and how much data is included in each column. The Specific Width option allows you to define a fixed width in your report. Grid reports and column widths: With a grid report, if some columns are configured with a specific width and some have the best fit, the application favors the specific width and fixes those widths. Â  Then, the best fit columns are sized based on the remaining width of the console. If all columns are set to a specific width, the report may be narrower than the console if the total width is less than the console width. Â  If the total report width is wider than the console, each column is resized proportionally so that the report fits within the console. With standard reports, the columns are not resized and a horizontal scroll bar displays to allow access to the information to the right of what is shown in the console.

Applying SLAs to an organization or contact;Answer ID 1944;How do I apply a service level agreement (SLA) to an organization or contact?;['Answer ID 1837', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Service Level Agreements (SLAs);  If a contact record is associated to an organization, you can only apply the SLA instance to the organization so that the SLA applies to all contacts for that organization. The only time an SLA can be applied to a contact record is if the contact is a stand-alone contact and is not associated to an organization. For more information on creating SLAs, refer to Answer ID 1837: Creating SLAs. Note: These steps associate an SLA to the contact or organization. This does not mean that the SLA is automatically associated to incidents submitted by that contact or organization. In cases where incidents need to be assigned to a specific SLA instance based on your support requirements, staff can manually specify the SLA instance for an incident, or you can use incident rules to apply the SLA instance to the incident based specific criteria you set (for example, based on custom fields). Â  Also note, that once an SLA is modified, its original terms still apply to an organization that was associated with it before the terms were changed. Â   Applying multiple SLAs: Â  When multiple SLAs are applied to an organization or contact record, the features and functionality allowed by the SLAs complement one another. Â  That is, if one SLA grants access to a feature and another SLA denies access, the contact or organization is granted the privilege since at least one of the SLAs grants the privilege. For example, Â if an organization has Â 2 SLAs associated with it where: Â   One SLA grants access to a privileged access level, but does not allow users to submit any incidents via the Ask a Question page or via email. That is the Self-Service Incidents and Email Incidents fields are set to 0.   The second SLA does not grant privileged access but allows unlimited incidents to be submitted from the Ask a Question page -- Â  the Self-Service Incidents Â field is blank.  With these two SLAs Â associated to an organization, contacts for that organization have privileged access based on the first SLA. Â  Those contacts can also submit unlimited incidents from the Ask a Question page based on the second SLA. Since SLAs complement each other in this fashion, this allows you to create SLAs for a specific purpose. Then, you can Â assign multiple Â SLAs to Â the records. Â  The ability to apply SLAs is controlled by the contact or organization workspace used by the staff member. The workspace must have the SLA Container relationship item added to the workspace with the Read Only property set to allow editing (for example, set to Never). To add an SLA instance to a contact or organization record, use the steps below:  Open for the contact or organization record. If you just added the SLA to the Service Level Agreements table, you must actually perform a search for the record (either from a report or with Quick Search) and then open the record. This allows the new SLA to be included in the SLAs that can be added.  Â  Opening a record from the Recent Items list does not refresh the list of available SLAs in the record.   From the record, click the link in the SLA field.   In the upper-right corner of the pop-up window, click Add SLA Instance.   In the pop-up, select the name of the SLA and set the Active Date and click OK. The SLA will display in the SLA Instances table.   To add another SLA, click the Add SLA Instance link again and select another SLA and active date and click OK.   After adding your SLAs, click OK and you are returned to the Contact or Organization record with the SLA field populated.   Click Save or Save and Close to save the record with the SLAs applied.   For additional information, refer to the Â 'Applying SLAs' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Saving file attachments to disk;Answer ID 1945;How can I easily save file attachments from an incident so that I can update the file and reattach it to the incident?;['Answer ID 1837', 'Answer ID 5168'];  File Attachments Oracle B2C Service;" Click on the file, and select Open or Download from the ribbon at the top. To download a file attachment, right-click on the file attachment and select Download. The Internet Explorer download module is invoked, which allows you to either Open or Save the file. Click Save and specify where you would like the attachment saved. Different file types may be handled differently, depending upon the Windows file types configuration settings or the source applicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own preferences as configured on your machine. If you wish to be given the option to download a particular file type every time, instead of having it automatically open in Internet Explorer, you will need to change the file type settings or the source applicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preferences accordingly. Below are some examples of how this is done, featuring the most common file types:   Microsoft Office -- .doc, .xls, .ppt: When you attempt to access a Microsoft Office file, such as a Microsoft Word or Excel document, the file may open in Internet Explorer, instead of the appropriate Office program. This occurs because Internet Explorer is configured by default to host documents for Office programs that are installed on the computer. To resolve this issue, follow the steps below. If you wish to be given the option to save the files to your desktop or to open MS Office files in the application, instead of automatically opening them in IE, use the My Computer &gt; Folder Options settings:  Â  On your desktop, open My Computer. On the Tools menu (or the View menu), click Folder Options (or click Options). Click the File Types tab. In the Registered file types list, click the specific Office document type and then click Advanced (or click Edit). In the Edit File Type dialog box, click to clear the Browse in same window check box (or click to clear the Open Web documents in place check box). Click OK.  Â  Note: If you are running on Windows NT 4.0 or 2000, you may not be able to use these steps to configure Internet Explorer to open Office files in the appropriate program. If you are running Windows, the only way to resolve this issue is to modify your registry settings, as described in Method 2 of the following article at the Microsoft support site: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;162059&amp;Product=ie600. Â   Â   PDF: The Acrobat Reader application controls whether a .PDF file will automatically open in the I.E. browser plug-in, or if you will instead be given the option to Save. To verify this setting, open Acrobat Reader and go to Edit &gt; PreferencesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ &gt; Options. If the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Display PDF in BrowserÃ¢â‚¬Â option is selected, an attempt to access an attached PDF file will automatically open in the Acrobat plug-in within the application. If it is deselected, an attempt to access an attached PDF file will prompt you to choose whether to Open or to Save the file. Â   Â   BMP: In a standard configuration, attempting to access a .BMP file should consistently present the Open or Save options. When you click Save, the file appears to open in MS Paint. Â   Â   ZIP: Accessing .ZIP files should always present the option to Save or Open. If it does not, open your ZIP extraction program and look for the appropriate web browser settings. Â   Â   EXE: Microsoft has stated that Internet Explorer will always give you the option to Save or Open when you attempt to access an .EXE file. The browser will never open an .EXE file automatically, for security reasons. Â   Â   TXT, JPG and GIF: Generally, Internet Explorer will open a .TXT, .JPG, or .GIF file within the browser without presenting the Save option. Once open, you can easily save the file opened in I.E. by simply going to File &gt; Save As. Â  Â  "

Indexing file attachments for end-user searching;Answer ID 1948;Are file attachments indexed for searching on the end-user pages?;['Answer ID 1771'];   File attachments, Indexing;  File attachments used with answers can be indexed so that searches will be compared to both the content of the answer itself and the file attachment(s). While it is possible to index attachments on answers, it is not possible to index attachments on incidents. Enabling file attachments for indexing: Â Files are not automatically indexed when it is attached to an answer or meta-answer. To enable a file attachment for indexing with an answer, right click on the file attachment and select Properties. Then, check the Indexed check box. Click OK and then save the answer.  Â  Special considerations: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Â  Each answer can have 750 keywords and phrases indexed when the answer is saved. Â  Keywords and phrases are indexed in the following order for each answer: Keywords Products Categories Summary Question Answer File Attachments Therefore, if you hit your 750 word/phrase limit in the preceding fields, the file attachments will not be indexed even if you have enabled them for indexing. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Â  When file attachments (or parts of file attachments) are indexed, the phrases receive the weighting factor specified in the SRCH_ATTACH_WEIGHT configuration setting. By default, this weighting is the same as the weighting factor for content in the Answer field. For more information on the SRCH_ATTACH_WEIGHT setting, refer to Answer ID 1771: Affecting the Weight Used with Search Results. If you determine that the answer with the file attachments is typically low within your search results, consider adding keywords and phrases to the Keywords field in order to give the answer a higher weight when the search is performed. If adding multiple words or phrases, be sure to separate each item with a comma. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Â  Attachments must have real text and not be part of images. For example, if you are trying to index the text of a PDF, open the PDF up first and perform a search of the text you expect to be indexed. If searching in the actual PDF or file does not return any results, it may be because the text is not actually text but part of an image which cannot be indexed.  Multiple file attachments: If you have multiple files attached to an answer, any remaining phrases that can be indexed of the 750 are equally distributed among the file attachments. This allows each attachment to be indexed at least a little bit, instead of biasing it to the one that is first in the list. That is, if you have two file attachments and have 100 phrases left after the answer fields are indexed, 50 keywords and phrases are dedicated to attachment 1 and 50 are dedicated to attachment 2. If you had 100 phrases left and 4 attachments, 25 phrases would be allocated to each attachment.

Mass editing hyperlinks in answers;Answer ID 1950;How can I mass update our hyperlinks in answers?;['Answer ID 415'];Answers, Variables; If you use the same URL and hyperlink in several answers, you can define an answer variable for that specific hyperlink. Then, instead of adding the same hyperlink over and over throughout your answers, add the answer variable to the content of your answers. Then, when you need to update the URL in the link, you can edit the answer variable. The change to the answer variable will take effect in all answers where that variable is used. The change will take effect when the answer variable is saved. There is no need to edit or update the answers that include the variable. Note Within a specific interface, each unique URL would need a separate answer variable defined. If your site has multiple interfaces, you can define a single answer variable and then modify the specific content that displays for each interface separately for that variable. That is, the content for interface A can be different than the content for interface B. For more information on creating answer variables, refer to Answer ID 415: Creating and Using Answer Variables.  Â

When copying a report, I cannot change the result grouping or ordering;Answer ID 1951;Why are the Result Grouping or Result Ordering options grayed out on a copy of a canned report?;['Answer ID 415'];   Analytics  Issue   When I try to change the Result Grouping or Result Ordering on the copy of a canned report, the options are grayed-out and I am unable to make the change.;  You Â can copy the standard reports in your application. This allows you to modify the copy of the report and customize it as you need to. When you copy a report that includes the date grouping function, the copy of the report has the Result Grouping and Data Sorting features disabled.  The date grouping feature is listed as a drilldown filter to access the lower level of the report. The drilldown filter is of the form date_group(fieldname, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ$date_grp_paramÃ¢â‚¬â„¢).  Â  To access the filter, Â change the Level menu to the appropriate level of the report and from the Level tab, review the Drilldown Settings. To modify the filter, from the Level tab, click Edit.  Â  Â  Â  Â   Many standard reports use Â the date grouping feature. When the date grouping option is used Â as an output column, the report Â also includes a run-time filter so that the user can specify the time units to use for grouping the result data. For example, when date grouping is used, the person generating the report can set the Date Grouping filter to be Year/Month, Year/Month/Day, or Day of Week among many other time-related intervals. When the $date_grp_param Â function is used, that output column must be the last item in the Result Grouping and Â Sort (Result Ordering) sections. In order to prevent problems from occurring, when you copy a standard report, the Result Grouping and data sorting and ordering sections are disabled (grayed-out) such that you cannot change the order of these options. Customizing the date grouping default: Â   Open the report for editing. Â  From the Report Outline, Â right click on the $date_grp_param in the Output Variables section. In the pop-up window, change the default field to be the time period of interest when running the report. Â  Â  Â   Sorting output of the report: If you want to change the default ordering of the report results, you must first remove the date grouping feature. You can then replace it with other formatting. If you would like to keep the date grouping functionality so that the Date Grouping menu is still available, you can generate the report as it is configured (with the grouping and sorting options grayed out). Then, when viewing the results, Â right click and select Sort and you can specify which field to sort the data by.

Creating a contact list or a segment for a mailing or survey;Answer ID 1954;How do I create a segment or a contact listÃ‚Â from myÃ‚Â mailing?;['Answer ID 1927', 'Answer ID 5612', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Outreach and Feedback, Contact List;"  In Â Outreach and Â Feedback, you can create two types of audiences: a contact list which includes specific contacts you identify and remains static over time or a segment which is dynamically generated each time you send a mailing to that audience. Segments and contact lists are used when sending mailings or when sending surveys. If you send a mailing/survey to multiple lists or segments and a contact record is listed more than once, i.e. the contact is included in multiple lists or segments that you are sending a single mailing to, the contact will receive only one copy of the mailing. The contact will not receive multiple mailings if they are included in multiple segments or lists. The global opt-in is not included automatically when defining a list or segment. However, when you create a mailing or survey, the Audience tab defaults to honor the global opt-in so that the mailing is sent only to contacts whose global opt-in field is set to Yes or if the field is null. Â  With this default audience, only contacts whose records have the global opt-in set to No are excluded from receiving the mailing. Â  Therefore, you do not need to explicitly include a filter to exclude contacts with the global opt-in field set to No. For more information on lists and segments, refer to Answer ID 1927: Differences between contact lists and segments in Outreach.  To define a contact Â list from within Â a mailing or survey use the steps below:  From the Audience tab of a mailing or survey, click the Add Â Contact List Â link. The Select Â Contact List Â window opens.   Click the New Contact List link.   On the Contacts tab, click the Add drop-down menu and select either Add New or Add Exiting Â to add a new contact record or to search existing records for a specific contact. Â    If you want to allow your list to receive proofs of your mailings, enable the Available for Proof checkbox.   Click Â Save &amp; Close. Â     To remove a contact from a list, open the list and click the Remove link in the Action column or right click and select Remove.  To define a segment from within a mailing or survey use the steps below:  From the Audience tab of a mailing or survey, click the Â Add Segment link. The Select Segment window opens.   Click the New Â Segment link.   Drag and drop a column name from the Fields section to the center of the Criteria tab. Â The Edit Filter window opens.   Define the name, expression, and value fields for the filter. Click the OK button to close the window.   Drag and drop additional Â column fields Â if necessary.   Click Save Â &amp; Close.  Note: To include an OR join between filters, select Add OR Node from the Actions menu. Â  Â To view the logical expression used with your segment, in the Actions section, click View Text Definition. You can preview part or all of your segment by clicking the Preview tab and selecting from the three options listed: View Top Contacts, View Random Contacts, or View All Contacts. To refresh the audience count, click Refresh in the Count section. It is also worth noting that, while there is not a technical limit of Â how many mailings can be sent, there are logical limits in how segments are built to help avoid max join errors. Building segments is similar to creating a custom report. Â  Please refer to Answer ID 5612: Best practices for table joins in Analytics Â for recommendations. For additional information, refer to the 'Add Contact List' Â and Â 'Create Segments' Â sections in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Staff accounts are not displaying in the Staff table;Answer ID 1963;How can I access staff accounts that are missing from the Staff Accounts table?;['Answer ID 585', 'Answer ID 768', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Staff Accounts in Oracle B2C Service; When working with staff accounts, by default, accounts that are disabled do not display initially in the accounts listed in the left frame of the page. When viewing staff accounts, there is an option to either display or hide disabled accounts. To see the disabled accounts: in the left-frame where the groups are listed, right click in an open area and select Show Disabled. Then, if you wish to hide them again, you can right click and select Hide Disabled. Similarly, you can select options to expand the entire list of staff accounts or collapse the entire list of accounts. This feature is useful for applications that may have several staff accounts that have been disabled for some reason. This allows administrators to most easily access only those accounts that are enabled.

Searching a non-English interface does not return answers that should match;Answer ID 1964;Why doesn't the search return all of the answers that contain that word in a non-English interface?;['Answer ID 585', 'Answer ID 768', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Phrase Searching, Language Interfaces Issue  When searching for an answer on our non-English interface, we do not always get answers returned that include the specific word we are searching for. That is, I can search for a specific word that I know is in an answer, but that answer is not included in the search results.; Word stemming is applied differently in different languages, word stemming is applied to an answer depending on the language of the answer. Word stemming is applied to search terms based on the language of the interface you are running the report in. For example, Ã¢â‚¬Å“morgenÃ¢â‚¬Â would be stemmed differently in a Dutch answer than an English answer. If you searched in an English interface for Ã¢â‚¬Å“morgenÃ¢â‚¬Â the stem of your search term is calculated in English. Then when it is compared to the stem of the answerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words, it only matched the English answerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stem, because the Dutch answerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stem is different. Similarly, when searching in the Dutch interface, your search terms are stemmed into Dutch. Only the Dutch stemmed answer will match your search, because your search is also stemmed in Dutch. Â  Note: Occasionally a word may be stemmed the same in two languages. For example in English and Dutch, the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“violetÃ¢â‚¬Â is stemmed the same. Therefore a search from an English interface for the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“violetÃ¢â‚¬Â may return Dutch answers and a search from a Dutch interface for Ã¢â‚¬Å“violetÃ¢â‚¬Â may return English answers. This is only a coincidence, however and most of the time searching for words will only return answers that are in the same language as the interface you are searching from. When using a report to search for answers by keyword, your report will only return answers that are stemmed the same as your search term. The stemming of the search term is determined by the interface you are running the report from, and the stemming of the answer is determined by the language of the answer. Therefore, when searching for Answers by keyword, you should run the report from an interface in the same language as the desired answers. You cannot build a report to search for answers from all languages based on keyword, since the search term will be stemmed to the language of the interface you are running the report from and may not match the same term stemmed in different languages.

Adding an Unsubscribe link;Answer ID 1966;How do I create an Unsubscribe link to use with our mailings?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Feedback, Surveys Oracle B2C Service;  In a mailed document, unsubscribe links allow your contacts to opt out of future emails. You can create an unsubscribe link that sets the global opt-in field or a custom opt-in field. When contacts click an unsubscribe link in an email, a page opens asking them to confirm whether they want to unsubscribe. When you set up the link, you can choose to set the opt-in field to No either before or after contacts confirm through the Unsubscribe page.  Note: When mailing documents, the staff member must include appropriate opt-in filters for the audience segment used with that mailing. Â The application defaults to take into account the global opt-in field.  To insert an unsubscribe link in a document, use the steps below:  Open the document for editing. Â    On the HTML or Text tabs, Â from the Toolbox, click the Unsubscribe Link option. Â  Â    In the pop-up window, set which opt-in field the link is associated with -- either the global opt-in or a custom opt-in field. Â    Set the Mode field. You can either prompt the user and then set the field or set the field first, and then prompt the user. Â    Enter the text to use for the link in the Text field. Â    If you wish, specify a class, style, and target for the link. Â    Click OK.

Using the Percent to Mail feature with surveys;Answer ID 1970;What span of time is used from which 5% of the incidents have a survey sent?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Surveys, Audiences Oracle B2C Service;  When Â launching a survey, you can limit the delivery of the survey to be a subset of the overall audience.  From Â the Audiences tab, you can enable the Limit Delivery to a Randomly Selected Subset of the Audience checkbox and then set the Â percentage field to a value from 1 to 99%.  Â   When you select an option less than 100%, a random number generator is used to determine whether the survey will be sent to the recipient. The random number generator returns a send or no-send signal based on the specified percentage for each email address in the list (for on-demand surveys) or for each trigger email received (for closed-incident surveys). For example, if a list of 100 email addresses is used for a Â broadcast survey with a percent to mail of 10%, the random generator determines whether or not a survey will be sent for each address. In effect, there is only a 10% chance that a survey will be sent to any single email address. Of the 100 email addresses used, approximately 10 will actually be sent surveys. The Percent to Mail feature works the same whether you are working with either transactional or broadcast surveys. As applied to transactional surveys, a random number generator returns a send or no-send signal based on the specified percentage for each survey to be sent.

Some reference numbers are off by a day in our system;Answer ID 1971;We have noticed that some incidents have a reference number that is a day ahead of the actual date that they are submitted.;['Answer ID 5168'];   Incidents, Interfaces, Time zones Oracle B2C Service;  It is possible for incidents to be created with a reference number that indicates the next day. For example, an incident might be submitted on October 3, 2018 Â and the reference number begins with Â 181004 instead of 181003. This can occur in applications that have multiple interfaces that use different time zones for each interface. If an incident has been submitted from an interface that has already begun the next calendar day, the reference number for that incident will reflect the date of that interface. Similarly, Â this will happen if an agent's staff account has the Time Zone field set Â and that agent submits an incident when the next calendar day has started for that timezone.  Â This is because the reference number field is affected for the entire database, not for each individual interface. The reference number of each incident submitted after that will reflect that next day, regardless of which interface the incident was submitted from. Once the first part of the reference number has increased, all following incidents will reflect that date. As a result, each incident submitted, regardless of interface, will reflect the new date in the reference number. For example, a database has two interfaces, one that is set for the eastern U.S time zone and one set for the western U.S. time zone (three hours difference). If an end-user submits an incident at just after midnight on February, 2, 2018, from the eastern U.S. interface, the reference number created will be 180202-000000. In the western U.S., it is only 9:00 p.m. on February 1. All incidents submitted from the western interface for the next three hours will have a reference number that begins with 180202, even though the calendar date in that area is still February 1. This is due to the incident submitted from the eastern interface. Note: The actual date and time stamps in the discussion thread are all correct according to the specific time zone configurations of each interface. In addition, the incident creation date is stored using the time for the interface through which the incident was submitted. It is only the reference number that may have cases where the reference reflects a different date than the date the incident was created.

Â  Enable the check box next to either, or both, of these options and click OK. 2. Next, enable the Send on Save check box.      3. Click the CC or BCC button to open a window that lists all available accounts, staff groups, distribution lists or other addresses within the application. You can also type the email address directly into the field. Â  A semicolon is the default delimiter Â used Â for Â multiple addresses. NOTE: These fields are a one-time copy of the incident response. Addresses included for a specific sent response do not automatically receive additional responses.  Alternateemail custom field: Alternatively, you can include a specific custom field named Alternateemail that does retain addresses to be copied (not blind copied) Â on all responses sent for the incident. The custom field can also be enabled to display on the end-user pages. If Â you add the Alternateemail custom field, an administrator must add the field to the appropriate incident workspaces used by your staff members. The custom field is not automatically added to the incident workspaces. For more information on configuring the alternateemail custom Â field Â (CC:) option, refer to Answer ID 17: Sending incident responses to more than one email address.

Difference between searching on Subject or Summary/Thread;Answer ID 1974;What is the difference between searching on Subject or Summary/Thread?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Thread phrase searching Oracle B2C Service;" There are differences in phrase searching for the Subject and Summary/Thread options when used to search for incidents from the administration consoles. Both the Subject and Summary/Thread fields from the incidents table Â can be added as run-time filters in a report or view to allow staff to search for incidents. Due to the different nature of the searches used with these fields, incidents are much more likely to be returned if you search Â using the Summary/Thread field than if you search Â using the Subject field. When searching by Subject: Searches on the Subject field do not automatically include a wild card before or after the word or phrase you are searching for -- regardless of the operator used in the filter. As a result, searches on a specific word only returns incidents with the keyword matching the first word of the subject. When searching by the Subject field, you can manually add a wild card (*) before and after your word. For example, to search for an incident with ""apple"" in the Subject line, enter *apple*. If you are searching for Subjects that include two words that are not sequential, include a wildcard between each word, such as *apple*banana*. Searches on the Subject field are not case sensitive, so searching on *apple* and *Apple* and *APPLE* all give the same results. When using the Subject field as a filter in a view, consider Â including a wildcard (*) both before and after your search string or before and after each word. The only time you do not need a wild card is if you are searching for the word at the beginning of the subject line. Â  When searching with Â the Summary/Thread: By default, searches using the Summary/Thread Â use the complex expression method of searching. Complex expressions include wildcards around the word or phrase, word-stemming, and the use of logical operators. This method searches the incident phrases table and does not search a specific field in a database table such as the Subject field. Note: Â System reports that include the Summary/Thread (incidents.search_thread) Â field use an operator of complex expression in the filter. Searching the Summary/Thread is the recommended default search method when searching incidents since it includes a search of the content of both the Subject field and discussion thread. As a result, when you search for incidents by searching for a word or phrase in the Summary/Thread, incidents are returned regardless of case and where the word is located. That is, there is an assumed wild card preceding the word or phrase. Searching the Summary/Thread uses the words stored as phrases for that incident. This search option ignores case sensitivity, plurals, verb tenses and other word endings. For example, searching on ""WALK"" returns incidents containing any of the words ""walk"", ""walked"", "" Walking"", ""walker"", and ""Walks""."

Accessing discarded email messages;Answer ID 1976;;['Answer ID 2100'];   Mailboxes, E-mail Inbound, Techmail;"  Oracle B2C Service Â does not save customer email messages. Â  As emails are processed by the techmail utility, they are permanently deleted from the mailbox. Â  This includes emails that are rejected and are not turned into incidents. Note: For more information on why email messages Â may be Â rejected, refer to Answer ID 2100: Some email messages are not being turned into incidents.  Even though messages are rejected from becoming incidents, you can receive a forwarded copy of these discarded emails. Â When configuring Â a mailbox in your site, the Send Rejected Messages To field Â allows you to specify an email address Â where to send a copy of discarded messages for that mailbox. Â  The value in Â the Send Rejected Messages To Â field must be a valid email address. Â  An original copy of all messages discarded by the application will be forwarded to this email address. If this field is null, the rejected messages are simply discarded and are not forwarded at all.  Restrictions on email addresses allowed in field: Â  The address entered in Â the Send Rejected Messages To Â field cannot be the reply-to address, From address, or Â POP account that is configured in ANY mailbox on your site. Â  You cannot forward the discarded emails to another configured mailbox on your site for processing. Â  The address that you put into this field must be a non-Oracle hosted email address. Â  Hosted mailboxes are only accessed by the techmail utility. A different address can be used for each mailbox, or interface, or the same address for all mailboxes. Â  The number of discarded messages and types may determine the desired number of Reject addresses as well as specific business practices. Â  There is no specific recommendation on how many different Â email addresses Â to use for multiple mailboxes. Â  To configure your mailbox to send rejected messages to a mailbox:  From the Configuration items, select Â Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes &gt; Service Mailboxes. For an Outreach mailbox, select Â Configuration items Â &gt; Â Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes &gt; Â Outreach Mailboxes.   In the left frame, click on the mailbox to Open and Edit.   Click the Incoming Email button located on the ribbon.   Enter a valid email address in the Send Rejected Messages To field.   Click Save.  Repeat these steps for other mailboxes in your site and for other interfaces in your site."

Pull policy, pull limit, and inbox limit used with staff profiles;Answer ID 1977;When editing aÃ‚Â profile, what are the pull policy, pull limit, and inbox limit?;['Answer ID 2215', 'Answer ID 8179', 'Answer ID 8178', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Profiles, Chat Queues;  When you have one or more queues defined for use with incidents, the Service tab in a profile includes several additional fields, namely: Queue, Pull Policy, Pull Limit, and Inbox Limit. These fields allow you to define a pull policy for your staff members that allows agents to pull unresolved, unassigned Â incidents from specific queues to be assigned to them. When a pull policy is defined in the staff profile, a Fill Inbox option displays for the staff members using that profile. Â  The Fill Inbox button displays on the Home tab for an incident report generated within the console. The Fill Inbox button does not display on the Incident tab of another record, for example, opening a contact record and clicking the Incidents tab. Â   Â  The fields that affect the pull policy are defined below:        Incident Queues: This table defines which queues the staff member can pull incidents from. Only incidents that are not assigned to a staff member and that have an unresolved status type can be pulled into a staff member's incident inbox. You can include multiple queues from which staff members can pull incidents. Â              Pull Policy: This field specifies the priority for pulling incidents from the Incident Queues above. You can set the pull policy to be Strict Priority, First Due, or Manual.     Strict priority: The strict priority pull policy uses the order of the queues within Incident Queues to determine which queue to pull incidents from. Incidents are pulled from the first queue in the list until that queue is empty and then incidents are pulled from the next highest queue, and so on.    First due: This pull policy uses the incident's due date to determine which incidents to pull. Incidents with the earliest due dates are pulled first from all queues that are available to the agent -- even if that date and time has already passed. The queue ranking and priority do not affect this pull policy.    Due dates are set based on the system default response requirements or by response requirements set in a service level agreement (SLA) that is applied to the incident. For more information on incident due dates, refer to Answer ID 2215: How an incident's due date is calculated.    Manual: This pull policy allows agents to manually pull incidents from any queue that is available to them. Agents can specify which queue to pull from. Incidents are pulled from the selected queue by the due date.           Pull Quantity: The pull quantity defines the number of incidents that will be added to the staff member's Inbox when the agent clicks the Fill Inbox / Fill Â button. If the agent hits their Inbox Limit, no additional incidents will be pulled to exceed that limit. Â            Inbox Limit: This value specifies the maximum number of incidents with an unresolved status type that can be assigned to a staff member. This includes incidents that are assigned to the Unresolved and Updated statuses as well as incidents that are assigned to a custom status that has an Unresolved status type. Â     The 'Inbox Limit' field within an Account Profile only controls the 'Fill Inbox' functionality, and does not control incidents from appearing in an Agents queue if they are updated or if they are manually assigned to that Agent.    For example, an Agent could have their 'Inbox Limit' set to 5, but have 20 incidents out which are currently assigned to said Agent and waiting on a customer response. Â  Â If all 20 of those customers update their incidents at once, the incidents will still appear in the Agents Inbox, because they have already been assigned to that Agent.    In addition, it is still possible to manually assign an incident to an Agent even if the Agent has 5 or more incidents currently in their inbox. Â  Â The 'Inbox Limit' field only controls the Agent's ability to fill their own inbox, and will not allow them to pull any more incidents themselves by clicking on the 'Fill Inbox' button if their inbox already contains the number of incidents which has been set in the 'Inbox Limit' field.

Troubleshooting Pass-Through Authentication (PTA);Answer ID 1978;;['Answer ID 2718'];   Pass-Through Authentication (PTA);"  Pass-Through Authentication (PTA) is designed to be a transparent login integration between the Â Oracle end-user pages and the site from which the end-user is Â accessing your Â Oracle B2C Service Â site (such as another login portal). Â  Â  If Â PTA fails to validate the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s login information, no error is thrown. The Â Oracle B2C Service Â application simply redirects the user to the value stored in the PTA_EXTERNAL_LOGIN_URL configuration setting. To determine why the PTA URL failed to properly validate the end-user and login the user into the knowledge base, Â use the steps below:  Locate the PTA URL for the end-user who is having problems. Â  Â Many times you can find this by right clicking on the link in which the end-user would click on to view the knowledge base and selecting copy shortcut or copy link. Â    Find and remove the p_li parameter from the URL and grab the PTA string. Â  Â This will generally be all the data in the URL after you see Ã¢â‚¬Ëœp_li=Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Â    Paste the PTA string into a base64 decoder and decode the string. Â (Note: This will only work with a non-encrypted string. If using an encrypted string, a decrypting tool must be used instead.)   Now that you can see what information the PTA string contains, review the following items for the issue occuring with your site.  Item 1: Is the user name and password correct for the contact record stored in the Oracle B2C Service database?  Login into the administrative console and locate the contact record based on the email address found in the PTA string above.   Compare the login to the p_userid value. These values must match (case-sensitive) in order for PTA to properly validate the user.   If these values do not match please update and save the contact record.  The password field cannot be added within the contact workspace. Â  Â See Â Answer ID 2718: Contact Password Encryption in February 2009 for more information. Â  Customers using pass-through authentication (PTA) will need to use the Data Import Wizard Â if updates to Â contact passwords are needed.  Item 2: Â Does the p_li_passwd parameter appear in the PTA string? The value passed in the p_li_passwd parameter must match the value stored in the PTA_SECRET_KEY configuration setting. Login into the administrative console and locate the PTA_SECRET_KEY. Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  Item 3: Does the p_li_expiry parameter appear in the PTA string? The value passed in the p_li_expiry parameter causes the PTA string to become invalid at the date and time specified in the UNIX timestamp value. NOTE: The value for this parameter needs to be in UNIX time. To investigate this:  Convert the UNIX timestamp to conventional date and time. Â    Make sure this is set to a time that Â is in the future from the point in time the login attempt Â is made. Â  Â If the Â parameter Â is set in the past, the PTA string immediately becomes invalid."

Excluding parts of an answer from being indexed;Answer ID 1985;;['Answer ID 1309'];  Answers;" For any answer, you can exclude specific Â content from being indexed. This allows you to prevent certain words or phrases from being indexed, or searched on, Â for that answer. As a result, the answer is not returned when a search is performed on content that is excluded from indexing. Â  This approach allows you to more directly impact which answers are Â returned for specific searches. Â  By Â excluding specific answers from being returned for specific search terms and phrases, your site visitors can more easily find answers for a specific search term.  Stopindex and Startindex Tags To exclude specific words or sections of answer content from being indexed, you can use special HTML tags designed specifically for use with answers. When Â  &lt;!--stopindex--&gt;  Â and &lt;!--startindex--&gt;  Â tags surround content in an answer, Â that content is excluded from being indexed. These tags can be added to the following fields in an answer: Keywords Question Answer The &lt;!--stopindex--&gt; and &lt;!--startindex--&gt; tags must be manually added to the appropriate field. Â  When adding these tags to the Question or Answer field, add the field in Source mode. Click Â the Source tab to add the tags within Â the source code. You can add multiple sets of these tags within a single answer if you determine that there are separate words or blocks of content to exclude from indexing. Examples: Â  Within Â the Answer field, in Source mode, you could add tags as follows to exclude content: Within this sentence, there are &lt;!--stopindex--&gt; specific words &lt;!--startindex--&gt; to exclude from searching. In this case, ""specific"" and ""words"" are not indexed when the answer is saved. Â  Other words in the sentence are eligible for being indexed. Â  Note that if ""specific"" and ""words"" is included in another field, another sentence Â or in a file attachment, they may be indexed due to the additional occurrence within the answer. You can also exclude an entire paragraph or paragraphs from being indexed: &lt;!--stopindex--&gt; This entire paragraph is excluded from being indexed. The paragraph could be several sentences long. &lt;!--startindex--&gt;  Global Exclusion of Search Terms You can exclude specific words from being indexed in any answer by adding them to the exclude_answers.txt  Â file. Â  This file contains common words such as prepositions, adverbs, and pronouns that are excluded from indexing and searching functions on the customer portal. If you have specific words that you do not want customers to be able to search on, you can add these stopwords to the exclude_answers.txt file to exclude them from being indesed. Stopwords must be uppercase and typed on separate lines. Note: Words in this file are also excluded when using SmartAssistant to search for an answer. For more information on excluding words globally, refer to Answer ID 1309: Excluding specific words or phrases from searching."

Merging contact records;Answer ID 1988;;['Answer ID 2083'];  Contacts, All versions Issue  In some cases, people have multiple contact records with different email addresses for each record. We want to combine or merge these contact records into a single record, butÃ‚Â both of them each have incidents associated with them. What's the best way to proceed?;" To combine multiple contact records, you must first re-associate each incident to be with one of the records. If Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service is enabled, then all sales opportunities should also be associated with one of the records. Then, you can update that record accordingly and you can remove or disable the obsolete contact record. For example, if you have the two records below: Jim Smith: wrongemail@mycompany.com with 15 incidents Jim Smith: jim.smith@mycompany.com with 3 incidents In this case, you would first reassociate the 3 incidents to be with the top record -- even if the correct email address is the email from the second record. (Note: If you know which one the customer uses most often or which is the correct one, move all records to that contact record.) Â  You would then edit the second record and change the email address to something different (i.e. append "".invalid"" to the address) and then update the first record to change the email address to be jim.smith@mycompany.com. You may want to update both email and login fields accordingly. Â  As a result, you will end up with the records below: Jim Smith: jim.smith@mycompany.com with 18 incidents Jim Smith: jim.smith@mycompany.com.invalid with 0 incidents Similarly, you need to evaluate sales Â opportunities that are associated to the records and reassociate the sales opportunities to a single record. Once you have reassociated the incidents and any sales opportunities, you can delete the second record. When deleting the record, be sure you are deleting the record that has 0 incidents. If the email address is used in the Login field and you modified the email address of the record, contact the end-user for that record to determine if they wish to update the Login field to match the updated email address. Note: If Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service is enabled, you cannot merge marketing activity for the two records. Â  Marketing information for the non-primary record is lost. Below are example steps to use to merge incidents into one contact record: Determine which record has more incidents. This is the primary record and will be the record that remains after the merge is complete. If the records have about the same number of incidents, determine which of the records you want to keep as the primary. Â   Â  Search for all incidents associated with the non-primary contact record so that all of the incidents display in one view. Â   Â  Change the contact association for each incident associated to the non-primary record. Â  Â  You can add the Contact ID Â relationship item to the multi-edit incident workspace and then multi-edit the incidents to reassociate them to the primary contact record. Or you can Â open each incident and click the magnifying glass to the right of the Contact ID field. Â  In the pop-up window, search for the primary contact record, Â click Select, and save the incident. You can open the non-primary contact record and click the Incidents tab to access each incident to be reassociated to the primary record. Â  After editing each incident, be sure you save the non-primary record. When opening and editing a child record, edits are only saved when the parent record is also saved. Therefore, you must save the non-primary contact record Â so that your edits to the children records (the incidents) are also saved. Â  If both of the contact records are associated with the same organization, you can change the association by clicking the Organization tab and then checking the radio button in the Contacts section for the primary contact. This will set the incident so that the contact you select is the primary association for that incident. Â   Â  If Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service is enabled, repeat these steps to find and reassociate sales opportunities so that they are all listed under the primary contact. Â   Â  Once all incidents and sales opportunities Â have been re-associated with the primary contact record, the non-primary record will have zero incidents associated with it. At this point, you can delete the non-primary record. It may be necessary to edit the primary record so that it has the correct email address or alternate email address. Important! When deleting the extra contact record, make sure you are deleting the record that has no incidents or opportunities associated with it. To verify that the record has no incidents associated to it, open the contact record and click the Incidents radio button on the Contact tab to verify that there are no incidents listed. For more information on deleting contact records, refer to Answer ID 2083: Deleting a contact record but not the organization."

Deleting an incident queue;Answer ID 1989;What actions should we take when deleting an incidentÃ‚Â queue?;['Answer ID 2260'];  Site Administration, Queues Oracle B2C Service;" If you determine that your business process no longer needs to use an incident queue that already exists in your RightNow application, review the actions below in order to remove the queue successfully from your system. It is not possible to merely disable an existing queue from being assigned incidents. Â Queues configured in your application can be assigned incidents manually by staff members. To delete an incident queue, use the Â process below: Â  Edit incident rules: Review your incident rules and edit or remove any rules that assign incidents to the queue. Be sure to activate the ruleset after you have modified the appropriate rules.  Â  Reassign incidents assigned to that queue: If there are any incidents assigned to the queue that is to be deleted, consider reassigning those incidents to a more appropriate queue. When you delete the queue, all incident assigned to that queue are set to ""No Value"". If you have several other incidents that are not associated with a queue and set as No Value, you will not be able to easily distinguish which incidents were associated with the deleted queue from incidents that were already set to No Value. Therefore, after deleting the queue, it may be more difficult to reorganize your incidents if necessary.  Â  Edit views and reports to remove filters specific to that queue: You cannot delete the queue without first removing all view and report dependency conflicts. To determine which view and reports include filters need to be changed, try deleting the queue and if a dependency window pops up, note of all views and reports listed and edit them to remove the dependency. After the queue is deselected or the filter is completely removed from all the reported views and reports, you should have no further issues removing the queue. For more information on dependency issues, refer to Answer ID 2260: Resolving Dependency Conflicts.  After evaluating your rules, incidents, views and reports, use the steps below to delete the queue: From Configuration, select Application Appearance &gt; Customizable Menus &gt; Incident Queues.  Â  Click on the queue name and Â click the Delete button on the ribbon.  "

Activating rules gives message about records with null state;Answer ID 1994;;['Answer ID 2260'];   Business Rules  Issue   Error Message: State Values Move the 52 records in state with id value of NULL to:Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  NULLÃ‚Â ;  When implementing a new ruleset, you may already have records in your database for that record type. Records that exist prior to implementing rules have a NULL rule state associated with them. Â  Records can also have a null rule state if they were imported or created from an integration and the integration does not set a rule state. In general, when a ruleset is activated, it is best that records in your site are associated with one of the rule states. Records with a null rule state are never compared to the rules and are never acted on by the ruleset. Â  As a result, you may expect certain actions to occur when a record is saved due to the rules, but if that record has a null rule state, those actions do not occur. Â  This obviously can cause confusion and unexpected results.  When you compile or activate a ruleset, the application checks to see if there are existing records that have a Null rule state. Â  If so, you receive the following message:  There are records in the database that need to be modified for the rulebase being activated. Â   When you click OK, you receive the message:  State Values Move the Â X Â records in state with id value of NULL to ____  The menu field lists the rule states along with a NULL option. Â   If you leave the menu field Â set to NULL, then the Â records will remain without a rule state in your site. Â  As a result, when those records are edited or updated, they Â  are not acted upon by the rules.   If you set the menu field to one of the rule states included in the rule set, that rule state becomes assigned to those records. Â  Then, when the record is edited and saved, it is compared to the rules associated with the rule state.  Note: Activating the ruleset and assigning a rule state Â does not trigger the rules to fire against the records in your site. This merely assigns the rule state to the records. The record must be updated and saved in order for the rules to act upon the record.  When determining which rule state to assign to the NULL records, in most cases, you will select a non-initial rule state. Â  That is, you are most likely to select the rule state used Â that acts on your existing records. Â  If you assign the records to your initial rule state, when the record is updated, it will be routed and handled as though it were a new record in your site.  For example: Â  You are interested in creating opportunity rules and you already have 100 opportunities in your site. Â  These Â opportunities have a null rule state since opportunity rules are not yet implemented in your site. As part of your ruleset, you have created two rule states -- Initial (for new opportunities) and Â Existing. Â  When you compile or activate your opportunity rules, you will get the message:  State Values Move the Â 100 Â records in state with id value of NULL to ____  The menu field defaults to NULL and Initial and Existing are also listed in the menu. Since the opportunities already exist in your site, they should most likely be associated to the Existing rule state so that when any of them are updated, the rules in the Existing state are applied to them. Â  Therefore, set the field to Existing and click Save. Â  You will get the message indicating that the rulebase is activated. Note: When there Â are 100K or more records (i.e. incidents, contacts, organizations, opportunities, etc..) that need to be moved, contact Oracle B2C Service Technical Support to get the records moved at the Database level. Moving the records within the console Â can Â cause downtime on the site until the activation finishes.

Using a list of common aliases and keywords for all answers;Answer ID 1995;"How can I define a ""master list"" of keywords to use when searching all of my answers?";['Answer ID 2260'];"   Aliases  Issue   When I add keywords to individual answers, I find that I have to add the same group of keywords to lots of my answers in the knowledge base. It would be better to defineÃ‚Â a ""master list"" of keywords to use when searching all of my answers.";"  You can use aliases (synonyms) to enhance searching. Adding aliases lets you link terms that are specific to your industry or organization to similar terms your customers may search for. For example, a customer might search for an acronym, such as ""GPS"", but all of your answers regarding GPS might spell out the full term ""global positioning system"". Creating an alias word list lets you link these two terms and save time because you need to create this link only once instead of adding it as a keyword to multiple answers. In this example, you would add the following line to the aliases.txt file. GPS,GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM,NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM You can use the aliases.txt file to define business-specific synonyms to be used with all end-user searches performed on your answers. The aliases.txt file allows you to define a master list of synonyms to be applied to all your answers. The aliases.txt file contains no default alias terms. To use this capability, you must customize the file with the terms you want. To access the aliases.txt file, from the File Manager change the Switch To menu to be wordlist files and click the file name. By adding content to your aliases.txt file, you can effectively define synonyms used for searching. This greatly reduces the need to add similar groups of keywords to the Keywords field of several individual answers.   AND vs. OR Searching: Multiple-word aliases will not work if the Â ANS_AND_SEARCH configuration setting Â is enabled. If enabled, searches on the end-user pages are treated as Boolean ""AND"" searches. If disabled, searches on the end-user pages are treated as Boolean ""OR"" searches.  Weight Values: If you configure aliases in your aliases.txt file, the matched weights for aliases depend on the version your site is running. Aliased words are matched with the same weight as the indexed word. Â  This means that answers that match alias terms may receive a higher weight than you expect due to an alias being matched. Multiple interfaces: Â  Within the File Manager, files located in the wordlist menu are not interface specific. Each file is language specific. Â  That is, if two interfaces in your site have the same language pack applied, those interfaces share the same wordlist files. Â  As a result, when you create aliases, if your site has another interface that uses the same language pack, the aliases are defined for both interfaces. For example, if two interfaces both have the en_US language pack applied, if you add words to the aliases.txt file for one interface, those words are also aliased when searching in the other interface that uses the en_US language. Defining your aliases: When adding lines to the aliases.txt file, each line in the file is set up to mean: IF the first word in the line is used as the search word, THEN return answers containing that word or any of the other words on that line.  That is, the first word on each line of the alias file is the search word that your site visitor might search on. The additional words (in the non-first position) are the synonyms that are in your answers. Answers that include these aliases are returned when a user searches on the first word in the entry. Each line in the aliases.txt file defines the synonyms that will be returned when the user searches on the first word. This means that you must enter a separate line for EACH WORD that you want to define synonyms for.  Word stemming: Â  Word stemming is not applied automatically to the aliased word. Â  For example, if you alias ""pick"" with ""select"", the entry in the aliases.txt file is:  PICK,SELECT  If you search on ""pick"", answers with Â pick, picks, picked, and picking are returned based on the normal searching functionality. Â  In addition, due to the alias, answers that contain select, selects, selected, and selecting are also returned. However, if you search on ""picks"", only answers that share that same word stem (pick, picked, picking) are returned with the search results. Â  The alias does not apply because an alias is not defined for the specific word PICKS.  Considerations when defining aliases: When you add lines to the aliases.txt file, take into account the following:  The search term cannot contain ampersands or slashes. The search term can include hyphens. Â    All entries must be in CAPITAL LETTERS.   The first Â entry is the search Â the customer can enter, and it must be Â without ampersands, or slashes, although it may contain a hyphen. The other terms in the line can contain spaces, so you can use phrases as synonyms for the search word. Use a comma delimiter with NO SPACE between the search terms. For example: GPS,GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM,NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM If using acronyms, use all capital letters, with no periods, and a comma between the acronyms. Alias words score very highly in search results therefore answers with multiple alias words may always appear on top. The aliases.txt file is shared by all interfaces on a site with a common language.  Example 1: Within the Â Oracle B2C Service Support site, there are several answers that have ""email"" within the answer content. There are also several other answers that have ""e-mail"" in them due to menu headings or product names. To alias ""email"" and ""e-mail"", we added two lines to the aliases.txt file as depicted below, so that a user can search on either term and get all answers back that contain ""email"" or ""e-mail"". EMAIL,E-MAIL E-MAIL,EMAIL  The top entry allows users to search on ""email"" and answers that have ""e-mail"" in them are returned. Similarly, the second entry allows users to search on ""e-mail"" and all of the answers that have ""email"" in them are returned due to the aliasing. Example 2: Other aliases that we have defined for the Â Oracle B2C Service Â Support Â site is for ""meta-answers"", ""metaanswers"", and ""meta answers"". Since the published answers only include the spelling that has the hyphen (meta-answers), we only need to list that single value in the non-first position for each entry. As a result, the aliasing entries are provided below: METAANSWERS,META-ANSWERS META,META-ANSWERS  In this example, the top entry allows users to search on ""metaanswers"" as all one word and all of the answers that have the hyphenated term in them are returned with the search. In the second line, since spaces are not allowed in the first position, we chose to include the term ""meta"" as the aliasing element so that if users search on ""meta"" or ""meta answers"", all of the answers with the hyphenated terms are returned in the search results. Note: With this configuration for aliasing ""meta"" with ""meta-answers"", if someone searches on ""meta data"", all of the ""meta-answer"" answers will be returned with the search results."

State field with contact and organization records;Answer ID 1998;When adding or editing a contact or organization, what is theÃ‚Â State field?;['Answer ID 6937', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2476'];   Contacts, All versions;"  Within your Oracle B2C Service application, contact and organization records are shared across all modules enabled in your site, Oracle B2C Service, Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service, and/or Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service. Â  This allows staff to use a single record Â to view opportunity, mailing, and support activities associated with that record. The  Â State  Â field allows you to specify which Â modules of your application Â a contact or organization is associated with -- Service, Outreach, and/or Opportunities. The Â State field allows you to Â delineate different types of contact and organization records in your application based on their activity and involvement with your staff. Depending on your site configuration and your business processes, Â records may be enabled for only one of the States or they may be enabled for multiple components. For example, a sales representative in your organization might be working with a specific contact to demonstrate your products and provide sales information. This contact could be enabled with the  Â Opportunities Â state since someone from your sales department is working with them. Â This allows all staff to know that the contact or organization is a potential customer. If your marketing department is also sending marketing information to the contact such as outbound emails, newsletters, and campaigns, the contact should also have the  Â Outreach Â state enabled so that staff know that the contact receives communication from your marketing department. Â  For contacts that you are sending Marketing information, but your sales department is not actively engaged, you could set the State to have Â Outreach enabled, but Â Opportunities and Service disabled. If the contact is not involved with submitting incidents to your support department through the Service application, the contact does not need the Service state enabled. If you have designated support contacts at your customer's organization, you could enable their records so that the Service Â state is enabled. Â  Note: The state(s) selection does not affect outgoing messages to a contact (i.e. customers that do not have an Outreach state can still receive marketing messages). Â  However, it can affect how incoming emails from contacts are processed. Â  See Answer ID 6937: Assistance Request Denied email sent to customer Â for more information. Using State Fields in Reports: Â  When configuring reports, you can include a filter for each of the three States as you deem necessary. Each of the three states is a separate field (Opportunities State, Outreach State, Service State) Â that can be added independently of the others. You can also include the States in the output columns of a report. In the Expression field select the contacts or organizations table and then select Â either Outreach State, Opportunities State, or Service State from the contacts or organizations table.  Staff Profiles: Â  When configuring staff profiles, you can specify which types of contact and organization Â records (based on the State field) Â can be viewed, edited, or deleted. For contact records, you can specify which types of contact records can be moved to a different organization record. Â This allows you to protect content and restrict access for certain types of records.  From Â the Configuration items, select Staff Management &gt; Profiles, Click the Permissions button on the ribbon. Then click Â the Organization and/or Contact tab to specify which types of records can be read, edited, deleted, or moved.    Some aspects of the Â State fields work differently Â for different releases. Â For specific information, select your version and review current documentation. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Quick Search reports: The default quick search reports have no filters based on the State values. This allows sales, marketing, and support staff the ability to easily search for the contact or organization record they are interested in. You can create custom quick search reports that include the Â Opportunities State, Â Outreach State, or Service State fields as either filters or output columns in the report. For more information on customizing quick search reports, refer to Answer ID 2476: Customizing Quick Search Functionality. Default State for new records: Â The default is that all three states are selected for new contacts or organizations. Â The default state is determined by the contact or organization workspace used. Trouble finding records: Â  If you have difficulty finding records with a specific state, verify that the staff member's profile allows access to records with that state. Also check the configuration of the report used for the search to make sure there are no fixed filters on a specific state. For example, make sure that the report does not have a fixed filter for Service State equals yes."

Automatically publishing answers on a specific date;Answer ID 1999;Can I automatically publish answers on a specific date?;['Answer ID 348', 'Answer ID 2704', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answers having a private status type Oracle B2C Service,Ã‚Â All versions;  You can enable a Publish On date field Â to display when editing an answer from the administrative pages. The Publish On field allows you to specify when an answer's status should change to Public. On the date specified, the status of the answer will be automatically changed to Public by Â agedatabase from whatever other private status type it had been previously set to. The Publish On field is a date field. The answer is set to public when the agedatabase utility runs and if the publish on date has already passed. When using the Publish On date, only the answer's status will change. When you save an answer with a publish on date, set the status to a private status type. Â  Then, be sure to set Â the access level, language, products, and categories as though you were publishing the answer. That way, when the status changes to public, all the other fields are set correctly so that the answer will be visible on your end-user pages. When using the Publish On date field, it is not possible to have answers published to a custom answer status that is a public status type. The answer will be set to the system-defined Public status. In order to set the Publish On field, the staff member's profile must allow the ability for the staff member to publish answers. That is, on the Service tab of the profile, the Set to Public box must be enabled in the Answers section. Note: If an answer has the Publish On field set to a date and you wish to pull the answer from being published, edit the answer and change the status along with clearing the Publish On field value. If the Publish On field is set to any date that has already passed and the answer status type is private, then the answer status will change to Public the next time the agedatabase utility runs. For more information, refer to Answer ID 2704: Private answers publishing automatically. Adding the Publish On date field to Â agent workspace: You can add the Publish On field to an answer workspace. You can drag and drop the Â Publish On field to be included in the workspace used by your staff members. For additional information, refer to the 'Adding fields to workspaces' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Service features shared across multiple interfaces;Answer ID 2001;Which Service features are shared across multiple interfaces?;['Answer ID 1102'];   Interfaces, Customizable Menus, Application Configuration, Site Management;"  Within the Oracle B2C Service application, several features are shared across multiple interfaces while some features are always interface specific. With some features, you can configure where the item displays so that it can be enabled for use with some interfaces and not with others.  Features Common across Interfaces  The features below are always shared across interfaces. If you add an item to any of the features below, that item is visible and accessible from any other interface.        System/Custom Menus:Unless mentioned explicitly below the menus configured within Service Configuration &gt; Customizable Menus are common across all interfaces. Where appropriate, language-specific labels can be configured from any interface. The entire menu list will be displayed unless workspace rules are used to hide/show certain menu items.            Rules: For each record type, there is one ruleset that can be active at any given time. The ruleset Â acts on all records of that type across all interfaces. Â  For example, the incident ruleset acts on all incidents regardless of which interface the incident is created from.    For incident routing, you can use the interface field or the mailbox (which is interface specific) to handle incidents from a specific interface. However, the overall ruleset is shared across all interfaces. Â            Organizations and Contacts: Organization and contact records are shared across all interfaces. You can create custom fields to flag certain records as being primarily associated to a specific interface. Â              Product Linking: If product linking is enabled, it is enabled across all interfaces -- either product-category linking or product-disposition linking.       Features Never Shared across Interfaces  The features below are always configured separately for each interface. While you can configure several features to have the same value for different interfaces (such as configuration settings), they must be configured for each interface separately and do not share a joint configuration. Adding or editing an item does not affect how that feature is used in the other interfaces.        Mailboxes: Mailboxes are specific to the interface they are configured in. When you look at the mailboxes table, only the mailboxes for that interface are listed. For other interfaces, you must access the Service Mailboxes table from the Administration Console. Â            Configuration Settings, Message Bases, File Manager: Each interface can be configured independently using the configuration settings, message bases, and file manager. Changes to a setting or message base in one interface are not global in nature - with the exception of the AR_AUTO_ENABLE setting. If Â AR_AUTO_ENABLE is enabled in one interface, it will affect all interfaces.    Note: When you select Configuration &gt; Â Site Configuration and then Settings, Message Bases or File Manager, the interfaces are listed along the left frame of the configuration editor. Click the appropriate interface name to switch to the configuration files for another interface. Â            Reports: The list of reports and views that can be accessed are independent in each interface. That is, when you add a custom report or view in one interface, that report or view is not automatically listed in the other interfaces. Â     You can copy a report or view to another interface. When copying the item, set the Interface menu to specify which interface the copy will be saved to.    Note: From within a certain interface, you can configure views or reports to display data from multiple interfaces. This allows you to access records from multiple interfaces from a single location. Some records may or may not be accessible in another interface due to visibility considerations such as products, categories, and staff members. Â            End-User Pages: Since both the end-user view and configuration settings, message bases, and file manager are independent for each interface, configuring your end-user pages is specific to each interface. Â            Workspaces: The list of workspaces is unique for each interface. You can copy a workspace from one interface to another. The list of available workspaces, though, is specific to the interface. Â            Navigation Sets: Navigation sets are unique to a specific interface. Since different features may be enabled for different interfaces, you cannot copy a navigation set from one interface to another.           Surveys and Questions: Both Surveys and Questions are unique to a specific interface. When you look at the Surveys Explorer or Questions Explorer, only those configured in that interface are listed.     Configurable or Partially Shared across Interfaces  Several features share the same lists across multiple interfaces, but specific items may be enabled or disabled for specific interfaces. In these cases, an administrator can typically edit the overall list from the Management and Configuration console of any interface, but the elements that display in a console or on end-user pages can be enabled for an individual interface or multiple interface, depending on how the visibility is configured. While the feature / field can be edited and configured from any interface, specific values may or may not display at the consoles within that interface.        Staff Profiles and Staff Accounts Tables: The staff profiles and staff accounts that are configured in the Configuration &gt; Staff Management area are accessible from any interface. That is, the list of staff profiles and staff accounts are common across all interfaces.    Specific profiles may only allow access to certain interfaces so that profiles may be configured to be used specifically for individual interfaces. As a result, staff accounts may be configured to use a profile that only allows them the ability to log in to a specific interface. Â            Service Level Agreements, Response Requirements, and Holidays: The list of SLAs, response requirements, and holidays are common across all interfaces and can be accessed from any interface for editing or updating. Response requirements themselves are configured separately for each interface. Holidays may be enabled for multiple interfaces or may be added only for a specific interface.    SLAs are common across all interfaces and can be applied to any contact or organization record. Since SLAs also affect privileged access, SLAs may grant access to access levels that are only accessible through a specific interface. Â            Products and Categories: The complete products and categories tables are accessible from any interface, regardless of how individual items are configured for visibility. This allows an administrator to edit products and categories from any interface.    Each individual product or category may be enabled for Administration or End-user visibility, so the list of products and categories Â listed with incidents at the administration console Â and on the Â end-user pages may be independent or may overlap depending on how each element is configured for visibility.    If a Â product or category Â is enabled for Administration visibility for any interface, when editing an answer, Â that value Â will display for all interfaces on either the Relationships tab.    Typically, the overall list of products or categories is listed when editing answers from the administration consoles. Â  The products and categories listed on the Answers page of the end-user pages is controlled by the End-user visibility checkbox.           Standard Text: The list of standard text messages from the Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Â Standard Text Â table is common across all interfaces. Â Each Â specific standard text message Â can Â be enabled or disabled for use for a specific interface or for multiple interfaces. Â    Â  Â        Access Levels: The list of access levels from the Service Configuration &gt; Customizable Menus &gt; Answer Access Levels table is common across all interfaces. In addition, the entire list is included at the Answer Console for any interface. The end-user visibility of access levels can be enabled or disabled for each interface separately. Â    Â  Â        Custom Fields: The overall list of custom fields can be accessed and edited from any interface. However, the specific custom field may be enabled for use for a specific interface or for multiple interfaces, depending on the configuration. For more information on the visibility settings for custom field, refer to Answer ID 1102: Visibility Settings for Custom Fields."

Editing sales strategies, stages, and tasks;Answer ID 2004;How do I edit sales strategies?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Opportunity Tracker, Sales, Tasks Oracle B2C Service;"  Within Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service, you can define sales strategies for your sales representatives. A sales strategy is a sales plan that includes stages and associated tasks that must be completed in order for opportunities to move through each stage. Strategies allow you to define multiple sales plans based on your business processes and needs. Strategies help to ensure that policies and procedures are enforced. When you define a sales strategy, each strategy is allowed a set of sales stages, and each stage is allowed a set of tasks. A sales stage can be forecasted, and all opportunities in the forecasted stage will appear in the forecasting pipeline reports. Tasks can be assigned to a staff member other than the staff member assigned to the opportunity. Defining tasks, stages, and strategies allows you to track the progress of each opportunity as it moves through your system. You can add your sales strategy first and within that strategy, you add stages and tasks.  Â  To add or edit a sales strategy:  From the Configuration items, select Â Opportunity Tracking Â &gt; Strategies to access the Strategy-Edit panel. To add a strategy, click the New button on the ribbon. To edit a strategy, click the strategy in the left panel. Add the Name Â for the strategy Enable or disable the strategy for use.

Â  To add or edit a stage:  To add a stage, click the arrow on the New button and Â select Add a New Stage to the Selected Strategy. To edit a stage, click the stage. In the pop-up, enter Name Â for the stage. Check if the stage should include a forecast. All Opportunities in stages that are forecasted will appear in the Forecast Pipeline reports. If the stage is forecasted, type the forecast percent that the sales representative is expected to close for the stage. Enter descriptive notes if you wish. Click Save.  Â  To add or edit a task:  To add a task, click the arrow on the New button and select Add a New Task to the Selected Stage. To edit a task, Â click the task. Enter the Name for the task. Set the Task Interval field to the amount of time for completing the task. You can set the time units to be days, hours, or minutes. This is used to calculate the task due date when a task is assigned to an opportunity through the selection of a sales strategy and associated stages. Select a staff member to be responsible for owning the task to ensure its completion. If this field is left blank, the task gets assigned to the sales representative who is assigned to the opportunity. Enter notes if you wish. Click Save.

Adding or editing a quote template;Answer ID 2005;How do I add or edit a quote template?;['Answer ID 2030', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Quote Templates Oracle B2C Service;"  Quote templates allow your sales representatives to send standardized quotes to potential customers. The template uses merge fields that automatically populate the contents of the quote to be sent. The merge fields are the table names and column names from the Oracle B2C Service database tables. You can define which fields to included, such as organization, organization address, contacts, and sales quotes fields. Merge Fields: Â  Merge fields allow you to look up Sales contact information and insert it into the text in your quote. There are three types of merge fields; single, group and indexed.  Single - fields that have a one-to-one relationship with opportunities. For example, an opportunity can only be associated with one organization (orgs.name). Â    Groups - fields that have a many-to-one relationship with opportunities. For example, a quote can have many products (sa_prod2quotes.original_name_group). Note: A group field must be inserted into a single cell in a Word document. Word will build the table around the cell based on how many values are in the group.   Indexed - fields that have a many-to-one relationship with opportunities and are indexed in the database. For example, an opportunity can have many contacts (contacts.any_phoneN). Note: You must replace the Ã¢â‚¬Å“NÃ¢â‚¬Â with a numeric value (contacts.any_phone1). The number one is always associated with the primary field in the table.  Note: To ensure the quote template loads properly, make sure that you do not have Microsoft Word open on your machine. To add a quote template: Â   Open the Â Quote Templates item. Click the New button on the ribbon to add a new Â Quote template. Enter the name for the template. Enable or disable the template. Enable the visibility for the appropriate interface(s).

Avoiding the SSL Security Information pop-up message;Answer ID 2009;On the administration consoles, why do some users get the SSL security information pop-up message with each page turn?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Administration Console;"  Users may see a security message like the one below when working with a site that uses a secure socket layer (SSL):  Message: This site contains both secure and nonsecure items. Do you wish to display the non secure items?  This message is informing you that the site you are navigating to is a secure site. However, it will download content from a non secure site. A secure site uses a security protocol such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or PCT (Private Communications Technology) to secure the information you send and receive. Information such as your name or credit-card number, is encrypted so that it can't be read by other people. Â  The non secure items are not encrypted. Non secure items may simply be information items or they may be information gathering items. Given what you know about this website and your computer, you must decide whether to continue working with this site. If you do not feel confident about working with this site, click No. Another possible reason for seeing this message is when you use Â your own custom domain name, but have not provided Oracle B2C Service Support with Â your own digital certificate. This results in Â your site using the *.custhelp.com certificate when it should use its own. This message will typically display in the following situations:  A site utilizes SSL, but some items referenced on the site, such as images hosted on other servers, are not SSL protected. In this case, the message is indicating that not all callouts are SSL protected. The user moves from a site that uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to one that does not. If SSL is used, the URL begins with https instead of http. The additional ""s"" in the URL indicates the SSL. Therefore, the message lets the user know that they are leaving an SSL-protected site.  Users may not get the security message if they have previously clicked an option that states ""Don't warn me again..."" or ""Always trust..."" In addition, users can configure their browsers to not display these alerts. For example, in the case of mixed content messages, users can turn off the pop-up message through the path: Internet Explorer &gt; Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Security &gt; Custom Level &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Display Mixed Content and disable the setting. As a result, if the user sees the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Don't warn me againÃ¢â‚¬Â-type of option, checking this box is the easiest way to avoid multiple warning messages. If your secure site includes a redirect, you may want to verify that the redirect goes to an SSL-protected site that has a URL beginning with https."

Using Response Interval, Revalidate, and Recalculate boxes with rules;Answer ID 2015;When configuring escalation rules, when should I enable the additional options?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Business Rules, Escalations Oracle B2C Service;"  When setting up escalation rules, you must determine whether to enable the Use Response Interval, Â Revalidate and Recalculate Â checkboxes. Each of these options is described below. In general, the escalation process includes two rules. The first rule is a ""chain"" rule that specifies the criteria for escalation and determines the time frame for setting the escalation level. The second rule includes the escalation actions that acts on the record when the escalation level is set by the dbstatus utility. Within the chain rule, when you click the Add Action button and select the action Escalate, several fields display, including the Use Response Interval, Â Revalidate and Recalculate Â check boxes.  Response Interval Option  When the Use Response Interval box is checked, the time attributed to the incident is based on the response interval for the incident. The response interval is associated with either the default response requirements or with specific response requirements that are configured for a service level agreement (SLA) that is applied to the incident. That is, if your default response requirements are configured for 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, if your escalation rule is set to escalate in 4 hours and the Use Response Interval box is checked, the incident will only escalate during the hours specified in the response requirements. The incident will not escalate in the evenings or night or on weekends. The four hours must elapse during the response intervals that are configured. If you select Days as the unit for the time element, one day corresponds to 24 hours. Again, if you check the Use Response Interval box, this means that that number of hours based on the default response requirements must pass before the incident is escalated. If you use 1 Day with the User Response Interval box checked and your response requirements have 8 hours specified each day, then this corresponds to 3 work days (of eight hours each).  Revalidate Option  When the Revalidate check box is enabled, the escalation conditions are checked again when the record is saved to determine if the record still meets the criteria to be escalated. If the record has been edited so that the escalation criteria are no longer met, the scheduled escalation is cleared and the record will not be escalated, even though it initially met the original criteria. A Â record must remain in the same rule state in order for it to be revalidated. When the record is compared to the initial criteria, this includes the rule state as well. The record must also be in the same rule state as the initial rule condition. That is, a record matches a rule while it was in the initial state and the revalidate box is checked. If that record transitions to another state, the criteria are no longer met when the revalidate check is performed and the record will not be escalated. An example of revalidation: If the escalation criteria indicates that an incident must be in the Unresolved status and assigned to a specific group in order for it to be escalated, if you check the Revalidate box, the incident will have to be in the Unresolved status and still assigned to the specific group at the time it is escalated in order for the escalation rule to take effect. If the incident is assigned to another group or is assigned to a different status such as Updated or a custom status, it will no longer meet the escalation criteria and will not be escalated. If the revalidate check box were not enabled, then the incident would be escalated, regardless of status and which group it was later assigned to. Generally, when configuring escalation rules, you will enable the Revalidate box so that records are revalidated at the time of escalation.  Recalculate Option  You can enable the Recalculate check box so that if an incident is updated before the escalation rule fires, the escalation time is recalculated based on the last time the incident was saved and updated. Just as it does when you select Revalidate, the rules engine compares each object to the ruleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conditions when you select Recalculate. The incident, answer, or opportunity that is updated must continue to match the ruleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conditions in order for the escalation to be rescheduled. If updating the object changes it so it no longer matches one or more rule conditions, Recalculate will not be triggered. For example, you can schedule an incident to be escalated 24 hours after it is updated. If the escalation rule has the Recalculate box enabled and the incident is updated within the 24 hours (before the incident is actually escalated), then the time of escalation will be recalculated based on the time of the last update. Note: For the Recalculate feature to be meaningful, you must select a relative time value that is not static. If you select a static value (such as Time Created) for your rule, the escalation schedule will not be recalculated because the Time Created value remains constant even when the object is updated. If, however, you select Time Updated, escalation will be rescheduled because the Time Updated value changes when the object is updated.  For additional information, refer to the 'Adding rules for escalation' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Customers must complete migration to Message Templates before upgrading to this release or later versions. For more infomation, refer to Answer 6143: Migration from Mail Scripts to Message Templates.";"  It Â is possible to configure your application so that it is no longer required that end-users reply between lines in order to update an incident via email. That is, your site can be configured so that you do not have to require users to include their update between the lines below: [===&gt; Please enter your reply below this line &lt;===] [===&gt; Please enter your reply above this line &lt;===] You can also configure your application so that users can click Reply in their mail client and reply to the incident response via email without having to specifically enter the text between pre-configured lines in the response. When receiving email replies, the techmail utility uses features within the email to distinguish between the new reply and content and the original message thread. Depending on how the user replies to your message, new replies can be added to the incident as a new entry in the discussion thread, while old content from the response sent to the end-user is discarded. With this configuration, text emails include a line of numbers at the bottom of the email to indicate the block count associated with the email that was sent. For example, text emails sent from your RightNow application include a line similar to the following: [---001:003894:09269---] This allows the application to determine the original block count of the email that was sent. If the email message is HTML-enabled, the block count is still a part of the email, but is not visible to the end-user. Two configuration settings, EGW_REPLY_BETWEEN_ENABLED and EGW_QUOTE_CHARS impact how replies to emails are handled:        EGW_REPLY_BETWEEN_ENABLED: If enabled, the Reply Between the Lines text is included in outgoing email messages. If the end-user replies to the email, only text that is between the lines will be included in the incident update. If this is disabled (the default setting), the end-userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reply is determined by excluding the block-quoted text from the email message. By default, this is set to No. Â            EGW_QUOTE_CHARS: This setting defines a list of characters used to quote the original text in email reply messages. Most email clients will quote the original text by inserting a greater-than symbol (&gt;), or a vertical bar (|) at the beginning of each line of original text. If you receive email replies that use a different character, you can add that character to this setting. Quoted lines in the email reply will be excluded from the incident update. The default value is &gt;|.     Â   Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  After editing the Value field, click Update. If necessary, click another setting, edit the Value field and click Update. When finished editing, click Commit and Exit to register your changes.  For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings.  Â   Methods for Detecting Reply Content for Emails  When an end-user replies to an email, there are several ways the user can include content in the reply, depending on how your site is configured: Reply Between the Lines If the configuration setting EGW_REPLY_BETWEEN_ENABLED is enabled and the Force Reply Between the Lines option is selected in the Service Mailbox, techmail processes replies by updating the incident with the content that was entered between the lines. Other content from the reply does not get updated in the incident. This functionality is consistent with previous versions of Oracle B2C Service.  Â  Block-quoted Text Indicators Most email clients mark or ""block quote"" the original message when someone replies to the message. In text messages, the original text is block quoted by inserting a greater than symbol (&gt;) or a vertical bar ( | ) at the beginning of each line of the original text. In HTML messages, the original message is usually enclosed in block quote HTML tags (&lt;blockquote&gt;). Parameters in the block quote HTML tag indicate how the message should be displayed, for example, each line might begin with a vertical bar or an indent. When EGW_REPLY_BETWEEN_ENABLED is disabled, techmail determines the block quoted content and determines how to update the incident based on how the customer replies to the message.        Message with No Block-quoted Content: If no block-quoted text is found, techmail includes the whole message in the update. Since some email clients allow the user to specify a block-quoted text indicator, you can define additional characters as indicators in the EGW_QUOTE_CHARS configuration setting described above. Â            Updated Content Outside of Block-quote: If the user's reply includes text that is only above or below the block-quoted text (or both above and below), then only the ""new"", updated content is included in the update to the incident.    In this case, techmail is able to distinguish the new content as being outside of the original content of the message. As a result, the content outside of the block quote is updated in the incident.   Â   If you have an automatic signature that appends to the end of your email responses, this signature will get updated within the incident since it is outside of the block quote section.    Note: In this case, the user cannot enter text within the block-quoted content. They can only add content outside (above or below) the original content. Â            Updated Content Intermixed with Block-quote: If the user includes content that is interspersed within the original block of content, then the entire email reply is updated in the incident. In this case, the techmail utility cannot distinguish between the original content of the email and the content that was added within the original block of text.    For example, if the original reply includes a few questions and the user replies to those questions by providing the answers within the original text, the incident thread is updated with the entire email.     Â  Note: If a word processor is used within the email client to create the reply message, such as MS Outlook or MS Word, then the incident will most likely be updated with the entire message. Word processors, specifically MS Word, includes the message update within the original message/byte count area. This indicates to RightNow's email parser that additional content has been added within the byte count area. As a result, all incoming messages using MS Word as an editor will insert the entire thread. Similarly, Hotmail and Eudora modify the message in the same way. There is no work around for these email clients within the current product design. If you determine that too many of your incidents are getting updated with the entire incident, you may decide to re-enable the reply between the lines feature."

When does an incident close if I update a Waiting incident?;Answer ID 2021;When will an incident be changed to the solved status if it has been updated after being set to Waiting?;['Answer ID 263', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Incident Statuses, Agedatabase Oracle B2C Service, All versions  Issue   We have anÃ‚Â incident set to a Waiting status. It wasÃ‚Â then updated, butÃ‚Â still leftÃ‚Â in the Waiting status. We would like to knowÃ‚Â when this example will be changed to the solved status.;"  When an incident is assigned to a waiting status type, the time is calculated for the agedatabase utility to automatically set the incident to Solved based on the CI_HOURS and CI_WAITING_CALC_DAYS configuration settings. The time for setting the incident to solved does not get recalculated if you update an incident or send a response if you leave the incident in the waiting status. However, if the status of the incident is changed from a waiting status type to an unresolved status type, the time for setting the incident to solved is cleared. Therefore, if you update an incident that is already set to a waiting status, but you would like the close date for the incident to be based on your update, you need to save the incident in an unresolved state and then set the incident to a waiting state.

Adding and requiring incident dispositions;Answer ID 2022;How do I set up incident dispositions?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Incident Dispositions, Customizable Menus Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  You Â can configure incident dispositions for use in your Oracle B2C Service application. Dispositions allow you to categorize incidents internally as a means of identifying how incidents are handled and resolved. Dispositions do not appear on the end-user pages. Agents can set the disposition when editing an incident. For example, you could have dispositions named: Public Answer Exists, Proposed as Answer, Customer Resolved, Agent Resolved, or Unreproducible Issue. Note: The Disposition field only displays in an interface if there is at least one disposition value that is visible to the interface. Â If none of the dispositions are enabled for visibility, the field does not display in the incident record. Â The Disposition field must be included in the workspace used by your staff in order to display. To add a disposition, use the steps below:  Go to Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Products Categories Dispositions Select New from the ribbon Add any new or change any existing dispositions you want. Enable visibility for the interface where this disposition will be used.  Sub-dispositions: You can add sub-levels of dispositions to allow for greater granularity in classifying your incidents. Dispositions can contain up to six levels. To add a sub-disposition, right click on a disposition listed in the left frame and select Add Incident Sub-Disposition. Then fill out the name, description, and visibility. You can also create the disposition and then drag and drop it on the parent disposition to create the subordinate relationship.  Deleting dispositions: If you delete a disposition, incidents associated with that disposition are set to Unspecified. In addition, if you delete a disposition, all sub-dispositions associated with it are deleted as well. To delete an item, right click on the value and select Delete. Please note, the 'Delete' option is not available for products, categories, or dispositions that have sub-levels. When deleting a product that has sub-products, for example, you must delete all of the sub-products first. You also cannot delete multiple products simultaneously.  Requiring Dispositions on Solved Incidents: Â  You can make the Disposition field required for incidents with a Waiting or Solved status type. Whether the disposition is required or not depends on the configuration of the workspace that is used by the staff member. Â  For the Disposition field, two properties indicate whether the Â Disposition field is required and under what conditions:  The Required (or RequiredOption) Â property allows you to specify if the disposition is required on new incidents, when an incident is edited, if it is always required or if it is never required.   The Required For Solved property allows you to have the Disposition field required if the incident is set to a Waiting or Solved status type. Enable this property (set to True) if you want to require a disposition for waiting and solved incidents.  Note: Â  The ""minimum level"" property in the Incident Workspace controls how many disposition levels are required.  For additional information, refer to the 'Organizing information with products, categories, and dispositions' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Using data exceptions to customize report records;Answer ID 2026;How can I customize the display of certain records in a report?;['Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 2532'];  Analytics, Data Exceptions Oracle B2C Service, all versions;" Data exceptions are used to highlight data that meet specific criteria within the overall report. This allows you to customize how certain records display in the report so that some records display in a different color or font style. Note: Data exceptions are not used to restrict data included in the report based on certain criteria you specify. That is, run-time and fixed filters are used to determine which data is included in your report. Â  Â Exceptions are used to affect the display of certain data within your report. Â  In the report, the data that matches the data exception is flagged in some fashion, such as with an asterisk or with a different color or font. For example, if your report includes all unresolved incidents assigned to a group, you can use a data exception to have all incidents that are assigned to a specific staff member display in a different font, such as bold or italics. You can define multiple data exceptions to use within a single report. This allows you to highlight multiple kinds of records for your audience. For more information on creating and editing custom reports, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a Basic Custom Report. Conditional formatting: Â  You can also use conditional formatting to customize the display of cell values in a specific column of your report. For more information on conditional formatting, refer to Answer ID 2532: Conditional Formatting of a Column in a Report. Adding Data Exceptions to a Report Each data exception consists of an Expression, Operator, and Value. These define the criteria for the record to match. If a record matches the criteria, that record displays based on how the Tabular and Graphical displays are set (including color and font). The Tabular style applies to records listed as output. The Graphical style applies to data points in a chart or graph. You must create separate data exceptions for each different color or style. For example, if you want some records to display as red, some as blue, and some as green, you must create three data exceptions -- one for each color and criteria. To define data exceptions within a report, use the steps below: Open the Â report for editing. Â   Â  Click Â the Display tab and enable the Exceptions checkbox. Â  Â Click the Insert tab on the ribbon, Â click in the Exceptions button to Â Add an Exception. Note: To edit an exception that already exists, Â right-click on the exception listed and select Edit Exception. Â   Â  In the pop-up window, add a name for the exception and set the display reference to be a specific output field or the entire row for the record. Â   Â  On the Definition tab, specify the criteria used for the exception. For example, to set incidents with an unresolved status to be red, set the contents on the Definition tab to be:  Â  Expression: incidents.status_type Operator: in list Value: Unresolved (enable checkbox) Â   Â  On the Tabular Display tab, specify the format and color used to display the record when listed in a table. You can use default display options or define a custom display option. Â  You can modify the color, data symbol and font style that will be used to display records that match the Â criteria on the Definition tab. Â   Â  If your report includes a graph, on the Graphical Display tab, specify the color Â associated with the exceptions. Â   Â  Click OK to close the exception window. Â   Â  Add or edit other exceptions as needed. Â   Â  When finished, save your report.  Run your report to verify that records meeting your exceptions display as you intend them to.  Examples of Data Exceptions Basic data exceptions: Â  The most basic data exception involves a single field in the definition. Â  This allows you to define the criteria using an operator and value that relates directly to that field. For example, if you want to define a data exception that displays all Updated incidents in blue, you can set the criteria to be: Expression: incidents.status_id Operator: in list Value: Updated Then, define the tabular display to use blue for the cell color or blue for the font color. Exceptions based on multiple criteria: Â  You may want to create a data exception based on the values of multiple fields. To do this, you can use an IF statement in the Expression of the exception. Â  Then set the data exception similar to the following: Expression: if(condition1 &amp; condition2 &amp; condition3,1,0) Operator: equals Value: 1 This means that if condition 1, 2, and 3 are all met, use a value of 1 for the expression, otherwise use 0. Then compare the expression value (1 or 0) to 1. Â  If the expression is 1, then the data exception is met. Note: To join multiple conditions in the first part of the IF statement, use an ampersand (&amp;) for AND and use a pipe ( | ) for OR. For example, to create a data exception for incidents that are in an updated status and have been updated more than an hour ago, the data exception is: Expression: if(incidents.status_id=8 &amp; date_diff(sysdate(),incidents.updated)&gt;3600,1,0) Operator: equals Value: 1 In this case, there are two conditions: Condition1 is: incidents.status_id=8  Â  where 8 corresponds to the numerical database value for the Updated status. You can get the ID by going to the incidents statuses table (from the Service Administration items &gt; Customizable Menus) Â and hovering over the Updated status. Â   Â  Condition2 is: date_diff(sysdate(),incidents.updated)&gt;3600  Â  For this condition, 3600 corresponds to the number of seconds for the interval of interest (one hour = 3600 seconds).  Â  The value is determined by using a date difference between the system date/time and the value of the incidents.updated field. Â  If the difference between the system date and the updated value exceeds 3600 seconds, the condition is met.  Finally, if both conditions are met, than the entire expression has a value of 1 based on the IF clause. Â  Otherwise, the expression has a value of 0. Â  Only records that meet both conditions match the data exception.  "

Inserting merge fields into a quote template;Answer ID 2030;How do I insert merge fields in a quote template?;['Answer ID 2005'];Outreach / Feedback, Mailings, Merge Fields;" When configuring quote templates, you can insert merge fields  Â in the template so that when the sales quote is generated, specific sales, contact, or organization data are included in your sales quote. Merge fields allow you to incorporate database information into the specific quote.            The merge field represents a database table and field that is replaced with specific information when the quote is generated. Within the quote template, merge fields are displayed in italics so that you can easily see which part of the quote will be replaced with specific data when the quote is generated. There are three types of merge fields that can be added to a template single, group, and indexed. The screenshot Â below provides a basic example of a quote template.        Single Items: Click this dropdown menu to select merge fields that have a one-to-one relationship with opportunities. For example, an opportunity can only be associated with one organization. As a result, fields such as Organization Name (orgs.name) and organization custom fields are single merge fields. Â              Group Items: Â Click this dropdown menu to select merge fields that have a many-to-one relationship with opportunities. For example, a quote can have many products (sa_prod2quotes.original_name_group) associated with it. Similarly, several different contacts can be associated with an opportunity.   As a result, contact information, product to quote information and even organization address data (since an organization can have more than one type of address) can all be used as group fields in a quote. The most common use of merged fields is to create a table of the products, costs, and quantities to be purchased.   Grouped merge fields must be used in a table. Note: You must create a table with column headers before using merge fields from the Group Items dropdown menu. After the table is created with column headers, a merge field from the Group items dropdown menu must be inserted into a single cell in a table. Word automatically adds rows to the table based on how many values are in the group. The font of the column headers Â determines the font of the merge fields in the table.    When the quote is generated, the multiple records are listed as separate rows in the table. That is, if you use group fields to list the various contacts associated with the opportunity, if there are five contacts associated, the resulting table will have six rows -- the top row is the column headings and the five rows include the contact information as generated from the merged fields. Â              Indexed Items: Indexed merge fields also have a many-to-one relationship with opportunities. In addition, these fields are indexed in the database to distinguish each item that is associated.    Indexed merge fields include a number after the field name so that you can specify which specific record to include in the quote. When selecting an indexed field, there is an ""N"" at the end of the field. You must change the ""N"" to be a numeric value to indicate the specific record you wish to populate into the quote. While using a field from the Group Items dropdown Â returns all of the contacts associated with an opportunity, using a field from the Indexed Items dropdown menu returns only the contact you specify according to ""N"". When working with contact fields, use ""1"" in place of the ""N"" to indicate the primary contact that is associated with the opportunity.    For example, an opportunity can have many contacts and contacts.full_nameN  Â is the indexed merge field you can select to display the full name of the contacts associated with the opportunity. To list the full name of the primary contact, use contacts.full_name1  Â in your quote template.     The font of single and indexed merge fields in a quote template is determined by the font of the non-merge field text in the template. The font of merge fields is determined by the font of the non-merge field text directly preceding the first merge field in the template. This will cause all merge fields in the template to display in the merged quote in that font.     For more information on quote templates, refer to Answer ID 2005: Adding or Editing a Quote Template."

This will give you the ability to use Oracle's self-service tools (Configuration Assistant) to generate CSR to provide to your certificate authority.  Â You will need to pay a fee to the certificate authority.  Â Once you have the certificate you would implement the new SSL certificate/s through Configuration Assistant (self service tool). You should work with your IT staff to get the correct certificates. A description of the most common certificate types used for Oracle B2C Service can be found at the following answer: Answer ID 9251: What type of custom domain SSL certificate is best for my organization's needs? When your site is first provisioned with Oracle B2C Service, your interfaces are added to our *.custhelp.com wildcard certificate and are provided with SSL coverage. The need for custom domain SSL comes in when you are interested in re-branding your website's domain with a custom name of your choosing. This will require that you come off our *.custhelp.com certificate and provide us with your own, which we then host in our server environment. The following answer has a full walkthrough of this process using our self-service tools in Configuration Assistant, which you must use if your account has been 'cloudified': Answer ID 7988: Managing SSL Certificates using Oracle B2C Service Configuration Assistant The certificate process in self-service will begin with generating a CSR, or Certificate Signing Request, for the new custom domain. This is effectively an order form for the certificate, and the contents of the CSR will be output into a hash format. The CSR you use to purchase your certificate must come from our tools in self-service, otherwise the certificate will not be compatible in our environment, and attempting to upload the certificate through self-service will cause a failure. This installation process will include a change to the vhosts for the interface(s) you are updating. Every interface must have at least one primary vhost, but can have multiple alternate vhosts. Alternate vhosts always redirect to the primary vhost, and that is their only function. When you first have your site provisioned, you will notice that an interface's primary vhost matches the example format 'companynamehelp.custhelp.com'. When your custom certificate is installed, the new custom domain you have chosen will become the primary vhost, and the original custhelp.com address will become an alternate that redirects to the new primary address. This vhost change requires some brief downtime while the new DNS information propagates throughout the web. This is generally brief, and lasts up to about 30 minutes. Nevertheless, you may wish to schedule the installation for a lower-impact time as a result. The new vhost is associated to your original interface address by the use of CNAME records in DNS. This is a record type that defines the new custom address as an alias for the original custhelp.com address. A real-world example of this can be seen with our support pages: id 5066 opcode QUERY rcode NOERROR flags QR RD RA ;QUESTION cx.rightnow.com. IN CNAME ;ANSWER cx.rightnow.com. 14 IN CNAME rightnow.custhelp.com. ;AUTHORITY ;ADDITIONAL  These will need to be added by your local DNS administrators. The CNAME must be in place prior to making any vhost changes. If they are not in place and the vhost records are changed, you would face a significant site down scenario. For this reason, our self-service system performs a CNAME check and will prevent changes if no record is present, and will lock the user out from further changes. If you need to renew an existing certificate, most of the steps will be the same as shown above in the Configuration Assistant walkthrough, however you are able to use an already existing CSR from previous years as long as your company data has not changed. The most common causes of issues in self-service are attempting to use a CSR that was not generated from our self-service tools, not having the CNAME in place before making vhost changes, or not purchasing a certificate from a major, reputable Certificate Authority. Please Note: If you require a www. version of your new domain to be covered with SSL on the certificate, the CSR and resulting certificate must explicitly define a Subject Alternative Name with the 'www.' version of the address. This is because the leading 'www.' is not assumed on the Internet, and must be clearly specified on a certificate in order to provide SSL coverage. If you encounter issues uploading your certificate, please create a service request and choose 'SSL' as the product in question. Lastly, Oracle B2C Service Technical Support recommends that you purchase your cert Â from DigiCert. DigiCert is the authority that has been the most thoroughly tested with our services, and your end-users and agent devices should already have native support, with all required roots installed with no additional input needed. Â  Â   It is also critical to note any integrations you have that may be dependent on a vhost name and its associated IP address. It is important that all integrations be examined for hard-coded values, and the Oracle B2C Service department should be alerted to these dependencies as part of the vhost change request process. Note: Oracle charges per IP for custom SSL. If you purchase either a wildcard or a SAN certificate, then all interfaces can use the same certificate and the same IP address. If for some reason you choose separate certificates for each interface, then each interface would require us to assign an IP address and we would need to charge for each IP used. In general, it is in the customer's best interest to cover as many domains as possible, on as few certificates as possible.  Additional Actions Changing the vhost of an interface will result in the change of multiple application components and deployment files for the Oracle B2C Service admin console. Please be aware that any instances of your site/interface that were installed previous to a vhost change will require a reinstall using the new launch URL."

Accessing & troubleshooting private reports;Answer ID 2035;How can I see all private reports for our various staff members?;['Answer ID 2059', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Private Reports Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Accessing Private Reports  There is a system-defined administrator account (see Â Answer ID 2059: Oracle B2C Service System Administrator account). When logged in as the system administrator, you can access the private reports for all staff members who have staff accounts. The administrator account is a special account that is not defined in the staff table and has no profile configured for it. When logged in as the system administrator, you have limited access to Â access configuration features and reports. The administrator can access all reports Â in the application. This allows you the ability to access private Â  reports Â for staff members who have left your organization or have been disabled for some reason. This allows you the ability to edit, move, or delete these items as appropriate. This is especially useful if you have a dependency associated with custom fields or specific reports. Private reports that are accessible only to the staff member who created them are stored in the My Reports folder. Other staff membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ My Reports folders are not displayed in the Reports explorer. However, Oracle B2C Service administrators can log in with the system-defined administrator account in order to access every accountÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s folders. This ensures that private reports can be edited, moved, and deleted if necessary. Â  Clicking a folder in the Reports explorerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tree displays the folderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contents in the list on the right. For additional information, refer to the 'Reports Explorer' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Troubleshooting Private Reports  Should you need assistance in troubleshooting issues with private reports, it's important to know that Oracle B2C Service Technical Support can query a database for some details about a private report, but cannot directly troubleshoot reports in private locations (My Reports, or any of its sub folders). If assistance is needed, the report will need to be copied to a public location (Public Reports, or any of its sub folders). It is highly recommended that the report be copied rather than moved.

Determining which records have file attachments;Answer ID 2036;How can I determine which records have file attachments?;['Answer ID 2509'];  File Attachments;"  Paperclip Icon By default, when you open a record in the administration pages, if a file is attached, a paperclip displays on the Â tab in the console. This allows staff to easily see if a file is attached to the record without having to click the tab to see the specific attachment(s). Â  For answer attachments, the paperclip displays regardless if the attachment is set as a public or private attachment. The Show Image workspace property specifies whether the paperclip icon displays on the tab. In the default workspaces, the Show Image property on the File Attachments relationship item is enabled (set to True) so that the paperclip icon displays by default on the Â Files tab. You can disable the paperclip from displaying by editing the workspace used by the staff member. Â  Click the File Attachments relationship item and Â disable the Show Image property. Note: The paperclip icon only displays on the tab where the File Attachment relationship item is located. If the Attachments tab is nested within another tab (such as Details or Summary tab), the paperclip displays on the embedded tab, but not the parent tab. With nested tabs, the staff member must click the parent tab and then they would see the paperclip on the nested tab.  Custom Report of Records with Attachments You can create a custom report to list which answers have file attachments. Â  This allows you to easily find and review which records have file attachments. For example, you can create a report that lists which answers have Â file attachments to ensure the content of both the answer and attachment are accurate. The steps below are specific to listing file attachments used with answers. You could also list file attachments for other records, such as incidents or organizations by selecting a different value for the fattach.tbl field. For more information on creating a basic custom report, refer to: Answer ID 2509: Creating Custom Reports  From the RightNow Console, click New &gt; Report. In the Report Outline, right click on Filters and select Add Filter. Set Â a filter for the File Attachments &gt; Table field as follows and click OK: Expression: fattach.tbl Operator: in list Value: Answers Â   Â  Note: You can set the Value field to another type of record to report on other records that have file attachments.  Â  Â  Add other run-time or fixed filters as you wish. Add output columns to your report from the File Attachments and Answers table such as: Answer ID (answer.a_id) Answer Summary (answers.summary) File Attachment ID (fattach.file_id) File Attachment User Name (fattach.userfname) Date Created (fattach.created) Â   Â  Click the Data tab &gt; Sort button and set how the records are to be sorted.

An account has been created for you with the following User ID and password: User ID: emailaddress@domain.com Password: o2Ud1J8d We encourage you to login to our support site and change your password, by clicking the following link, or pasting it into your browser:  With the contact password mechanism requiring an email to be sent for the contact to change a password, the only way to disable these messages is to disable EGW_PASSWD_CREATE. NOTE: This does not apply if you are using Pass Through Authentication (PTA) and configuration setting PTA_IGNORE_CONTACT_PASSWORD is enabled. Refer to Â Answer ID 5442: Disabling the Finish Account Creation email when using PTA for more information. When a new account is created and the EGW_PASSWD_CREATE configuration setting is enabled, a random password is also created for the account and the login information is sent automatically to the new contact. If the Update Contact Information message is enabled, it is sent to the new contact and provides them with their User ID and Password. Â  (Note: beginning with the May '09 release, the email does not contain the random password, but a encrypted link for the contact to click and create their own password.) If you allow incidents to be created from incoming email and a new user submits an email to your mailbox, when the EGW_PASSWD_CREATE setting is enabled and the Update Contact Information message is enabled, the following steps occur:  An incident is created from the email.   A contact record is created and the User ID is set to be the email address. If the users first and last name can be extracted from the email address, the names fields are populated in the account.   Since EGW_PASSWD_CREATE is enabled, a random password is created for the account.   The User ID and Password information for the new contact record is sent to the email address in the Update Contact Information email message.  Therefore, to prevent this information from being sent automatically, you can disable the EGW_PASSWD_CREATE setting or disable the Update Contact Information message. Disable EGW_PASSWD_CREATE: By disabling the EGW_PASSWD_CREATE setting, a random password will not be set for any new accounts created by new email, which means the message will not be sent to the user providing the login information.

Blocking spam email that has foreign characters;Answer ID 2045;Is there a way for us to define a rule to catchÃ‚Â spam usingÃ‚Â foreign characters?;['Answer ID 5442', 'Answer ID 1960'];  Email Messages Oracle B2C Service;" To block emails that do not contain characters from a supported Latin-based language, you can create an incident rule that has a Â condition to evaluate the email header. If the email header matches certain criteria, then you can configure the rule to either not create the incident or to route the incident to a different queue for review. The email header includes the character set used for the email content and you can include the foreign character set in the IF condition of the rule. Â  As a result, when the email header includes the specific character set, it will match the rule and trigger the action you indicate. In order to determine the foreign character set used in the incoming email, the EGW_SAVE_EMAIL_HEADERS configuration setting must be enabled. Â  Â This setting can be enabled using the path: Â  Configuration Editor &gt; RNT Common &gt; Heading: Modules &gt; Sub-heading: RightNow Email. To set up the rule, you must first determine the character set used in the emails that you want to block. Â  Within your site, find an incident that you want to block based on the characters. Â   Â  Open the incident and click the envelope icon to view the email header. Â   Â  Within the header, find the line that includes: charset=[character set name]. Â  This tells you the character set to include in your rule. Â  For example, most emails sent from Japan use iso-2022-jp. Â   Â  Repeat these steps for emails created from other character sets as well.  With the names of character sets Â for the emails that you would like to block, you can create a rule similar to the following. Be sure to list the specific character sets in the IF condition: IF Incident.E-Mail Header matches regular expression character set 1|character set 2|character set 3 Â  THEN assign incident to certain queue or do not create incident  When you first create this rule, it is best to allow the incident to be created and route them to a specific queue or staff member for review. Â  This ensures that the rule is not acting on emails that you want to allow in to your site. Â  Then, after a time, you can determine if the rule is adequately catching the emails of interest and then you can modify the rule to not create the incident."

Using an AND join with keyword searching;Answer ID 2049;When searching, can I configure Oracle B2C Service to use an AND between words instead of the OR join?;['Answer ID 1960'];   Phrase Searching in Oracle B2C Service;"  By default, Oracle B2C Service uses OR as a connector between words when multiple words are included in a search. This is for searching both answers and incidents. Â You can modify two configuration settings that allow you to specify whether the words should be joined by OR or by AND.        ANS_AND_SEARCH: If enabled, Complex Expression and regular Â Phrases searches performed on answers at both Â the end-user Answers tab and at the administration console are treated as though the words are joined by an AND connector (Boolean ""AND"" searches). If disabled, words are joined by an OR connector (Boolean ""OR"" searches). This option does not affect Similar or Exact Search. Default is disabled (No).    Note: Â Aliasing works with both AND or OR searching as configured by the ANS_AND_SEARCH configuration setting. Â  However, if aliases contain spaces, phrases will be expanded before aliases are processed. Â  Â Example:    Assume the aliases.txt file contains (note the space within RIGHT NOW): Â  Â RIGHT NOW,RNT  Assume an answer contains ""RNT"".  Search for ""RIGHT NOW""    If ANS_AND_SEARCH is enabled, a search for ""RIGHT NOW"" will not return the RNT answer since a Boolean AND search tries to match all single word phrases. Â  Â In this case, it would try to match both ""RIGHT"" and ""NOW"". Â  Â Since ""RIGHT"" and ""NOW"" do not have aliases, the search will not match the RNT answer even though the ""RIGHT NOW"" phrases will expand to include ""RNT"". Â             SC_AND_SEARCH: If enabled, searches performed on incidents Â at both the Account - Questions page and the administrative console Â are joined by an AND connector (Boolean ""AND"" searches). If disabled, words are joined by an OR connector (Boolean ""OR"" searches).     Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings. Note: With the ANS_AND_SEARCH or SC_AND_SEARCH configuration setting enabled, an OR search is no longer possible with searching. Instead, the user might begin searching with a three- or four-word combination, and if the incident or answer isn't returned, the user could do a less restrictive two- or three-word search followed by an even less restrictive search. If you want to have the ability to do both OR and AND searching, you can disable the configuration setting and use the ""+"" character before each word in your search string to indicate that each word must be in the incident or answer in order to be returned in the search."

Spam being sent from our Oracle B2C Service support address;Answer ID 2050;HowÃ‚Â can I prevent spam from getting sent from our Oracle B2C Service site?;['Answer ID 1960'];  Outgoing Email, Spam;" To investigate this type of issue, your mail administrators should check your mail logs to determine any occurrences of the email address that received the spam message. In such cases, it is quite likely that they will find that no emails were sent to that address. There are a number of bad viruses that can cause this type of email. These types of viruses infect a PC, grab all the email addresses stored on the PC, and then send massive amounts of email to the addresses, including an attachment with the virus. Â These virus emails have a spoofed FROM address which uses one of the other addresses stolen from the infected PC. Â  Detailed information on viruses are available on a number of websites, which can be found by doing an Internet search on ""virus"". Most likely in a case like this, the infected PC is a home computer somewhere that happened to have both your support email address and the spam recipient's email addresses stored on it. Thus, there is nothing that either you nor the spam recipient can do to prevent these types of emails from being sent. You should relay this information to the spam recipient so that they can be aware of the real issue. By closely examining the Received: headers of the spam message, you may be able to identify where the offending email originated from. You might want to ask your customer for the offending spam message, including the headers. This will allow you to review the headers of the email to possibly determine where the message originated from. Note, however, that it is possible for the virus to also forge most of the Received: headers. The topmost Received: header should be correct, but the others may not be correct. While the headers can be forged by spammers, it is not as common as the FROM email address. As a result, you have a better chance to determine which mail server really sent the email by reviewing these headers. A sample email header is provided below. For example purposes, the server and email information have been generalized such as ""account@domain.com"". The header has also been truncated a bit to make it easier to read. Most email services permit users to view headers, but they all have different ways to access the headers. Thus, accessing the header information in an AOL email is quite different than accessing the header in Microsoft Outlook. For example, in AOL, to obtain this header information, open the email and click the Details link that appears at the top of the e-mail, below the from address and subject line. In the example below, the Received lines are the most useful. From the top, they represent the receipt on the e-mail servers that handled this e-mail from most recent to least recent. The top Received line is usually the machine that actually performed final delivery of email. One indication that the headers may have been spoofed is if the ""by hostname.domain"" portion does not match the ""from hostname.domain"" portion within the Received line. ============================================ Return-Path: &lt;account@domain.com&gt; Received: from mailserver1.aol.com (mailserver1.aol.com [server's IP Address]) by mailserver1l.aol.com ...

Scheduled reports have no data;Answer ID 2051;Why are scheduled reports empty?;['Answer ID 1960'];  Analytics, Scheduled Reports Issue  My scheduled reports arrive as attachments, but when I open them, they contain no data. When I run the report manually from within our Oracle B2C Service site, the data displays as expected in the report.; In cases where the scheduled reports have no data, but the same report contains data when run from the administration console, this is an indication that the scheduled report may have been altered or filtered by an email filtering product. Report files are based upon XML and several filtering products may alter or truncate these files. For Â example, the software MailControl (formerly BlackSpider) has a setting labeled Filter Active HTML Content that inserts a string (defanghtml_) into XML files. This string effectively disables the file and makes the report appear blank. Filtering software used by your organization should be configured to exclude scheduled report mailings from altering files in such a manner. Contact your IT group to prevent filtering software from acting on scheduled reports in such a manner.

Using the Information Gap report;Answer ID 2052;What is the Information Gap report?;['Answer ID 1960'];  Analytics, Standard Report IDÃ‚Â 92 Oracle B2C Service;" The Information Gap report is used to identify potential answer content based on groupings of incidents that are not very well addressed in the public answers. The report evaluates incidents from the interface you specify and groups or clusters those incidents based on keywords common to the incidents. Each incident can belong to only one cluster. The keywords and clusters are then compared to your published answers to find the answer that most closely matches the search results. Clusters that are not strongly related to public answers have a more severe information gap. That is, the system determines that there is a group of incidents that are not adequately addressed by your published content. This report is used to identify content that exists in incidents submitted to your site but are not addressed in published answers. When you generate the report, the top level lists each incident cluster, along with an urgency value. The Urgency value indicates how severe the gap is between the content of the incident cluster and the content of the answers. The Urgency value is reported on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating a more severe gap between incident content and answer content. Note: The intent of the report is that someone evaluates the Urgency 1 clusters and decides if creating an answer is appropriate. It is not intended to dictate that answers should necessarily be created, but rather the report should be used to identify where a staff member needs to focus attention. Upon review of the clusters with an urgency value of 1, you may decide that it is not necessary to publish information related to that cluster if that information is not valuable to your general audience. Since the queries behind this report are generated each time it is run, the output will change over time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for example, after adding a new answer to address an urgent 1 cluster or gap.  Definition of Top Level Report When you generate the report, the top level of the report includes the following columns of information:   Gap ID: This is the row ID to identify the ordered clusters of incidents. Â   Â   Urgency Level: This loosely corresponds to the size of the cluster and the quality match with an answer. In general, large clusters with poor matches to answers receive a more urgent score, whereas clusters that match answers fairly well will receive a less urgent value. The urgency value can range from 1 to 5 with 1 being the most urgent level. Â   Â   Summary: These keywords are the most representative keywords for the cluster, extracted from the incidents. You can click on the keywords to view the individual incidents in the cluster. Â   Â   Number Incidents: Indicates how many incidents are in the cluster. Â   Â   Answer ID: Indicates the Answer ID of the specific answer best matches the keywords for the cluster. Â   Â   Answer Score: Indicates how well the best answer matches the cluster keywords. A higher numerical value indicates a stronger match. A lower value indicates a weak match. Â    Therefore, when you first generate the Information Gap report, incident clusters are sorted first by the Urgency value in ascending order (1 to 5) with a secondary sort by score in ascending order. This allows the most urgent clusters with the poorest match results to an answer to be listed at the top of the report.  Definition of Drill Down Level When you drill down into a cluster, the information below is displayed:   Incident ID: Indicates the unique incident ID in the database.  Â   Subject: The subject line of the incident. Â   Â   Score: Indicates which incidents are the most representative of the entire cluster. A relatively high value indicates that the incident is closely related to the keywords of the cluster. A lower value indicate a weak relationship to the overall cluster. Â    From the drill-down level, you can view the specific incident by clicking on the incident and selecting Display Incident Details.  Configuration Settings that Affect the Report Two configuration settings affect the Information Gap report when it is run:   GAP_FREQUENCY: Â Specified how frequent (in days), the Information Gap report Â is generated. Default value is 7 days.  Â   GAP_TIME_PERIOD: Specifies the time period included in the Information Gap report.The report analyzes incident created during the specified number of days. Default value is 7 days. Â  Â   Â    Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  "

This guide is intended to be both an insightful and practical tool for developing, tuning and managing reports and analyses within your Oracle B2C Service instance. 2) Â  Â The Analytics Cookbook - The Analytics cookbook is intended to be a tool to help you learn B2C Service Analytics through short YouTube functionality/techniques tutorials and report Ã¢â‚¬Å“recipesÃ¢â‚¬Â that describe cool use cases. Â  Â The tutorial videos walk through one specific area of B2C Service Analytics to help you better understand how to configure/use that functionality along with subtle nuances and best practices inherent to each area. Â  Â The report recipes outline individual specific reporting use cases, report configuration details for those use cases, and the exported XML report definition that can be imported directly into your instance of B2C Service. Â  Â The Analytics Cookbook allows users to learn specific functional areas and incorporate these into cool use cases to help expand your Analytics IQ. Â  Â Please note: The Analytics Cookbook is intended to be a living learning tool and will be updated with new technique videos and report recipes as time goes on. 3) Â  Â The Report Management [Module] - Did I mention that there are more than 750 canned reports that are delivered with every instance of Service Cloud? Â  Â As of the Feb 2013 release, finding the right report for your use case has become a lot easier with keyword searching across report names and descriptions within the Report Management Module. Â  Â Although this is not technically a module in B2C Service, RMM has a nice ring to it so we refer to it that way. Â  Â Also included in RMM are administrative tools to help you do things like find all reports with schedules, find out which workspaces are using a specific report, find deferred reports, etc. Â  Â More details on the RMM can be found in the linked Analytics Cookbook recipe.  Happy Learning!

Including more years in the custom date fields;Answer ID 2055;How can I increase the maximum year displayed for our custom date fields?;['Answer ID 1960'];   Configuration Settings, Date Fields, All versions;"  The maximum value for a year menu is specified in the configuration setting, EU_MAX_YEAR. This setting specifies the maximum year displayed in drop-down menus for date fields on the end-user pages. This setting supports three types of values:  1) offset values such as -5 or +5 which return the current year +/- the offset 2) an actual year value (between 1970 and 2100) 3) a blank value which returns the current year. Default is blank  Note: While this configuration supports values up to 2100, the product will currently only store dates up to 2038. Values above 2038 are only recommended if being used within an external integration. Additionally, these values can also be configured directly through the DateInput widget using the 'max_year' and 'min_year' parameters. To view the widget documentation please navigate to the Custom Portal Administration Site.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. When custom date fields are enabled for editability on the Ask a Question page (by enabling the End-user Edit checkbox in the Visibility section of the custom field), the month, date, and year fields are drop-down menus."

Setting the Reply-To Address when forwarding incidents or sending report subscriptions;Answer ID 2056;Can we have the recipient's reply go to the staff member who forwarded the incident?;['Answer ID 2245'];   From / Reply-toÃ‚Â address for Scheduled Reports andÃ‚Â Forwarding Incidents Configuration Settings, Oracle B2C Service, All versions  Issue   Currently, when an incident is forwarded from theÃ‚Â administration pagesÃ‚Â and the recipient clicks Reply, the reply is sent in to our Oracle B2C Service site as a new incident.Ã‚Â  WeÃ‚Â would prefer that the reply be sent to the staff member who forwarded the incident.Ã‚Â   The same thing happens with report subscriptions. Can we set the reply-to address to be the staff member who created the subscription?;"  You can configure your Oracle B2C Service application to use a different reply-to address than the default mailbox. This can be configured separately for incidents forwarded manually from the administration pages, incidents forwarded using a business rule, and for scheduled report subscriptions as described below. Note: If you configure your application to use the staff member's email address as the From address, SPAM software might reject the email as SPAM if the email domain of the staff member does not match the email from which it is truly sent (also known as spoofing). If this happens, changing the configuration setting to use the default mailbox address should resolve this issue and allow the email to be delivered successfully. For more information on spoofed email, refer to Answer ID 2245: Scheduled reports and forwarded incidents are getting blocked. Incidents forwarded manually: Â The IFWD_UI_FROM_ADDR  Â configuration setting specifies the choice of options for the From (Reply-To) address when an incident is forwarded from the Support Console. The accepted values are listed below and the default value is 3:      1 -  The From address defined in the default mailbox for the interface     2 -  The From address defined in mailbox of mailbox_id in the incident     3 -  The email address of the staff member who forwards the incident.     In order to use option 3 correctly, the staff member's account must have an email address configured. If a staff account does not have an email address and option 3 is specified for this setting, the email address of the default mailbox for this interface is used when the incident is forwarded. Incidents forwarded from a Rule: Similarly, the IFWD_RULE_FROM_ADDR  Â setting specifies the choice of options for the From address when an incident is forwarded by Â business rule. The accepted values are listed below and the default value is 1:      1 -  The From address defined in the default mailbox for the interface     2 -  The From address defined in mailbox of mailbox_id in the incident     Report Subscriptions: For scheduled reports, the RPT_FROM_ADDR  Â configuration setting specifies the email address used when a report is emailed as a subscription or when using the Send To feature. The accepted values are listed below and the default value is 2:      1 -  The From address defined in the default mailbox for the interface     2 -  The email address of the staff member who owns the scheduled report and/or sends the report     3 -  The email address of the staff member who forwards the incident (this option is not available in all releases)     In order to use option 2 correctly, the staff member's account must have an email address configured. If a staff account does not have an email address and option 2 is specified for this setting, the email address of the default mailbox for this interface is used when the incident is forwarded. To edit either of these settings, use the path below: Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key."

Requiring the Email Address field in contact records;Answer ID 2057;In a contact record, is the Email Address field required?;['Answer ID 2451', 'Answer ID 2483', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Contacts, Workspaces Oracle B2C Service;  When creating a contact record from the end-user pages, the Email Address field is always required. This ensures that the support agent has a means of sending a response to incidents submitted via the Ask a Question page. From the administration console, the Email Address field may or may not be required. Â  The workspace used by the staff member determines whether the Email field is required or not. Within the workspace, you can select the Email field and then set the Required option property from the Design ribbon. To determine which workspace is used by the staff member, you must check the staff member's profile. For information on this, refer to Answer ID 2451: Assigning workspaces to staff profiles. For information on configuring workspaces, refer to Answer ID 2483: Setting up a New Workspace.

Oracle B2C Service System-Defined Administrator account;Answer ID 2059;What is the system-defined administrator account?;['Answer ID 538', 'Answer ID 4352', 'Answer ID 7537'];   Administrator Account;"  There is a system-defined administrator account in the Oracle B2C Service product. The system-defined administrator account is a special account that has a login name of ""administrator"" (""admin"" for Intelligent Advisor) and a specific password. The system-defined administrator account is not defined in the staff account table and has no navigation set or profile configured for it. New Sites: On new sites, you can use the system-defined administrator account to log in so that you can create a profile and staff accounts. When you first log in as the system-defined administrator, you will generally need to create a profile that has full administration rights and then create a staff account that uses Â that full administration profile. You can then log out as the administrator and log in as the newly created staff member, which will allow you access to all areas of the application. For information on adding staff accounts refer to Answer ID 538: Adding a staff account Â and for information on adding profiles, refer to Answer ID 4352: Adding a Staff Profile in May 2010 and newer releases. Password Reset: To reset the password of the system-defined administrator, use Â  Â Oracle Cloud Portal Configuration Assistant. This self-service tool will allow you to reset this account's password for your production or test site(s). If you have questions regarding the Oracle Cloud Portal service, please contact your account manager.  Limited functionality: This account can only access the Administration Console and cannot access the Â Oracle B2C Service Console. When logged in as the administrator, you cannot add new records such as incidents, answers, or contacts. Staff must log in using actual staff accounts to add these types of records. To access private reports: Log in as the administrator and click the Analytics navigation button and open the Reports explorer. Â  In the right frame, the Public Reports item is listed first followed by separate folders for each staff account in the application, such as Paul Jones Reports. Click the appropriate staff reports folder to see the private folders and reports for that staff member. You can drag and drop a report to a different location or delete it."

Configuring Staff Member Password for Better Security;Answer ID 2060;What Options are Available in the Password Configuration Settings for Improving Security of Staff's Passwords?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Staff Accounts, Password Configuration Oracle B2C Service;  You can enhance your staff membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ password security through options that allow you to prevent repeated invalid login attempts and to set password length, character requirements, and expiration options. To access the password configuration options, click the Configuration button on the navigation pane, and then double-click Â Password Configuration under Staff Management. Note: These Â options affect the login requirements for staff members logging in to the administrative side of Oracle B2C Service. Â They Â do not affect passwords and other login requirements for customers logging in to the customer portal end-user pages. For detailed procedures about configuring customer passwords, Â refer to the 'Define customer password requirements' section Â in the online documentation Â for your version. Â  Password configurations Â are interface-specific. Â That is, you can configure the password Â requirements on interface A separately from interface B. Â When a staff member Â configures or changes their password, the new password is compared to the password configuration table for the interface they are logging into. Â           Number of Invalid Logins: This field defines the number of failed login attempts that are allowed before the system locks the account. When an account becomes locked, the staff member cannot log in to the account, even if they use the correct Login and Password configured for the account. Only administrators Â with the Â Groups/Accounts/Distribution Lists permission can unlock a staff account by clearing the Account Locked checkbox. When a staff member successfully logs in to their account, the invalid login count is reset to 0. By default, staff accounts are locked after five unsuccessful login attempts.    Â Please note, the administrator account has the same log in requirements you have configured for your other staff accounts in the Password Configuration security options.         Expiration Interval: This field defines the number of days that passwords stay in effect. The expiration date is reset after creating a staff account or updating the account password from the Staff Accounts editor or the Change Password window. Â            Grace Period: This field defines the number of days after a password expires in which staff members can enter a new password and still be allowed to log in. Once the grace period ends, staff members' accounts Â are locked, and you must reset the expiration date or the password. Â              Warning Period: This field defines the number of days before the password expires in which staff members will be alerted to the approaching expiration date. During the period, staff members can log in normally and are notified of the number of days until the current password expires. Â    Note: Warnings only display if the Expiration Interval is set to a valid (non-zero) time interval.         Password Length: This field defines the minimum number of characters required for a staff account password. Password length Â cannot exceed 20 characters.    Note: If this value is increased, staff accounts that have fewer characters than the new requirement retain their current passwords. When the staff member updates their password, they will be required to specify a password of appropriate length. Until they update the password, however, their account may have a password that is shorter than what is configured.             Character Repetitions: This field specifies the maximum number of consecutive repeated characters allowed in a password. Â For example, if Character Repetitions is set to 2, then a password such as 11011011 would be allowed, but 1110000 would not be allowed.           Character Occurrences: This field specifies the maximum number of times a character can be used in a password. For example, if Character Repetitions is set to 2, then a password such as Â 10123456 would be allowed, but Â 10101234 would not be allowed.         Lowercase Characters: Â This field specifies the minimum number of lowercase characters required in a password.           Uppercase Characters: Â This field specifies the minimum number of uppercase characters required in a password. Â            Special Characters: Â This field specifies the minimum number of special characters required in a password. Â              Numbers and Special Characters: This field specifies the Â minimum number of special characters, including numbers, required in a password.         Number of Previous Passwords: Â This field specifies the number of Â passwords that will be stored in memory for each staff account. Staff members cannot use any of the currently stored passwords when changing passwords. Â         For additional information, refer to the 'Configure password requirements' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Updating Oracle B2C Service fundamentals;Answer ID 2062;What is the purpose of an upgrade site?;['Answer ID 8643', 'Answer ID 1925', 'Answer ID 4649', 'Answer ID 7850', 'Answer ID 2178'];   Oracle B2C Service;"  The production site is cloned when an update begins.  Â That clone is updated to the targeted version and Â known as the ""upgrade site"".  Â The Â clone is a full copy of the production database and configuration files, but excludes Â file attachments. Â  The upgrade site is destroyed approximately one week after the production site updates. Â  The B2C Service update mechanics require Â an upgrade site.  Â When a production Â B2C Service site is updated Â to a new version, the production database Â is merged with the upgrade site configuration files. Therefore, a Â test site cannot replace an upgrade site during an update. The upgrade site Â is ideal for testing, providing a non-production site on the targeted Oracle B2C Service version. The following components Â are generally tested on the upgrade site:  Service emails and incident management Customer Portal functionality in addition to ""look and feel"" External integrations &amp; Chat Installation of the updated .NET agent console Â to ensure workstation requirements are met Best practices for testing  Start to finish, updates should be completed in a timely fashion.  Â The average duration is two weeks.  Â A Â concise update helps minimize the Â impact of production restrictions which occur during an update.  Â Interfaces cannot be created, renamed, nor disabled.  Â New mailboxes cannot be provisioned.  Â Creation and updates to message base records and configuration settings create risk and require special handling. Â Refer to Â changes carried forward at update cutover for more information.  Â Lastly, custom field and Â Custom Object deployments are restricted.  Note:  There are Â important differences between a test site and an upgrade site even though both site types are non-production.  Â Some customers elect to perform some or all testing in their test site instead of in their upgrade site.  Â Customers taking this unconventional approach should ensure their test site is kept up to date with production.  Â Test sites are managed by the customer Â via the Â Configuration Assistant.  Â In summary, if the site name contains ""upgrade"", then the site is an upgrade site.  Â The site name can be seen in the URL when installing the .NET agent console and also in the Customer Portal URLs.  Â See Â Test Site vs. Upgrade Site Â for more information."

Changes to an incident or record are not getting saved;Answer ID 2064;Why don't my changes to an incident get saved?;['Answer ID 1873'];  Business Rules;" When an incident automatically reassigns a field value when the agent saves the record, this is frequently due to how rules are configured for the site. If the incident remains in the initial state after it is created, then the business rules associated with that initial state will run against the incident each time that incident is saved. Incidents remaining in the initial rule state may explain why certain fields are automatically reassigned each time the incident is saved. This includes fields such as the Queue, Assigned to, Status, and custom field values. Note: This same behavior can occur with other types of records, including answers, contacts, opportunities, tasks, and organizations. If the rules for these records allow the record to remain in the initial state, records will be changed based on the rule configuration for the initial state -- even though the record is not newly created. When Â a Â record matches a rule, it automatically continues on to be compared to the next rule in the list. If you want the Â record to stop being compared to the next rules in the list, you must include an action that either stops processing the rules, transitions the rule state and stops, or calls a function that has one of those actions. If the Â record does not match a rule that includes an action to transition the state, the record remains in the initial rule state. This means that when the record is next updated, it is compared to the set of rules that you use to route and handle new records. As a result, for incidents, if your initial rules assign the incident to a particular queue or staff member, incidents that still have the initial rule state will get assigned in a similar fashion. To troubleshoot why incidents or other records are automatically getting saved to other values, check the following items:  Check the Rule State for the Record Verify that the record is associated with the correct rule state that should trigger the rule when the record is updated. Â  When a record is updated, it is compared to the rules for the state to which it is associated. New records added to the site are assigned to the rule state that you set to be the initial rule state. The record is then compared to the rules in that initial state and may be transitioned to other states based on the rules they match. Then on future updates, the record is compared to the rules for the current rule state. To determine the rule state for a record: Open the Â record for editing and hover over the information icon. Â  You Â can click the Info button or hover over it. Note that the fields listed on the Info button can be customized in the workspace. Â  If the rule state is not listed, review the configuration of the workspace you are using. Â  Â  Check the value of the Rule State field. If it specifies the rule state you have set as the initial state, then the Â record will always be compared to the initial rules, and fields will be set as though it were a new Â record being created in the system. This frequently occurs with incidents and appears to the staff member that edits they make to certain fields are not being saved. Instead, the incident is typically hitting the rules used for initial routing, and Â those initial rules are Â reassigning fields, such as queues or the group or assigned to fields. Null rule states: Â  If records are added via imports, such as contact records added using the Contact Uploader or records added from integrations, those records may have a null rule state. Â  If a record has a null rule state, the record is not compared to any rules when it is updated. Â  When Â the record Â is updated and saved, the record remains with a null rule state. To resolve this issue, activate the rule base. When the rule base is activated, you will get a message indicating that there are X number of records with a null rule state. At that point, set which rule state those records should be set to and continue activating your rules. Â  The records will be set to the rule state but will not be compared to the rules for that rule state since the records were not actually edited or updated to trigger the rules. Then, evaluate the process for importing those types of records. Â  Determine which rule state should be set when the records are imported or created and make that part of the import / creation process. That way, the records have the correct rule state so that when they are updated, the rules will act on the records as you expect.  Determine Which Rules Acted on the Â Record Use the Rule Log to determine which rules have acted on that specific incident or record. To use the rule log, use the following steps: From the Configuration items, select Site Configuration &gt; Â Logs. Click the Rule Log button on the ribbon.  Â  Set the Type to be Incident, enter the reference number in the ID field and click Search. The rules that acted upon the record display in the search results. Now, you can review those rules to determine which actions or follow-on actions should occur -- including how best to transition the rule state for the incident. For more information on using the Rule Log with other types of records, refer to Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log to Troubleshoot Rules.  Include an Action that Transitions the State Somewhere in the path of the initial rules, each Â record should end up being transitioned to another non-initial state. For example, with incidents, Â follow the incident through the rules in the corresponding state and functions to determine where the incident finally ends up. At the point that the incident has hit all of the appropriate rules, that rule should include one of the following actions:   Transition State and Stop -- the record is transitioned to the state but is not compared to any rules in that state. The next time the record is updated, it is compared to the rules in the state.  Â   Transition State and Continue -- the record is transitioned to the state and is then compared to the rules in that state. Â  So additional actions may affect the record due to hitting rules within the transitioned state.  Â   Call Function -- where the function leads to an action that transitions the state and either stops or continues. Â  That is, the function includes a rule that is hit and includes Â either Â Transition State and Stop Â or Transition State and Continue. Â   Therefore, when reviewing the rules for the record or incident that keeps getting updated, you must determine where in the overall set of rules you need to include the transition action."

Including an incident thread in a report;Answer ID 2068;How do I include part of the incident thread in a custom report?;['Answer ID 2509'];   Incidents, Analytics;"  Incident thread data is retained in a separate table from the general incidents table. In addition, there are several different types of threads, which allows you to configure your report to include only certain thread types, such as Customer Entry or Customer Proxy. Important! Typically, reports that include incident threads become large very quickly and generally take longer to generate. When you create Â a report that includes incident threads, you should include a run-time filter that includes a range for the incident created date. That way, you can test your report for a small range of dates, which will allow your report to generate more quickly.  When creating a report that includes an incident thread, it is important to define the data set to use the Incidents table as the primary table and then join the Threads table to the Incidents table. To do this, use the steps below:  From the navigation area, select Analytics &gt; Reports Explorer Â  Select the New Report button from the Home ribbon Select the type of report to add (See Â Creating a basic custom report Â for more information on creating a custom report.)   From the Home ribbon, click the Tables button In the Data Set Â window, click Select Table Expand the All Tables list and double click on Incidents (incidents). The incident table displays in the left frame.   Right click on the Incidents table and select Join To &gt; Threads &gt; incidents.i_id =&gt; threads.i_id. Â The threads table displays under the incidents table. Click OK. The Data Set window closes.      With the data set defined properly, add filters and output columns to your report. Â  To restrict the thread to a specific type: Â  Include a fixed or run-time filter based on the threads.entry_type field. Â   From the Home ribbon, click the Filters button Example filter definition would be:  Expression: threads.entry_type Operator: equals Value: Customer (select desired thread type from drop down list)  Â  Â   Â  NOTE: Value selection options change depending on the operator selected.  Â  Â   Â  Â i.e. 'In List' allows you to select more than one thread entry type.   Click OK.    With the filter in place, you can add the thread as an output column for the report. Â  From the Threads table, drag the Text (notes) field to be an output column. Â  All thread of a type matching those set within your filter selection will be listed in the report results.    Reporting on the first thread entry To include the first thread entry for an incident, first add a filter on incidents.ref_no or incidents.i_id; then use the following column definition: substr(min(concat(date_format(threads.entered, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS'), concat(threads.seq, to_char(threads.note)))),16)  This can be modified to fit your needs. Â  Â For example, if you want to report on the most recent thread entry, change the min() function to a max() function. Â  Â Otherwise, if you want to return something other than the thread text, change the threads.note reference to your desired threads field. For example: -- Most recent thread entry per incident: substr(max(concat(date_format(threads.entered, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS'), concat(threads.seq, to_char(threads.note)))),16) -- The channel ID for the first thread entry: substr(min(concat(date_format(threads.entered, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS'), concat(threads.seq, to_char(threads.chan_id)))),16)"

Editing the email messages sent with different incident statuses;Answer ID 2075;How can I configure our site to send different types of messages when we respond to incidents?;['Answer ID 5380', 'Answer ID 1001'];   Message Bases, Service E-mails, Notifications;"  When a response to an incident is sent, the text in the top part of the response depends on the status type that the incident is set to. If the incident status is a Solved status type, the response will use a different message base and Â message content Â than if the incident is set to a status that is an Unresolved or Waiting status type. You Â can edit these message bases if you wish. If the agent sends a response and the incident is still set to an Unresolved status type (Unresolved or Updated status), the assumption is that the agent is still working on the issue. As such the message uses the message base that indicates ""We are continuing to work on your issue. If you have more information, update your question here."" Similarly, if the incident is set to Waiting or Solved, the content of the message changes and uses different message bases accordingly. You can verify this on your own site using a test incident and sending responses to your email account with the incident assigned to a different status each time. Note: As of the November 2012 release, you can use message templates, per interface, to customize Â the content of your messages, including administrator notifications, administrator emails, and contact emails. See Answer ID 5380: Customizing notifications and email messages sent by Oracle B2C Service. Staff members can edit message bases only if their staff profile allows it. Â The staff profile must have the Configuration option enabled on the Â Administration tab.  Accessing Message Bases  To access message bases used in the incident response messages.  From the Configuration menu, select System Configuration &gt; Message Bases. Select the RightNow folder only from available filters. From the folder Â listing on the left, expand the RightNow folder and scroll down to select Â (as an Â example) Incident Response folder &gt; Messages Message Bases relating to this message type are then listed with their default values.  Each message based has a text version (_TXT) and an (_HTML) version. The message base used depends on whether the Incident Response email message is HTML-enabled in the Email Messages table. From the list of folders, you can determine which message base to edit. Then, click the message base and modify the Custom Text field and Save. You can copy your edited content in the Description field as well so that it will display when you click the Incident Response heading. You can also select Save on the main Message Base editor after you have finished editing Â multiple message bases to commit all changes.

Standard network troubleshooting practices;Answer ID 2077;How can we determine if we have good network connectivity to ourÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service site?;['Answer ID 31', 'Answer ID 2412'];  Network Connectivity;" As a web-delivered product, Oracle B2C Service requires a constant high speed Internet connection to function properly. Sporadic product errors across multiple workstations can be attributed to connectivity problems between your location and the Oracle B2C Service data center hosting your site. First, verify connectivity from an affected workstation by using the Ping command. From the start menu, select Run, and type cmd and click OK. This opens a command prompt window. At the prompt type ping &lt;yoursitename&gt;.custhelp.com -l 800 -n 100. This command will send 100, 800-byte pings to the Oracle B2C Service servers. The response times should be consistent and there should be no dropped packets.  For example, pinging rightnow.custhelp.com [216.136.229.11] with 800 bytes of data could give the following results: Command: ping rightnow.custhelp.com -l 800 -n 100 Reply from 216.136.229.11: bytes=800 time=220ms TTL=246 Reply from 216.136.229.11: bytes=800 time=208ms TTL=246 Reply from 216.136.229.11: bytes=800 time=213ms TTL=246 . . . Ping statistics for 216.136.229.11:  Â  Â  Packets: Sent = 100, Received = 100, Lost = 0 (0% loss), Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:  Â  Â  Minimum = 184ms, Maximum = 281ms, Average = 223ms  Note: Â  Some networks are configured not to allow ping traffic and will block ping results. If this is the case, engage your IT department to run these connectivity tests from a network location where ping traffic can pass. Ping results: Any large variance in response times or dropped packets should be investigated by the IT department as a sign of connectivity problems. If the same behavior is not evident from the edge of your network, the issue is most likely local to your network and must be remedied by your IT resources. Refer to the Â Oracle B2C Service Infrastructure Requirements for guidance on network device configuration. Â This is available in Â Answer ID 31: Oracle B2C Service Infrastructure Requirements. If the ping results are the same from the edge of your network, it will be necessary to investigate the issue with Oracle B2C Service and your Internet carrier. Troubleshooting external connectivity problems: Begin by performing multiple traceroutes to &lt;yoursite&gt;.custhelp.com. Five to ten traceroutes should be provided when submitting an incident to Oracle B2C Service in order to accurately portray any poor network behavior. Microsoft KB article 314868 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314868/EN-US/ explains how to use the tracert tool. Much of this is automated by the Workstation and Network Data Collector. Â For downloading Â and instructions for the data collector, refer to Answer ID 2412: Workstation and Network Data Collector. At this point it is often beneficial to analyze your available Internet bandwidth and utilization to ensure that your bandwidth is not over-utilized. Over-utilization is evidenced by dropped packets or highly variable response times. MRTG or other internal systems can be used to measure bandwidth consumption. Your Internet Provider may also be able to provide this data. Ping and traceroute tests are basic test that should be completed when network issues are suspected. Adequate performance of other Internet applications does not rule out connectivity problems. Once these problems are identified at the edge of your network and outside of any intermediate devices such as proxy servers and firewalls, it is important to engage Oracle B2C Service and your provider to ensure the issue is resolved."

Setting the Email Format value for Marketing contacts;Answer ID 2078;For Outreach and Feedback contacts, how are the Mail Type values set?;['Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   A contact's preferred mail type forÃ‚Â Outreach and FeedbackÃ‚Â E-mails.  NOTE  This answer onlyÃ‚Â applies to Outreach/Feedback mailings and doesÃ‚Â not apply to Service messages.;  When a contact record is added, either manually from the administration console or from the Data Import Wizard, the Email Format Â  Â field is null by default. As a result, the contact will receive Multipart / MIME email messages until the field is explicitly set to HTML or Text. The Email Format field can be populated through an import (contacts.ma_mail_type field) or be added to a contact workspace and set manually. You can create a contact business rule and use Email Format Preference as a condition, but not as an action. Data Import or Workspaces rules can be alternate solutions to setting this field if needed. For more information on rule conditions, refer to the 'Contact rulebase conditions' Â section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Directing an end-user to a specific page after logging in;Answer ID 2081;How do I create a link that requires a user to log in and then automatically directs them to a specific page?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Customer Portal (CP); You can redirect users to a specific page after logging in by modifying the login URL with additional parameters. Â  The specific parameters and method to use depend on which end-user pages are used with your site. With the CP pages, you can include the redirect parameter in the URL to direct users to a specific page after they have logged in. Upon logging in, the user is taken to the page you specify. For example, to direct users to the Ask a Question page after logging in, use the URL format: http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/utils/login_form/redirect/ask To link to a page that includes multiple directories, you must modify the redirected location by replacing each slash with %252F. Â  You cannot include the slash ( / ) in the redirect parameter. For example, to redirect a user to answer 103, you must indicate the appropriate directories for the answer location, namely answers/detail/a_id/103. Â  Â When creating the redirect parameter for the URL, replace each / with %252F to generate the URL below: Â  http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/utils/login_form/ redirect/answers%252Fdetail%252Fa_id%252F103 When the user logs in and the redirect occurs, the %252F is replaced with the slash ( Â / ) Â and the user is taken to: http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/103

Deleting a contact record but not the organization;Answer ID 2083;How do I delete a contact record but not the organization?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Contacts, Organizations, All versions;"  Use caution when deleting records from your Â Oracle B2C Service application. Within the product, there is no record restore feature. Once the record is deleted, you will be unable to restore that record to your site. Important! When you delete a contact record from your application, you also delete all incidents associated with that record. If you wish to retain the incidents for historical purposes, you can edit the record to disable it rather than deleting it. An organization record is essentially the parent of a contact record. Deleting the organization will delete all associated contacts and all incidents associated to those contacts. Â Deleting the contact will delete all associated incidents, but it will not delete the organization record. You can also delete a contact record when it is listed as a single record in a report. You cannot delete a contact when you have it open for editing. To delete a contact, use the steps below:  Run a report that lists individual contact records. Search for the contact record of interest so that it is returned in your report. Right click on the record and select Delete &gt; Contact or if the report options are expanded at the top of the report, select Delete &gt; Contact. Read the pop-up warning. If you wish to delete the record and all incidents where the contact is the primary contact for the incident, click Yes. To cancel, click No. If you delete the contact, the report automatically refreshes, so that it is no longer displayed in your report."

Sending scheduled reports in other formats;Answer ID 2084;I have scheduled several reports. Can I have them sent in other formats such as Excel, HTML, or PDF files?;['Answer ID 1796', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Scheduled Reports Oracle B2C Service;  Report subscriptions can be Â sent in Â HTML format using one of the following three options:  as an HTML attachment (with the images and charts in the report stored on the server) as an HTML email with the images and charts stored on the server as an HTML email with the images and charts sent in the email  Note: If the recipient may not have access to the server that stores the images and charts, it is best to use the format that includes the images and charts right in the email. You can also schedule reports to be sent as attachments to the email in the following formats:  Excel XLS attachment CSV attachment XML attachment Image attachment PDF attachment  Of the four formats above, only the Image and PDF Â attachment format allows charts and graphs to be sent. The Excel, CSV, and XML formats should not be used if you need to send a chart with the scheduled report. You can add scheduled reports by opening the report for editing and then selecting Scheduling in the Properties Â section of the Home ribbon. When you click the Add Scheduled Report link, set the Format field to determine how the report will be sent to your recipients.

Applying SLAs to several existing organizations or contacts;Answer ID 2086;How can I apply SLAs to several existing organizations? Do I have to edit each organization individually?;['Answer ID 1873'];  Service Level Agreements (SLAs); You can use rules to apply service level agreements (SLAs) to a contact record or organization record. This allows you to apply SLA instances automatically to contacts or organizations that meet specific criteria. You can also remove SLA instances using actions in a rule. If a contact is associated to an organization, the SLA MUST be applied to the organization record. The SLA can only be applied to a contact record if the contact is not associated with an organization record. Note: These steps associate an SLA to the contact or organization. This does not mean that the SLA is automatically associated to incidents submitted by that contact or organization. In cases where incidents need to be assigned to a specific SLA based on your support requirements, you can manually specify the SLA instance for an incident that is opened from the administration console, or you can use incident rules to apply the SLA instance to the incident based on criteria set for the incident (for example, based on custom fields).  Create Rules to Apply SLAs To apply SLAs to a group of organizations or contacts, you must first create a simple rulebase that includes a rule with an action that applies the SLA. Within your site, if contacts are associated to organizations, then you would set up organization rules to apply the SLA to the organization records. Otherwise, you would create a set of contact rules that would apply the SLA to the individual contact record. Once the rulebase is set up and activated, then you can multi-select several organizations or contact records and update those records so that they will match the rule. One approach is to create a custom field for your organization or contact records. In the rule, you can specify in the IF part of the rule that if the custom field equals a certain value, THEN the SLA should be applied. This allows you to specify right in the record whether or not the SLA should be applied. This also allows staff to easily see why an SLA may or may not have been applied to the record. Note: Setting up a rulebase for contacts or organizations is quite similar to the ruleset for incidents. Your ruleset must have an initial state and best practices strongly recommends that you transition all existing records into a non-initial rule state. Be sure to activate your rulebase.  Updating the Records With your rules in place, the next step is to update an initial test record. To do this, use a view or report Â that lists your organizations or contact records and search for at least one record of interest. Edit a record that you would like to apply the SLA instance to and set the organization or contact fields so that they will match the IF criteria set in your rule. If you wish, you can multi-select two records to ensure that multi-editing the records will trigger the rule to apply the SLAs. Then click Save. When the records are saved, they should match the rule and have the SLA instance applied (or removed). Verify this action by opening the record or records and checking the contents of the SLA field. In addition, use the Rule Log to determine if the incident hit the rule you were expecting. If the SLA was not applied as expected, use the Rule Log to determine which rules the record matched when it was updated. Note that when using the Rule Log with organization and contact records, you must use the record ID value. This is visible, with the record open, Â by clicking the Info icon from the top ribbon or hovering over the workspace tab. Â  Â For more information on the rule log, refer to Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log to troubleshoot rules. If the test records have the correct SLA instance applied, you can multi-select more organizations or contacts and edit the records so that they will be acted upon by the rule to apply the SLA. After you have edited the records that you need to, determine whether you should keep the rule or not. If this is not part of your long-term business process, edit your rules to delete or disable the rule and then click Activate to resave the rulebase.  Additional Considerations If the SLA is used to provide specific support features such as a limited number of incidents or specific response and resolutions times, you must also determine how the SLA instance is associated with the specific incident. Agents can assign the Â SLA to the incident Â manually or you can configure incident rules to set the SLA field in the incident based on specific criteria you configure.

Limit Buffer by option in rules;Answer ID 2094;What is Limit Buffer By, whenÃ‚Â creating rules?;['Answer ID 1873'];  Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;" The ""limit buffer by"" option appears when you create a rule that compares a string to any of the following: Incident Customer Thread Incident Staff Thread Incident Proposed Response Incident Summary This buffer allows you to specify, if desired, the number of characters in the Â thread, response or summary Â to compare against. If no Â value is entered, the entire thread is compared. If a value is entered, the first characters of the most recent entries will be used. Â  For example, let us say we have an incident as outlined below: Customer: Hello, I have a question about dogs. Staff: Thank you for your question. What breed? Customer: Doberman. If Â a rule was created Â and compared to the string ""hello"" Â in the Customer Thread Â and Â no Â buffer limit was specified, the rule will look for ""hello"" in the entire incident, will evaluate to true, and the 'Then' portion of the rule will execute. Â  If a Â buffer limit of 5 is specified, the rule will look for ""hello"" only in the first 5 characters, which is Â ""Dober,"" will evaluate to false, and the 'Else' portion of the rule will execute. If a buffer limit Â of 15 is Â specified, the rule will look for ""hello"" in ""Doberman. Hello"" will evaluate to true and the Â Then portion of the rule Â executes. Â  The system does count punctuation and spaces in its comparison as part of the buffer. Â  The maximum value accepted for the limit is 4000. Â  Â Also, if the limit is comparing multiple threads Â a character separator is used in between each thread processed and that counts as a space. Â  Â  This option is useful if you want to disregard the initial information in a thread, for example if the initial information is standard text, or for any other reason you wish to look at only the most recent information in a thread. Note: Please consider HTML usage. All HTML markup will be included in the buffer size."

Deleting service level agreements and SLA instances;Answer ID 2095;How can I delete service level agreements (SLAs). I can disable them, but cannot delete them.;['Answer ID 1873'];  Service Level Agreements (SLAs),; When working with service level agreements (SLAs), there is a cascading effect between the SLAs and the records within your Oracle B2C Service application.   First, an SLA must be created in the Service Level Agreements table Â and Â the Active checkbox must be enabled for the SLA. The Service Level Agreements table is accessed from the Service Administration / Configuration items. Â   Â   When an SLA is applied to organization or contact record, it is called an SLA instance. Â   Â   If a contact or organization has an SLA instance applied, then incidents associated with the contact or organization can have the SLA instance specified in the SLA field for that incident. When this occurs, the response requirements associated with the SLA instance are applied to that specific incident. Â   Â   Whether SLAs or SLA instances can be deleted depend on which version your site is on and Â how and where the SLA or SLA instance has been applied. Â   Â    Removing SLA Instances from Contacts or Organizations Once the SLA has been applied to a contact or organization record and the record has been saved, you cannot delete the SLA instance. You can disable the SLA instance, though, by unchecking the Â Active box next within the SLA instance. The only time you can delete an SLA instance is if you added it to a record and then decide to remove it before the record is saved. In that situation, you can click the Delete option next to the SLA instance in the pop-up window.  Deleting SLAs from the Service Level Agreements Table When working with SLAs defined in the Service Level Agreements table, whether the SLA can be deleted depends on whether it is applied to a contact or organization. If the SLA is associated to any contact or organization -- even in a disabled state -- then the SLA cannot be deleted. SLAs can only be deleted if it has never been applied and saved to a contact or organization record. Â  Once the SLA instance has been applied and saved to a record, you can only disable the SLA instance. As a result, the SLA cannot be deleted.

Some email messages are not being turned into incidents;Answer ID 2100;Why aren't all of my email messages being turned into incidents?;['Answer ID 2345', 'Answer ID 10338'];   Incoming emails;"  Oracle B2C Service Â includes several features that allow you to prevent incidents from being created. This includes settings designed to prevent email loops, specifying email addresses from which incidents will not be created, and rules that prevent incidents from being created under specific conditions. Evaluate the options and features below to determine if these are in place to prevent incidents from being created. Note: You can determine if an email was filtered using the standard report: ""Incoming Email Filter Details"" (report ID 227). This report is at the path: \Public Reports\Service\Email Reports. Note: In addition to the features and settings listed below, if your mailbox is hosted by Â Oracle, Â emails may be filtered or quarantined based on how the Barracuda filtering application is configured for the mailbox. For more information on how Barracuda filtering may be applied to your hosted mailbox, refer to Answer 2345: Barracuda Spam filters on hosted Service mailboxes. Configuration settings: The configuration settings included in the sections of this answer can be edited using the path below.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.          Amount of Email from an Address is Restricted: You can set configuration settings to allow a specified number of emails from an address within a specific timeframe.    By default, the system will only accept 23 messages from a given email address in a 12 hour period. If you use the default settings, the 24th and subsequent emails from that address within the 12 hour span will be discarded and no response email will be sent from the system.    The EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS  Â setting specifies the maximum number of emails that will be accepted from an individual email address within the time period specified in the EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION setting. This is used to identify and stop auto-responder email loops. Setting EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS to 0 disables the email loop detection. The default value is 23.    The EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION  Â setting specifies the number of hours to determine if an email loop is occurring. We recommend the duration not be less than 8 hours or more than 24 hours. The default value is 12 hours.    For example, if Â EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS is set to 23, and 24 emails are received from the same address within the EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION hours, the 24th email from that address will be discarded and no response email will be sent, thereby breaking the email loop. Â     Important! If you use forms to submit information and create incidents within your Oracle B2C Service application, incidents created from the form are all associated to the same contact record. As a result, if the form is used more than 23 times in a 12 hour period (if using the default settings), then the 24th and higher submittals will be discarded and no response sent.    Therefore, if you are using forms within your answers, you should set the EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS value to be 0 to disable the loop protection.       Note: These configuration settings are set at the per interface level. Â  Â However, they function as the maximum per mailbox associated to the interface the configurations are set.    To help illustrate the 'per mailbox' functionality:  - If a contact is sending 25 emails to the same mailbox (mailbox_id 1) within 12 hours, only 23 incidents will be created and the last 2 messages will be discarded;  - If a contact is sending 33 emails to 3 different mailboxes (10 emails to mailbox_id 1, 11 emails to mailbox_id 2 and 12 emails to mailbox_id 3) 33 incidents will be created and no email will be discarded.       See also Â Configurations EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS and EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION explained Â for more information.             Prevent Mailbox from Sending Email to Itself: The EGW_LOOP_PREVENT_ENABLED configuration setting allows you to prevent an Oracle hosted mailbox from sending messages to itself. When EGW_LOOP_PREVENT_ENABLED is enabled, any email where the reply-to email address matches the reply-to email address of any mailbox in Oracle B2C Service, it will be discarded and no incident will be created. In this way, the mailbox deletes any messages from itself, which can prevent continuous email loops. By default, this setting is enabled (set to Yes). Â                Message is Determined to be a Duplicate: The EGW_DISCARD_DUPLICATE_ENABLED Â  configuration setting allows you to discard emails that are determined to be duplicates. If enabled, any email having the same date within Â four hours, to and from email address (i.e. Sent to the same mailbox from the same sender), subject, and body as an existing incident will be classified as a duplicate message and will be discarded. Default is enabled (Yes).   NOTE: Beginning in the May 2015 release, the file attachment name, type, and size is also considered when processing potential duplicate messages. Â  In this same version, the specific mailbox is now ignored as a true duplicate could be sent to multiple configured mailboxes.   Examples:  - Two messages with the same from, to, subject, content, and file attachment. This should cause duplicate to be discarded.  - Two messages with the same from, to, subject, content, but for the file attachment, name them identically but be sure the sizes vary (easiest with text or word files, make one very long). This should not be considered a duplicate and should create two incidents in the system.            Email Matches Discard Addresses List or Discard Subject or Body Criteria: Check to see if the email address from which the email was sent is listed in the Discard Addresses filter for the mailbox. If so, then all messages from that address are simply discarded without creating an incident. Typically, email addresses are added to the Discard Addresses filter if they have been identified as sources of spam or junk email.    To check the discard addresses list, access the mailbox from the Service Configuration menu &gt; Communication Configuration &gt; Mailboxes table. Right click on the mailbox name and select Edit. Click the Incoming Email tab and review the email addresses listed in the Discard Addresses filter. If necessary, remove the email address and click Save.    Similarly, if words or phrases are listed in the Discard Subject or Discard Body fields, emails may be discarded if they contain a matching text sequence in the corresponding field.    Important! Emails are discarded based on whether the content matches any of the text strings entered and function similar to regular expressions in business rules.    For example, if you include the entry ""hat"" as criteria to discard the email in either the Discard Subject or Discard Body fields, an email will be discarded if it has a longer word or words that have ""hat"" in them -- even if the word ""hat"" itself is not in the email. If the email includes chat, what, hatch, and so on, the email is discard. For this reason, it is best to include longer words or phrases when adding content to these discard fields. Â                Review Business Rules: You can create a business rule to block returned messages so that the incident is not created. Review your business rules to see if any of the rules include the action ""Do not create incident"".    If there are rules in place that do not create incidents, consider disabling the rule to determine if the rule is deleting more email than was initially intended. Also, review the IF criteria in the rule to determine if that criteria is affecting more incoming email messages than was intended.   If you want to prevent incidents being created from reply email, use the following rule: IF Incident.Source equals Utilities -&gt; Techmail - Outreach Mailbox  THEN Do Not Create Incident.    Note: When disabling a rule, be sure to activate your ruleset after disabling the rule."

Determining our incident backlog;Answer ID 2101;How do I tell what our incident backlog is? ;['Answer ID 2345', 'Answer ID 10338'];   Analytics, Incidents, Analyzing Incident Backlog Oracle B2C Service  Issue   The Incident Trend Backlog report shows a number of incidents that seems way too high.;"  In the Oracle B2C Service application, the incident backlog is considered to be the total number of non-solved incidents Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that is, all incidents that are set to Unresolved or Waiting status types. Oracle B2C Service includes standard reports that include the incident backlog:        Incident Trend: Back Log: This report is accessed from the standard reports using the path: Reports &gt; Service folder &gt; Incident Reports &gt; Incident Trend &gt; Backlog. Â    Â        Operations Dashboard: The Operations Dashboard includes graphs for the Incident Backlog and the Backlog: Last 30 Days reports. This report is accessed from the Analytics Console using the path: Reports &gt; Service folder &gt; Site Reports &gt; Operations Dashboard folder &gt; Operations Dashboard.     In the Incident Trend &gt; Backlog report, the totals generated are as of midnight on the specified day. Therefore, the backlog number reported includes all incidents that are assigned to a status that is a Waiting status type in addition to incidents assigned to an Unresolved status type. Note that the Incident Trend &gt; Backlog report is a cached report. Data for a given day is not available until after midnight, when it is cached by the agedatabase utility. The data this report retrieves is stored in a database table. As a result, the statistics for a particular day is not affected by changes to incidents in the database, such as an incident being deleted. Similarly, the Backlog: Last 30 Days graph in the Operations Dashboard report uses the same cached data as the Incident Trend: Backlog report. However, within the Operations Dashboard report, the Backlog report is a real-time report where the data reported is determined directly from the incidents table. This report simply counts the total number of incidents that are set to an Unresolved or Waiting status type at the moment the report is run. To view the actual backlog incidents: You can create a custom report or Â view that uses a filter on the incident status type so that only incidents with an Unresolved or Waiting status type are included in the search results. If you wish, you can add additional filters based on staff group or other fields of interest."

Additional number included in email responses;Answer ID 2107;Our outgoing email responses to our customers include an unusual number at the bottom of the message, similar to the following: [---001:000476:29673---];['Answer ID 2017', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Email Gateway, Outgoing email messages Oracle B2C Service;" When the reply-between-the-lines feature is disabled, a byte count is included in text email that contain incident responses. This byte count is necessary when the EGW_REPLY_BETWEEN_ENABLED configuration setting is disabled or the mailbox configured does not force the reply-between-the-lines feature. Note: The byte count is only included in text email messages. If the response email message is sent as HTML, the byte count is not required and the byte count does not display at the bottom of the HTML-enabled email messages. To check the configuration of the messages, From the Configuration items, select Site Configuration &gt; Messages. The byte count is used to determine the amount of content in the original message so that when the customer replies to the email, there is an indication of whether part of the update was entered above the response or whether part of the reply was entered inline within the original block of the response that was sent. If the customer replies and enters content within the original block of the response, then the byte count changes and the entire response is updated within the incident. If the contact only adds a reply above the original response, the byte count does not change and only the content above the original response is updated in the incident. For more information on the byte count, refer to Answer ID 2017: Removing Reply-Between-the-Lines from Emails. Comprehensive information about this functionality is also included in the RightNow Documentation. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Rules are not acting on updated records;Answer ID 2111;When we add or update certain records, the rules do not act on the record.Ã‚Â  Why aren't the rules taking effect?;['Answer ID 1873', 'Answer ID 723'];  Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;" If you suspect that rules are not acting on records when they are created or updated, review the Â possible causes listed Â below.  Check the Rule State for the Record For records that have been imported into your site, the most common cause for rules not acting on a record is that the record Â was imported with a Â null rule state. This can happen when contact records are added using the Data Import Wizard or when records are imported or created from an integration. If a record has a null rule state, the record is not compared to any rules when it is updated. Â  Â When the record is updated and saved, the record remains with a null rule state and is not acted on. For example, if you import a group of contact records without setting a rule state in the .csv file, the records are created with a null state. To determine the rule state for a record: Open the Â record and review the information in the Information pop-up. From the open record, click the Info button in the toolbar. Note that the fields listed on the Info button can be customized in the workspace. Â  If the rule state is not listed, review the configuration of the workspace you are using. Â   Â  To resolve this issue: Activate the rule base. When the rule base is activated, you will get a message indicating that there are X number of records with a null rule state. At that point, set which rule state those records should be set to and continue activating your rules. Â  Â The records will be set to the rule state but will not be compared to the rules for that rule state since the records were not actually edited or updated to trigger the rules. Then, evaluate the process for importing or creating those types of records. Â  Â Determine which rule state should be set when the records are imported or created and make that part of the import / creation process. That way, the records have the correct rule state so that when they are updated, the rules will act on the records as you expect.  Check the Rule Log Use the Rule Log to see which rules (if any) Â did act on the record when it was last saved. Â  For more information on the Rule Log, refer to Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log to Troubleshoot Rules. Note: When you run the rule log, you can right click on the Rule Log tab and select Open in New Window. This allows you to see the rule log output side-by-side while reviewing the active ruleset. Next, view the active ruleset. Select Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Rules. Viewing the active ruleset allows you to Â determine which rule or rules you expected to act on the record when it was saved. Â  Compare the results of the rule log to determine which rules were actually hit and why the rule you expected to match did not. Some common reasons that rules act differently than expected are: The record unexpectedly matched a rule that is higher in the list.  Â  The record did not match the criteria set in the rule that you expected it to match.  Â  The rulebase was Â edited Â to add new rules, Â but they did not actually get Â activated after Â they were edited.  Â  The record has a rule state different from what you expect. Â  That is, the record never transitioned to the rule state you expected.  For more information as to why a rule does not seem to be working properly, refer to Answer ID 723: Our new rule is not working correctly."

Staff member cannot log in to the administration console;Answer ID 2114;We have a staff member who cannot log in to the Oracle B2C Service application. What can we look at?;['Answer ID 2176', 'Answer ID 31'];   Workstation, Environmental, Profiles, Accounts;"  Several items and features listed below affect whether staff members can successfully log in to the Oracle B2C Service application. Review the following items to Â determine why staff members may be unable to log in to your application: Staff Account Verify that a staff account exists within your application for that staff member and that the staff account is not disabled or locked. For more information on locked staff accounts, refer to Answer ID 2176: Re-enabling Locked Staff Accounts. Note that having a contact record in your site does not automatically create a staff account. Contact records with logins and passwords allow the contact to access the Account section of your end-user pages, but does not allow access to the administration consoles. Â  .NET Installed Verify that .NET is installed on the staff member's machine. Please ensure that the latest available version of .NET is installed on the workstation. For more information Â regarding supported Â .NET framework, see the Workstation Requirements in Â Answer ID 31: Oracle B2C Service Infrastructure Requirements for your versions. Profile Allows Access to Interface Verify that the staff profile allows access to the interface that the agent is trying to log into. From the Configuration menu, select Staff Management &gt; Account Profiles and right click on the profile name to open it for editing. Make sure that the interface of interest is enabled (highlighted). Â  Pop-up Blockers If a pop-up blocker is enabled on a machine, the user can enter a login and password but then nothing else will happen except the bottom left corner of the browser will display the message Done. Several features in the Oracle B2C Service application use pop-up windows, so it is important that staff members either turn off pop-up blockers or ""whitelist"" the Oracle B2C Service applications so that the pages of your application are not blocked. To determine if a pop-up blocker is installed on a machine, go to a site that you know has a pop-up when you first access the site. For example, you can go to CNN's home page (http://www.cnn.com/), which has an initial pop-up window, to see if the pop-up appears on the staff member's machine. If not, then, the pop-up blocker is still in effect or there is a secondary pop-up blocker at work. Â  Permission Denied Error Some users may get a permission denied error when they try to open a console. In this case, check your internet options on the machine. The Userdata Persistence option should be enabled.  Â  To check the value of the Userdata Persistence setting, use the path: Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Security tab &gt; Custom Level button &gt; Miscellaneous header &gt; Userdata Persistence. Â  Could not switch to locking process Error This can occur if multiple RightNow.CX.exe processess are running. Â  If the previous session did not close correctly, this will leave a process running and can prevent a successful login. Â   Â  To correct this, open the Task Manager (crtl+alt+del) and select the Processes tab. Search this list and end all RightNow.CX.exe processes. Â  Re-launch the application to login Â successfully. Â  Â   If additional assistance is required, please submit an incident to Oracle B2C Service Technical Support via the Â Ask Support page."

Default start and end points when using weeks in a report;Answer ID 2116;When creating a report, what are the default start/end points of a week? Is it Sunday through Saturday or Monday through Sunday?;['Answer ID 1796'];  Analytics Oracle B2C Service, All versions; When running a report that groups data using a week interval, the interval begins on Sunday and goes through Saturday. If your organization uses Monday through Sunday as a week, you can get an individual week's results by defining date ranges using relative dates and the rounding function. That is, you can have a report generate the data from last Monday through the following Â Sunday. For example, you can add a scheduled report for the Service Summary or Answers Viewed reports to include data from the previous Monday through Sunday only. To get a week's worth of data from Monday through Sunday, you can configure a scheduled report to be sent on Monday. For the date range filter, you can configure the scheduled report to use the filter values to be: -7 Days Rounded (with Relative box enabled) to Â  0 Days Rounded (with Relative box enabled) When the report is scheduled to be run on Monday, the filter retrieves data back to the previous Monday (- 7 days) and rounds down to the beginning of that day (to midnight). The upper end of the range is rounded to the beginning of that day (-0 days) so that data until midnight Sunday night is included in the report. Note: Â  In order to define filter values for scheduled reports, the filter must be a run-time filter. Â  If using fixed filters, set the fixed filter to use a relative data range from -7 days rounded to 0 days rounded and then schedule the report to run each Monday. To schedule a report to include one week from Monday through Sunday, use the steps below. Â  By having the report sent each Monday and using the filters set to capture the last seven days of data grouped by month, the report will include only the last seven days worth of data grouped together in one data point. For more information on configuring report subscriptions, refer to Answer ID 1796: Subscribe People to Receive Reports. To edit scheduled report filtering: Open the report for editing and from the Properties tab, click Scheduling.  Â  In the pop-up window, click Add Schedule.  Â  In the New Schedule window, click the Use Defaults link next to Filter Values.  Â  In the pop-up window, enable the Relative boxes for both ends of the date range.  Â  Set the lower value of the date range to Â -7 Days Rounded.  Â  Set the upper value of the date range to 0 Days Rounded.  Â  Set the Date Grouping field to be Year or Year/Month. This allows the data Â to be grouped together in one data point.  Â  Click OK to close the filter window.  Â  Finish configuring the fields in the New Schedule window and click OK.  Â  From the Schedules window, click OK and save your report.

Determining which contacts and organizations have SLAs applied;Answer ID 2119;How can I determine which of our contact and organization records have service level agreements (SLAs) applied to them?;['Answer ID 1796'];  Analytics, Service Level Agreement (SLA) Oracle B2C Service; To determine which SLA instances have been applied to contacts or organizations, you can create custom reports that join the sla_instances database table to the contacts or organizations table. For example, to determine which contact records have SLA instances applied to them, you can create a custom report similar to the following: Data Set: sla_instances joined to the contacts table  Â  Run-time Selectable Filters: sla_instances.state in list Any (allows you to filter for active SLAs or disabled SLAs if necessary) sla_instances.sla_id (allows you to report on specific SLA names of interest)  Â  Output Columns: contacts.full_name -- contact's first and last name sla_instances.sla_id -- the name of the SLA sla_instances.slai_id -- the database ID for the SLA instance sla_instances.state -- whether the SLA is active, disabled, not ready or used up sla_instances.activedate -- date the SLA instance was applied  If you are using organization records, then the SLA instance must be applied to the organization record, so you could create a similar report as above except you would use the organizations table instead of the contacts table.

Incidents created with winmail.dat or Rfc822/rtf file attachment;Answer ID 2122;Why do some incidents have a winmail.dat or an Rfc822 or rtfÃ‚Â file attachment associated with it?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 1796'];   Incidents, Incoming Email Oracle B2C Service;  Incidents are created with a winmail.dat or an Rfc822/rtf file attachment under the following conditions. Â  The incident itself will either be blank or have extraneous code in the body.  The incident is created from an email sent to a Oracle-managed mailbox.  Â  The sender uses Microsoft Outlook as their email client and an Â Outlook client or Exchange server Â is configured to send Rich Text Formatted (RTF) only messages.  Under these conditions, when the email is sent, the winmail.dat or Rfc822/rtf file is sent along with the email. The Â files contains special formatting information that is only recognized by other Outlook email clients. Â  Please note that, Rich Text is a Microsoft proprietary format that is largely unsupported by other email clients, including Oracle B2C Service. Here is a wiki link that discusses Microsoft's propriety format: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Neutral_Encapsulation_Format This issue is addressed in more detail in Microsoft knowledge article 278061 Â for Â Outlook 2002 and 2003. Please refer to Winmail.dat sent as an email attachment in Outlook 2007 and 2010 Â for newer versions. To help improve your experience with these file attachment types, just like opening a .docx file, Â which requires that you have Word installed, it is dependent on the machine to be able to support the ability to decode and view the contents of the file attachment. Â  Â To resolve this, you need to have Â the appropriate software (ie, a winmail.dat reader or other internal or third party tool) that would allow you to open these files.

Changes to rules did not take effect;Answer ID 2123;I just modified our rules, but the changes did not take effect. Why?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 5168'];   Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;"  When you edit business rules, you are actually working in a copy of the rulebase. Until that copy is activated, the existing rulebase is used for handling records. This allows you to add, remove, and edit rules within the copied rulebase without automatically enabling your changes into your production environment.  View Active ruleset: To view the rules that are acting on your site, select the View Active option for the type of rules of interest. For example, to view the active incident rules, use the path: Service Administration / Configuration menu &gt; Rules &gt; Incident &gt; View Active. To view opportunity rules, use the path: Sales Administration / Configuration menu &gt; Rules &gt; Opportunity &gt; View Active. When viewing your active ruleset, you can not edit the rules in any way.  Edit ruleset: From the Administration Console, when you select the Edit option (instead of View Active) for a rule type, you are working in a copy of the rulebase. The right frame gives an indication of when the copy was created and when it was last updated and by whom. When you edit the copy of the rulebase, your changes are saved within the copy. These edits, though, are not automatically implemented as part of the rules that act on your records. The next time you go to the Edit mode of the rules, the copy of the rulebase will display and the content will be as you last saved the rules within that copy. As a result, the Edit mode of your rules may be different than the actual rulebase that is acting on records in your database.  Activating the ruleset: In order for the edits to your rules to take effect, you must activate the edited ruleset.  From the Edit mode of your rules, edit the ruleset as necessary to add, disable, or delete rules and functions as appropriate.  Â  Save the edited copy of the rules.  Â  Click Activate. When the rulebase is activated, the Â active rulebase is overwritten with your new, edited rules. Â  If the Activate button is not active in the editor, check to see if the rule has been disabled. Â  A lock icon appears next to a rule to reflect its disabled status. Â  The menu option changes to Enable when you right-click a disabled rule.  Â  If you have records (incidents, opportunities, answers, contacts, or organizations) that do not have a rule state applied to them, you will be asked if you want to assign them to a rule state so that those records will be compared to the rules for that state the next time the records are edited or updated.  To assign records with a null rule state, select the appropriate rule state and continue activating the ruleset. Otherwise, set the menu to Null and continue activating the ruleset.  Clearing your edited ruleset: If you determine that the changes you made to your rules (in the copied rulebase) should not be implemented, click the Abandon button to delete the copy of the rulebase. You can then click the Edit mode for your rules to create a new copy of the active Â rulebase and proceed from there.  For additional information, refer to the 'About Business Rule Management' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Changing the font display of incident threads in the console;Answer ID 2128;CanÃ‚Â agentsÃ‚Â increase the font size of incidents as they are working on them?;['Answer ID 9082', 'Answer ID 9633'];  Workspaces Oracle B2C Service, All supported versions; When working with incidents in the Oracle B2C Service console, each staff member can modify the text size for Â their incidents. When editing incidents, the incident toolbar includes a plus and minus icon Â to the far right. Clicking either one will increase or decrease font size accordingly. Changing the font size applies to all thread types within the incident being edited. Â  In addition, when opening another incident, the font size defaults to the last font size selected. Â  That is, if you increase Â the font size in one incident and then close it, when you open another incident, the font size remains at the increased size.

Evaluating tracked link usage in Outreach mailings;Answer ID 2139;For our Outreach mailings, how can we determine which tracked links were clicked most and by whom?;['Answer ID 9082', 'Answer ID 9633'];   Outreach and Feedback, Mailings Oracle B2C Service;"  When Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service is enabled, several system-defined reports are available to evaluate how tracked links within your mailings are used. This allows you to determine which types of tracked links are clicked most frequently. You can also view which contacts clicked which links in a specific document. From the mailing itself, you can click the Results tab to Â view the number of clicks and unique clicks for each tracked link in the mailing.  The Tracked Link Activity report is embedded on the Results tab. This report lists the tracked links from your mailing and includes both the total number of clicks and the number of unique clicks (from different contacts).   The Click-Through Activity report is at the bottom of the Results tab. This lists all clicks from the mailing, including tracked links and unsubscribe, forward to a friend and other form links. Â  Click View Results to see the mailed document along with statistics for each link in the document. The numerator indicates how many recipients clicked that link and the denominator indicates the number of recipients.  In addition, several Â system-defined reports associated with tracked link activity are located in a single Outreach folder. To access these reports use the path: Reports Explorer &gt; Outreach folder &gt; Tracked Links folder.  Tracked Link Activity Drilldown: this report displays the tracked links in a specific mailing and the total and unique clicks for each link. In addition, you can double-click on the row Â to view which contacts clicked that tracked link.   Tracked Link Activity Over Time: this report Â displays the total and unique Â clicks for Â tracked links for a specific time period across multiple mailings. Â  This allows you to see link activity for all links for a set time period.   Web Traffic Summary: Â  this report lists the total and unique clicks for tracked links for a specific time period you select. Â Total and unique clicks are reported Â based on the Tracked Link categories configured for your site. This allows you to compare clicks across the categories you have defined. Then, you can drill down into a specific sub-category and ultimately drill down the specific tracked links."

Viewing incidents for other designated contacts on the Oracle B2C Service Support site;Answer ID 2140;As a designated contact, how can I view service requests that are associated with other contacts for our organization?;['Answer ID 9082', 'Answer ID 9633'];  Oracle B2C Service Support Site, Service Requests (SRs);" The Oracle B2C Service Support site is configured to allow designated contacts the ability to view all service requests associated to their organization record. This includes viewing service requests for other designated support contacts and viewing ones submitted from former contacts that have been disabled. To view all service requests associated with your organization: 1. Â  Â Click the My Â Account Â link followed by Â clicking the Service Requests link. 2. Â  Â Above the table of service requests, change the Display menu to ""From anyone in My Organization"". Updating other contacts' service requests: Â  If the SR is recent enough, when you view the specific SR, you can click on the Subject link and add content to the thread. If the SR has been set to a Solved status for more than 30 days, the Update Question button does not display. If you update another contact's SR, you are not automatically added as a secondary contact for the SR and will not automatically be copied on responses sent for that record. Therefore, if you update another person's SR, add a comment to the thread requesting that you be added as a secondary contact or be added to the CC field. Disabled contact records: Â  If a designated contact has been disabled, SRs associated to the disabled contact remain associated to the disabled contact record. It is not Oracle B2C Service's policy to automatically reassign SRs to other active contacts. Leaving the SR Â assigned to the original contact is a better reflection of the SR history for the organization. In cases where you need to update an existing SR for a contact that has been disabled, add a comment to the thread to request that the SR be reassigned to you so that you can take over ownership of specific SRs that need further assistance from our Technical Support team."

Deleting an organization in Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 2150;How do I delete an organization in my Oracle B2C Service application?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Organizations, All versions;" IMPORTANT! It is very important to understand that deleting an organization affects many other records that are tied to that organization record. When you delete an organization, you permanently delete not only the organization record itself, but you also delete all contact records that are associated with the organization -- which also deletes their incidents. Deleting an organization also permanently deletes sales opportunities that are associated to the organization. Deleting an organization, permanently deletes the following items from your database:   All contacts that are associated to the organization Â   Â   All incidents that are associated with the organization's contacts are also deleted Â   Â   All sales opportunities and tasks that are associated to the organization Â   Â   Only staff members whose profiles allow them to delete organization records have the ability to delete these records. The ability to delete organizations is configured on the Organization tab of the staff profile's Permissions options. Before you delete an organization: be sure to review all contacts, incidents, opportunities, and tasks. It may be necessary to associate records with a different contact or organization before you delete the organization of interest. To delete the organization record: After you have reviewed the contacts, incidents, opportunities, and tasks associated with the organization and determine that the organization record can be deleted, use the steps below. From the Reports Explorer or your navigation items, select a report that allows you to search by organization. Â   Â  From the Support or Sales Console, select a report that allows you to search by organization. Â   Â  Click the Search button to search for the organization by name. Â   Â  In the search results, highlight the row that corresponds to the organization you wish to delete. If there are multiple organizations listed, be sure you select the correct record. It may be necessary to open the organization record to determine which specific record you have selected and to verify that you have highlighted the correct record. Â   Â  After verifying that you have selected the correct organization record, close the organization record (if you opened it for review). Â   Â  From the report, right click on the organization and select Delete &gt; Organization. Â   Â  A pop-up window will display asking for verification that you want to delete the organization and associated contacts, incidents, and opportunities. Click Yes to delete the record(s).

Incident record locking when someone has them open for editing;Answer ID 2152;"When working on an incident, is the incident ""locked"" so that no one else can open it for editing?";['Answer ID 1843'];  Record Locking Oracle B2C Service, All versions;" Incidents are not locked when someone has the incident open for editing. That is, multiple staff members can open the same records to be edited. This functionality is by design based on the factors listed below:   Minimal Impact of Multiple Users: The effect of multiple users editing the same incident is minimized. In previous versions, when a record was edited, all data in the page was saved to the database, regardless of whether the value was changed or not. Only edited data is updated in the database. As a result, even if two users edit the same incident, conflicts will only arise if they change the same field. Each save is recorded, so the value will reflect the value of whoever last saved the record. If multiple users add thread entries such as an incident response or an internal note, each entry will be added to the thread in chronological order. There is no conflict possible on threads. Â   Â   Contact and Org Records Also Open: When an incident is opened for editing, the corresponding contact record is opened for editing as well. If you open a child record such as a contact or org record, those records are also opened. If Â the Organization feature is used, then the organization records and all associated contacts are also opened for editing. This is what allows agents to easily access and update information for contacts and organizations at the same time the incident is being edited. If locks were implemented, having multiple records open in this way would result in showing many lock warnings to agents -- especially when agents are working on incidents submitted from the same organization. As a result, from initial testing, we determined that agents were overriding locks and that the lock warning were frequently ignored, which defeats the usefulness of the feature.  Â   Queues and Inbox Features: The queue feature is designed so that agents pull incidents to fill their Inbox with incidents. As a result, staff members work the incidents assigned directly to them. When an agent needs more incidents to work, they simply pull incidents from the queue. In previous versions, the only way to distribute new incidents to agents was to use automatic group assignment or have the agents work new incidents from a common view. By having the agents pull incidents from a queue instead of from a console view, the incident is worked by the assigned agent, which eliminates the need for locking. One additional advantage of using queues is that incidents are assigned and worked in priority order, based on either the time received or by some other user specified priority. For more information on setting up queues, refer to Answer ID 1843: Routing incidents to staff members based on queues.   Given the functionality in Oracle B2C Service, a best practice that we recommend is that staff should never edit an incident that is not assigned to them, and should never take an incident from another agent without prior approval. Agents should only work incidents that are assigned to them, either manually or by pressing the Fill Inbox icon. This practice removes the need for incident locking. Note: You can manually assign an incident to a staff member without opening the incident for editing. Right click on the incident and select Assign &gt; Incident and select the staff member."

Using a severity field with Oracle B2C Service;Answer ID 2155;How can we add a severity field to our Service site?;['Answer ID 1131'];   Incident Routing;"  You can use the system-defined Severity field with incidents in your Oracle B2C Service site. This allows agents to set the internal severity of the incidents they handle. Note: Â  The Severity field only displays on the administration side of the application. It cannot be configured to display on the end-user pages. In order for the Severity field to display to agents, make sure that the incident workspace used by your agents includes the Severity field. To add menu options to the Severity field, use the steps below:  From the Configuration Items, Â go to Application Appearance &gt; Customizable Menus &gt; System Menus &gt; Â Incident Severity.   To add an incident severity, click the New button on the ribbon. Or to edit an incident severity, click it in the tree.   Enter the text for the severity level you are adding and enable the Visibility checkbox for the interfaces where you want that value to display in the Severity field and click Save.   Add additional severity levels as you deem necessary.   Click the Save and Close button on the ribbon to save the incident severities and close the editor.  Â  To determine which incident workspace is used, you may need to open the staff profile and click the Service tab to see which incident workspace is listed.  To include a severity field on the Ask a Question page: Â  You must define an incident custom field and enable it for end-user visibility. For more information on adding custom fields, refer to Answer ID 1131: Adding Custom Fields. Note: After creating the custom field with end-user visibility enabled, that field will display on the end-user Ask a Question page. Â  In order for your staff to view the custom field, you must add the custom field to the incident workspaces used by your staff. With the custom field in place, you can review the severity as established by your end-users. Â  If you also use the system-defined Severity field, you can then run reports that include both the end-user severity (from the custom field) and the agent-assessed severity (from the system-defined field). Â  If there are significant differences between the two severity values, you may need to communicate more clearly what types of issues match which types of severity. In other cases, you may need to reassess how you categorize specific issues. Perhaps an issue is more severe and has more impact to your end-users than you initially thought."

Chat agent statuses in Chat;Answer ID 2156;What are the chat agent statuses?;['Answer ID 2799', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle Service Chat;"  A chat agentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status describes the agentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s availability to the supervisor and other agents in Chat. While working in Chat, agents can change their status. Oracle Service Chat has five default chat agent statuses, all of which are associated with the Available or Unavailable status type:  Unrestricted: Â indicates that there are no restrictions to an agentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s availability to chat. This status has an Available status type associated with it. Â  Unqualified: Â indicates that the agent did not specify a reason for being unavailable to chat. This status has an Unavailable status type associated with it. Â  In Meeting: Â indicates that the agent is in a meeting and is not Â available to chat. This status has an Unavailable status type associated with it. Â  On Break: Â indicates that the agent is on a break and is not available to chat. This status has an Unavailable status type associated with it. Unspecified: indicates that the agent is logged out of Chat. This status does not display to the staff on the Agent Status drop-down menu.  These default statuses cannot be deleted. You also cannot change the status type associated with these statuses.  Adding custom statuses: Â  The five default chat agent statuses may be enough for your organization. However, if additional chat agent statuses will help you more accurately determine the status of agents, you can add them. When you add a chat agent status, you must assign it to one of the two default status types - Available or Unavailable. To add or edit a chat agent status, use the steps below:  Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Customizable Menus System Menus &gt; Chat Agent Statuses Select New from the top ribbon to add a custom status Enter a label value Â (display name) Select the status type from the drop down (Available or Unavailable) Save  Answer ID 2799: Chat agent status set in profile Â provides information on Â associating chat statuses with agent profiles.

Copying an answer;Answer ID 2162;How do I copy an answer in our site?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, Answer Workspace Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Copying an Answer Â as a Stand-alone Answer Â  You can copy an answer so that the new answer is a stand-alone answer and is not a sibling to the answer that is copied. That is, the new answer has its own meta-answer ID and can be assigned products and categories independently from the original answer. In the report grid, right click on the answer to be copied. In the Copy Answer pop-up window, make sure the Â Create Sibling Relationship check box is clear. Then, set the Access Level, Language, and Status fields as you wish and specify whether file attachments should be copied and click OK. The new answer opens for editing. If the NUM_0_COPY_OF_ANSWER_1_LBL message base Â is set to blank, then no Ã¢â‚¬Å“(Copy of Answer #)Ã¢â‚¬Â is appended to the subject on copy. Â  In versions prior to May 2009, the summary of the new answer uses the summary of the original answer and then appends (Copy of Answer X) at the end of the summary so that you can easily distinguish the source of the answer from the original. See the Â 'Copy a record' section in current documentation for more information.  Copying an Answer as a Sibling to an Existing Answer  The Copy Answer feature in Oracle B2C Service is designed to allow you to create sibling answers that are used with the privileged access feature and also with sites that have multiple interfaces that use different languages. Copying an existing answer allows you to create a basis from which to edit or translate the sibling answer. Since both the original answer and its copy / sibling are in the same meta-answer, you can group your answers in a view by the meta-answer ID. In general, when copying an answer, it is best to use a report or view that allows you to search by the meta-answer ID and includes the meta-answer ID as a column in the view grid. This allows you to find your new answer more easily by searching on the meta-answer of the original answer. Multiple Languages: You can copy the existing answer from your original interface so that staff working in the secondary interface can easily see the content of the answer that needs to be translated. When you copy an answer that is to be used with another language, you are responsible for providing the translation for the content itself.  Sibling answers are listed on the Relationships tab. Â If the Siblings section does not display on the Relationships tab, check the Answers workspace and make sure the SiblingsVisible property for the Answer Relationships item is set to TRUE. To copy an answer so that the new answer is a is a sibling of the existing answer, use the steps below.  In the report grid, right click on the answer to be copied. Â   Â  In the Copy Answer pop-up window, make sure the Â Create Sibling Relationship check box is clear. Â   Â  Then, set the Access Level, Language, and Status fields as you wish and specify whether file attachments should be copied and click OK.  The new answer opens for editing. The summary of the new answer uses the summary of the original answer and then appends (Copy of Answer X) at the end of the summary so that you can easily distinguish the source of the answer from the original.

When added, sibling answers are listed and can be opened for editing.  Â  On the Files / Attachments tab, a section with the heading Attachments for this answer and all sibling answers can be enabled for display using the Siblings Visible option on the Design ribbon. Â  When enabled, two sections for attachments display on the tab.  Â  The top section appends files to the individual answer that is being edited. The lower section appends files to display with the answer being edited AND all of its sibling answers.  Â  On the Audit Log tab, a section with the heading Transactions that affect this answer Â and all sibling answers is part of the Audit Log Relationship Item. Â Once added, two sections display on the Audit Log tab.  Â  Edits to the individual answer, including edits to the answer content and custom fields, are included in the top section on the Audit Log tab. Edits to the products and categories -- which are shared among siblings -- are listed as edits in the lower section on the tab.  Display options: Â  Â The Siblings Visible property associated with the relationship item on the Attachments tab of the workspace can be set to the following options: True -- display the sibling feature for all answers, even for answers that have no siblings.  Â  False -- do not display the sibling feature for any answer, even Â if the Â answer Â has siblings. On the default workspaces, the Relationships and Audit Log are already added so that the sibling sections display all the time. The Â Attachments tab default is Â false so that the sibling section is not visible on the tabs. Modifying sibling properties: Â  To enable the sibling information (if not already enabled) Â on the Attachments tab to display with an answer, you must enable the Siblings Visible property in the answer workspace.

Updating sibling answers across multiple interfaces;Answer ID 2165;I have copied the same answer to display for our different interfaces. Is there a way to update them all at the same time?;['Answer ID 2451'];  Answers, Analytics; When you update an answer, your edits are not automatically updated into the sibling answers that you copied from it. Each individual answer must be edited separately in order to update the content across your copied answers. If the content of the multiple answers is identical and each answer is merely displayed in different interfaces: You can configure your site so that the one answer will display to the multiple interfaces instead of creating multiple answers. That way, when you update the individual answer, the update will display in all of the interfaces where the answer is published. You can do this by assigning the single answer to multiple products, categories and/or access levels that are enabled for visibility on the interfaces you wish to publish the answer to. That is, the answer must be assigned to at least one product and category that is visible to interface 1 and at least one product and category that is visible to interface 2. If different access levels are used, you can save the answer to multiple access levels, so you would save the answer to both of the access levels for interface 1 and interface 2. When publishing answers, five conditions must be met in order for the answer to appear on the end-user pages of a particular interface: The Product, Category, and Access Level must be enabled for end-user visibility for the interface. Â   Â  The Language field of the answer must be the same as the language used for the interface. Â   Â  The Status must be a public status type. Therefore, with multiple interfaces, you can save the answer to multiple products and categories and to multiple access levels so that the answer will display on the different interfaces. If the answer must contain different information for different interfaces, or be presented in a different format: You can use meta-answers as the container for these similar answers. When you copy an answer, the copy can be created as a sibling answer. Sibling answers share the same meta-answer. As a result, the meta-answer / sibling relationship Â groups the different versions of the same answer together. In this case, if you update one of the answers, it will only update the content of that individual answer. You would then need to separately edit the other answers to update that content as well. To find answer related to the same meta-answer: Â You can create an answer report using the meta-answers and answers tables. In addition, sibling answers that belong to the same meta-answer are listed on the Relationships tab when editing answer. This allows you to easily see which answers you need to evaluate based on your edits.

For information on this setting, refer to Answer ID 605: Setting the time zone in Oracle B2C Service. Customers can submit chat requests during the designated work hours. If all agents are busy, the customer will be placed in a queue for the next available agent. For users that Â are waiting in Â the queue Â just prior to the end of Â chat hours, their sessions will not end. Â  Â They will wait in the queue as per your normal business processes. Â  Â If a customer submits a request after Â the end of Â the designated Â chat hours, Â the enduser pages reflect that Chat is unavailable. Â  This prevents Â new requests from coming in Â after close of business.

Customizing search results and reports in a workspace;Answer ID 2169;Can we customize the default reports and search results used in our workspaces?;['Answer ID 2518'];Workspaces;" Within the default workspaces, reports are included in specific relationship items or are associated with specific fields or functions. For example, in a contact workspace, Â the Incident View relationship item includes a report that is customizable. Relationship items use reports in one of Â three primary ways  The report is embedded on a tab. For example, from a contact record, when you click the Incidents tab, the display of incidents is controlled by a report. Â  Similarly, from an opportunity workspace, the Tasks and Quotes tabs use a report to display records.  Â  The report is used with specific search fields. Â  When added to a workspace, certain fields include a magnifying glass next to them which indicates that you can search the database for a specific record of that type. For example, when creating a new incident or opportunity, the Contact and Organization fields include the magnifying glass. When you click the magnifying glass, the search pop-up uses a report.  Â  The report is used with a specific button and function in the workspace. Â  Some relationship items include buttons that allow searching. These buttons use a report for the search. For example, on the Incident Thread relationship item, the Search Knowledgebase button is associated to a report. Â  Â With the Contacts relationship item, the Add button is associated to a report.  You can customize the reports used in a workspace. The report used with a field or item Â in the workspace is Â configured as part of the properties for that item. Â  Â When the tab, Â field, or relationship item Â is selected, the properties below indicate which report to use for specific functionality: Report property: Â  Specifies the report Â used to display records on a tab.  Â  Search Report property: Â  Specifies the report Â used to search for records associated with that item. Â  Â  Â   Â  Secondary Search Report property: Specifies a second search report Â that can be included in the search pop-up window. This report is included beneath the primary search report that is listed in the Search Report property. This allows you to define an additional list of records to view when searching for the record of interest or reviewing records listed on a tab. For more information on editing workspace properties, refer to Answer ID 2518: Setting Properties in Workspaces. Some features in the workspace may have only one of these properties, while other items may have all three properties. For example, the Contacts relationship item has all three properties: The Report property Â defines the columns displayed for contacts listed on the tab.  Â  The Contacts item also has a Search Report property that is used when a staff member clicks the Add button and selects Add Existing.  Â  The Secondary Search Report property is null by default, but you can edit this property to include a separate report for searching when the staff member selects Add &gt; Add Existing.  To modify a report used in a workspace: You must determine which report is used by the workspace. Then, you can copy that report and customize it. Then, update the workspace to use the customized report. Note: Not all relationship items can have their report modified. If you are using a default, standard Â workspace, you must copy the workspace, edit the copy, and then update appropriate staff profiles to use the edited (copied) workspace. Step 1: Determine which report is used by the workspace Open the workspace for editing or copy a default workspace and open the copy for editing. Click on the field or feature that uses the report that you want to edit. This may be a field that Â has Â a magnifying glass next to it. Â  This may also be a report used on a tab. Click the tab and then click the body of the tab to highlight the relationship item. Â  From the Design tab, click Â the Â Report button on the ribbon or Search Report botton on the ribbon to determine which report is used. The report Â specified Â includes a filter for the ID of the record type used in the workspace. Â   Step 2: Â Create a custom report to use in the workspace Click the Analytics navigation Â button and open the Reports Explorer. Â  From the Reports Explorer, click Find and search for the report used in the workspace. Â  Copy the report. Note where you save the report within Â the Public reports. Â  Open the copied report and edit the report to add or remove run-time filters Â or output columns.  Â  Important! Be sure to leave the filter that uses the ID field for the record type (such as Contact ID or Incident ID). The ID field is what allows the records to be filtered within the workspace.  Step 3: Update the workspace to use your Â custom report Â  Return to the workspace and click on the relationship item or field. Â  Click the property that you wish to edit. Â  Â  Â  In the pop-up window, select your new report from where you saved it and click OK. Â  Save the workspace. Â  If you created a new workspace from a default workspace, modify appropriate staff profiles to use your new workspace. Â  Â  Repeat these steps Â for other workspaces as necessary. Now that your workspace is configured to use a customized report, if you need to edit the report within the workspace, you can simply edit the report itself without having to edit the workspace again. Report properties: Â Additional properties Â can be set for reports used in a workspace. Â  Specific reports may have all the properties listed below while others may only have one or two properties, depending on the specific report and relationship item it is associated with. Hide Report Commands: Â  Hides or displays the report commands Â on the workspace. This includes the bar Â that has the Â New, Edit, Copy, Delete, Print, Forward, Assign, and Propose features associated with the Â record type.  Â  Show Row Count:  Â Displays the number of records in a report next to the tab title.  Â  Delay Report Execution: Â  Â Specifies whether the report runs Â when the workspace opens or if the report runs when the user clicks the tab associated with the report. Â By delaying the Â report execution, less data needs to load when the record is opened, which improves performance for records with large amounts of Â data associated to the various tabs of your workspace. Â   Â  If the report is on the top tab, it will always run as soon as the workspace Â  Â is opened, regardless of this property setting. Â   Â  Filter on Primary Key Only:  Â Restricts filtering to the primary key or allows filtering on related objects. For example, with True selected, an incident report uses only the incident ID Â  Â filter; when False, the report also uses contact ID and organization ID.  Â  Â  Â  Refresh Report When Data Changes: Â  Indicates whether the report runs again and refreshes Â when data is changed. Â  Â   Â  Execute for New Records: Â  Permits the report to run when you open the workspace to create a new record. By default, this option is disabled to prevent reports that rely on data from Â the record from attempting to run Â and timing out. We recommend that you enable this option only when the report you select does not query data from the record being created.  Â  Â  "

When the Customize Reports option is enabled, staff can right click on a column heading in a generated report and select from the following options:  Edit Format Edit Calculations Sort Ascending Sort Descending Hide Column Insert Hidden Column  In addition, when the staff member's profile has the Customize Reports option enabled, the staff member can click the column heading to sort the report records in ascending or descending order. Â   Note: By holding the Shift key down, staff can choose to sort multiple columns. Clicking more than once on a column heading will toggle the sort order between ascending and descending.  This option also gives staff the ability to Â access Analyze options on the Reports ribbon. Customizing report parameters: Â Staff who can customize their reports can also set specific default search parameters for the report. Â  That is, they can customize the search parameters so that the next time they access the report, the report runs based on the custom parameters instead of the default parameters configured in the report. To save custom search parameters, the staff member can click the Search button and then modify the run-time filters. Then, the staff member can click Save Defaults in the lower section of the pop-up window. Then, when the staff member opens the report the next time, the customized parameters are set as the default values. To enable the Customize Reports option, use the steps below:  From the Configuration Items, select Staff Management &gt; Profiles.

Resetting a locked staff account and password;Answer ID 2176;How do I unlock a staff account?;['Answer ID 2059', 'Answer ID 7537', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Staff Accounts Oracle B2C Service  Issue   A staff member has locked their staff account. When they try to log in, they get a message indicating that their account is locked.;"  When a staff account is locked, the Account Locked flag in the staff record is enabled. Therefore, to unlock the record, a staff member who has access to the Staff Accounts table must edit the staff record to clear the flag. Using the steps below, they can also reset a password as needed.  From the Configuration Items, select Staff Management &gt; Staff Accounts by Group. Double click Â a staff account to open it for editing. Click the Account Locked check box so that it is clear. Reset the account password to allow the staff member to log in. Click Save and Close from the ribbon. Verify that the staff member can login.  Once the staff member has successfully logged in, they can change their password. Â The staff member can select Preferences &gt; Change Password to update their password.  Usually, when an account has been locked, it is because a staff member has tried to log in with the incorrect password. After a specified number of attempts, the account will be locked by the system. By default, the user has five attempts to log in. After that, the account will be locked. Note: Passwords are not interface specific. You can change the number of login attempts through the Password Configuration menu. The path to edit this is: Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Password Configuration &gt; Number of Invalid Logins field. In addition, if your password configuration is set to have passwords expire after a certain amount of time, the staff account will be locked after the appropriate time and grace period have passed. Note: If the staff account has been permanently disabled, it can never be re-enabled. Instead, you must create a new staff account. To avoid confusion between the disabled account and the new one, you can edit the disabled account to remove the email address or to rename the account. Important: Per our security policy, Oracle B2C Service Technical Support engineers are not permitted to administer Staff Accounts for our customersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sites; in particular resetting Staff Account passwords and/or unlocking Staff Accounts. Â  Â In the event that you have locked yourself out of your Staff Account, please contact your site administrator(s) to have your account unlocked. Using the System-Defined Administrator account: If you are the Primary Support Contact for your organization, and you have locked yourself out of your own Staff Account, please login with the Â System-Defined Administrator account to access and administer your Staff Account. If you are the Primary Support Contact and you have no record of the system-defined Â Oracle B2C Service System-Defined Administrator account password, you can reset/retrieve this account Â from the tools in the Oracle Cloud Portal - Configuration Assistant.  Refer to the 'Resetting the system administrator password' section in the Â Service Cloud Configuration Assistant documentation.  If you are the Primary Support Contact and are unable to reset the password using Configuration Assistant, please submit a service request to Â Oracle B2C Service Technical Support and an agent will assist you with the System-Defined Administrator account password. Â  Â This request will need to be submitted by the Primary Support Contact for your organization, in writing and in a service request.

Redirect to URL task does not work;Answer ID 2177;Our campaign includes a redirect to a URL, but the user is not getting directed as we have configured.;['Answer ID 2059', 'Answer ID 7537', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Outreach/Feedback, Campaigns; The Redirect to URL action is used to redirect the contact to a specific Web page, such as a company home page. Within your campaign, you may have several actions triggered from a specific event. When contacts click Submit, all actions happen simultaneously. If your campaign includes more than one task / action that uses web content (either serving a Web page or redirecting the URL), only the first action is executed. This is because opening multiple browser windows on a single submit action is typically a poor user experience since multiple actions are happening. However, you could include a link on the first web page to allow contacts to proceed to the next page. Another option is to include JavaScript on the first page that automatically redirects to the URL of interest after 5 seconds or so. You could also evaluate your campaign to determine if one page can be eliminated from the campaign or if the content can be merged into a single page.

Using the Organization Hierarchy feature;Answer ID 2179;Can I create parent and sub-organizations using the Organization Hierarchy feature?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Organizations, Contacts Oracle B2C Service;"  The hierarchy functionality is controlled by the organization workspace. In order to edit the organization hierarchy, the staff member's Â profile must allow the ability to edit organization records and must also Â call out an organization workspace that includes the ability to edit the hierarchy relationship item. To add an existing organization as a child record:  Open Â the parent Â organization record and click the Hierarchy tab. Â    Click the Add button in the toolbar and select Add Â Existing. Â    In the pop-up window search for the child organization, select the child record and click Select. The child record will display on the Hierarchy tab. Â     Â Save the parent organization.  To add a new organization as a child record:  Open Â the parent Â organization record and click the Hierarchy tab. Â    Click the Add button in the toolbar and select Add Â New. Or right click on the parent folder and select Add &gt; Add New. Â    In the pop-up organization editor, enter the organization information for the child record and click OK. The child record will display on the Hierarchy tab. Â     Â Save the parent organization. Â  Important! Â  The new child organization record does not get created until the parent record is saved.  To remove a sub-organization from the parent organization:  Open Â the parent Â organization record and click the Hierarchy tab. Â  Â    In the frame, highlight the child record and click Remove from the tool bar. Or right click on the child record and select Remove. Â    Save the parent organization record.  An organization can have an unlimited number of subordinates, organized into a maximum of twelve levels per parent organization.  Contact and Incident Associations  Contacts can only be associated with one organization record -- either the parent record or one of the children organizations. When a contact submits an incident, the incident is associated with the organization for that contact. That is, if a contact for the child organization submits an incident, that incident is associated with the child organization, not the parent. You can enable contacts associated with parent organizations to be able to view incidents associated with sub-organizations. The MYQ_VIEW_ORG_INCIDENTS  Â configuration setting specifies which incidents can be viewed by the end-user who is logged in. Values range from 0 to 2, with 0 as the default. A value of 0 means the end-user can view only their own incidents. A value of 1 means the end-user can view their incidents and incidents from others in their organization. A value of 2 means the end-user can view their incidents, incidents from others in their organization, and incidents from all their organization's subsidiaries. Note: In order to view incidents from another organization, the contact record must be associated to an organization that is at a higher level in the organization tree.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.

Setting up escalation rules;Answer ID 2181;How do I set up escalation rules?;['Answer ID 1231', 'Answer ID 7815', 'Answer ID 2015', 'Answer ID 1842', 'Answer ID 2205', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Escalation, BusinessÃ‚Â Rules, All versions Oracle B2C Service;"  Business rules are configured from Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Rules. Â  Select the Edit mode from the ribbon and the type of rule you wish to create (i.e. incident, answer, etc.) to begin editing the rulebase. Setting escalations uses two distinct rules. The first rule, also called the ""chain"" rule, defines the conditions of the escalation and specifies the escalation level to be set in a specific timeframe. The second rule indicates the actions to be taken when the escalation occurs. The main steps to the escalation process are:  When a record is created or saved, it is compared to the rules and functions called within the rule state.   During the comparison to the rules, the record might match the chain rule for an escalation.   The chain rule includes an action in the THEN part of the rule ""Escalate to Level ..."" and defines an absolute or relative time for the record to escalate to the level indicated. At this point, the escalation is only a pending escalation.   After the time specified in the chain rule passes, when the dbstatus utility runs, the escalation level for the record is changed and the record is updated.   This update of changing the escalation level triggers the record to again be compared to the rules and functions in that rule state.   If your rules are set up correctly, the record will match the second of your rules and the actions associated with the escalation are executed.  For information on how to test your escalation rules, refer to Â Testing escalation rules. Escalations should be cleared before moving to a closed status. Refer to Clear rule escalations before moving to a closed state Â for more information. For example, using the rules below, you can escalate an incident if it is still unresolved 4 hours after it has been created and send a notification to a supervisor or manager. Rule: Esc 4 hours - chain IF Incident: Escalation Level = unspecified AND Incident: Status = Unresolved THEN Escalate to Level: 4 hr (or whatever name you choose) + 4 hours relative to Time Created. Ã¢Ë†Å¡ Use response interval Ã¢Ë†Å¡ Revalidate (Check the relative check box and the Use Response Interval and Revalidate check boxes.)  Rule: Esc 4 hours IF Incident.Escalation Level = 4 hr AND Incident.Previous Escalation not equals 4 hr THEN Send Escalation Notification (select staff member or group) Include whatever other actions you deem necessary Note that when setting up the second rule, the IF criteria included an item for both the current escalation level and the previous escalation level. The previous escalation level is only set when the escalation value changes. This helps to restrict the escalation actions to the specific incidents that have just changed the value of the escalation level when the incident was updated by dbstatus. When configuring your chain rule, you must determine whether you want to check the Use Response Interval and Revalidate check boxes. If you check the Use Response Interval box, only time that is included in your default response requirements are used in the time element. That is, if you specify 4 hours as the time element and check the box, this means, 4 work hours as configured in your Default Response Requirements table. If you check the Revalidate box, at the time of the escalation, the incident is compared again to the original IF conditions and the incident is escalated only if it still meets the IF conditions of the chain rule. For more information on these options, refer to Â Response Intervals and Revalidation. Once all edits are done, select Compile and/or Activate for the newly created rules to take affect. For more information regarding business rules, refer to the following published answers: Answer ID 1842: Overview of business rule functionality Answer ID 2205: Best practices for setting up incident rules  For additional information, refer to the 'Rules for Escalation of Answers, Incidents, Opportunities and Tasks' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Amount of content that can be copied into answers;Answer ID 2182;Is there a limitation to the amount of information (characters) I can copy into an answer?;['Answer ID 1914'];  Answer content; The Question and Answer fields in an answer record is a longblob field, which for practical purposes is unrestricted. Longblob fields allow up to 4 gigabytes of data. However, this only takes into account the type of database field which addresses the number of characters allowed in the field. This does not take into account the HTML editor (if enabled), the number of keywords indexed, Â or the process of saving and editing answers. Usually when you copy content -- especially from Microsoft applications -- there is considerable extraneous HTML code that is copied as well to format the content. For example, it is not uncommon for 6,000 characters of content to generate 40,000+ characters of code Â that get copied in to the content field of the Â answer -- due to all of the extra Â HTML code. Â  To avoid this, right click and choose Â copy as text. You can see how much extra code is being copied in by checking the source code for the answer. To do this, click the Source tab when editing Â the answer. Â   Â  Â  Â   Usability Considerations When adding content to answers, it is important to consider the usability Â for the end-user who will be Â viewing and reading Â the answer. If there is too much information contained within a single answer, it can actually be more difficult for Â end-users to use your site, because they end up having to sift through considerable content to get to the information that is most useful to them. Instead of copying the entire contents of a document or file into an answer, consider the options below with regard to your end-users and how they can access information. Option 1: If possible break the overall comprehensive content into smaller sections of content and publish several answers with each answer containing a major section of the overall content. Option 2: Instead of copying the contents of a file into an answer, place the file on a server along with the other pages of your Web site so that you can link to the file from the answer. That way, your users can open the data in another window if they wish. Another option is to attach the file to the answer. This allows you to keep the content of the answer relatively short and still allow access to the full document. Note: You can configure the answer type of a specific answer to be either URL or File Attachment so that when the Summary link is clicked from the Answer List page, the document or file opens directly from the Summary link.  Indexing Considerations When an answer is saved, the number of words and phrases that are indexed for that answer Â is limited to 750 words and phrases. As a result, long answers frequently do not have the entire content indexed so that end-users Â who perform a search may not see the answer returned in the search results. For more information on indexing, refer to Answer ID 1914: Indexing keywords and phrases for answers.

Incidents are escalated even though they no longer meet the criteria;Answer ID 2185;Why are incidents being escalated, even though they no longer meet the criteria for escalation?;['Answer ID 1914'];  Business Rules;" When setting up escalation rules, you must determine whether to enable the Revalidate checkbox. In general, when configuring escalation rules, you will enable the Revalidate box so that records are revalidated to still match the condition at the time of escalation. When escalating a record, there are two rules in effect: the ""chain"" rule that specifies the criteria for escalation and determines the time frame for setting the escalation level and another rule that includes the escalation actions that acts on the record that is set to the escalation level. Within the chain rule, in the THEN section, one of the actions to include is Escalate. When you add the Escalate action, several fields become available to be set, including the Revalidate check box. When the Revalidate check box is enabled: the escalation conditions are checked again at the time of escalation to determine if the record still meets the criteria to be escalated. If the record has been edited so that the escalation criteria are no longer met, the record will not be escalated, even though it initially met the original criteria. For example, if the escalation criteria indicates that an incident must be in an unresolved status and assigned to a specific group in order for it to be escalated, if you check the Revalidate box, the incident will have to be in an unresolved status and still assigned to the specific group at the time it is escalated in order for the escalation rule to take effect. If the incident is assigned to another group or is assigned to a solved or waiting status, it will no longer meet the escalation criteria and will not be escalated. If the revalidate check box were not enabled, then the incident would end up escalated, regardless of status and which group it was later assigned to."

Scheduling an email to be sent from a campaign;Answer ID 2187;In the campaign flow, do tasks after a scheduled task happen immediately or do they happen sequentially after the scheduled task has been completed?;['Answer ID 2177'];  Campaigns, Tasks;" When you configure multiple tasks within a campaign, ALL tasks are executed immediately -- even if there is a scheduled delay for one or more tasks that send emails to the contact. A campaign does not stop its flow when there is a timer scheduled for an Email to Contact task. All of the actions in a particular chain happen immediately. For Email to Contact tasks, the email is immediately scheduled to be sent at either an absolute date and time or is scheduled to a time relative to when the user pressed Submit on the web form. Note: If your tasks include multiple actions associated with web forms, either serving a web page or redirecting to a different URL, only the first action is executed to ensure a positive user experience.

State Child Protection Registry laws and email marketers;Answer ID 2190;How do the State Child Protection Registry laws effect email marketers?;['Answer ID 31', 'Answer ID 2412', 'Answer ID 4189'];  Outreach, Feedback;  Michigan/Utah Child Protection Registry On July 1, 2005, in Utah and November 16th, 2005, in Michigan, new state laws took effect that prohibit sending email to a minor whose email address is listed on registries maintained by the State. There is considerable debate about the constitutionality of these laws and about whether they are preempted by the CAN-SPAM act. However, until those legal questions are resolved, your company may risk criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits by failing to comply with the new laws. We recommend you consult your legal adviser to determine the impact these laws may have on your business. In both cases the laws prohibit sending messages that advertise products which are illegal for a minor to buy or possess or participate in, such as alcohol, tobacco, pornography, gambling, lotteries, illegal drugs, and firearms. A violation with just a single message can bring penalties of $1000 - $5000, up to $250,000 per day per message. Compliance with the law requires senders to scrub their list of addresses every 30 days against each State's registry. This is a fee based process at a cost of $.007 per address in Michigan and $.005 in Utah. If you are a large mail sender, this will add a significant cost to your mailing campaigns. Each State provides detailed information on compliance at the following links: Michigan: https://www.protectmichild.com/technical_compliance.html Because these laws apply to a very specific type of email advertiser, they may not apply to you. However we advise that all Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service customers familiarize themselves with the State laws. The DMA (Direct Marketing Association) has provided an excellent, detailed overview at http://www.the-dma.org/cgi/dispnewsstand?article=3888.

How can I have the report subscription sent only if there is actually data in the report.;" To set up an alert to be sent only when data exists in a report, use the steps below. For more information and specific steps on setting up data exceptions and Â alerts, refer to Answer ID 1854: Using Alerts with Report Subscriptions.  Step 1: Define your basic report. Â Set up the report to use as the basis for your scheduled report. Define the table instances, filters, and output for the report to be sent. For more information on configuring reports in RightNow, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating Custom Reports. Step 2: Define the data exceptions to be used. Â To send an alert only if any data is present, you want to set the data exception so that any data listed in the report will meet the data exception. For example, in the case of newly published answers, you could define the data exception to be ""Answer ID &gt; 0"". Since all Answer IDs are greater than 0, every answer in the report will meet the exception. Similarly, you could define the exception to be Status Type in list ""Public"". Again, since all published answers have a public status type, all records in the report will qualify as an exception. Note: In a general report, you can set data exceptions so that they display using a different format than other data in the report. However, when setting an exception for purposes of triggering an alert, you most likely do not want the exception to display in a unique format. Edit the data exception by Â going to the Insert tab and then clicking the Exception button. Click the Tabular Display tab, then Â Click the Use Custom Display Options to set the data marking to ""None"" and set the style to be your standard report style, such as 10 pt. Times New Roman and black. Â   Â  Step 3: Set up the alert. Â The alert itself is configured Â similar to a scheduled report. Â  However, the report is sent only if the alert conditions are met. While editing the report, open the scheduling window. From the Home tab, click the Scheduling button. From the scheduling window, click the Add Schedule link. Add an alert in the Alerts section of the page and specify who the alert report should be sent to. After defining the alert conditions, be sure to save the report itself."

Setting custom fields as required;Answer ID 2194;How are custom fields set as required or not?;['Answer ID 2518'];  Custom Fields, All versions Issue  WeÃ‚Â have several custom fields that are not configured to be required (from the Custom Fields table) but when our agents go to edit and save the records, some of the custom fields are required.; When configuring custom fields, the Required check box makes the field required on the end-user pages (if the field is enabled for end-user visibility). The Required check box also sets the default property for the custom field when it is added to a workspace. Â  Â  However, within a specific workspace, an administrator can set the Required property so that a custom field is Â not Â required when the record is added or edited from the RightNow Console. Â  This allows administrators to require fields for some staff members, but not require it for other staff. Â  Note: Administrators can set fields to be required based on their staff profile. Â  This allows administrators to require certain fields for specific profiles and not require fields for other profiles. Â  As a result, administrators do not need Â separate workspaces due to fields being required for some staff and not for other staff. When configuring the required property, there are four options available: Never - The field is never required to have a value. Â   Â  On New - The field requires a value for new records before the record can be saved. Â The field can be edited when working on existing records, but it is no longer required. Â   Â  On Open - The field can be Â set on new records, but is not required. The field requires a value when an existing record is edited. Â   Â  On New and Open - The field is always required. Â   Within a workspace, use the steps below to modify the Required property: Open the workspace for editing.  Â  Click the custom field in the workspace. If the field has not yet been added to the workspace, drag the custom field on to the workspace.  Â  From the Design ribbon, set Â the Required property for the field. Â  Â   Â  Save the workspace. Note: When a field is required, the label appears on the workspace in red text with a red bullet. Â  Â  For more information on editing workspace properties, refer to Answer ID 2518: Setting Properties in Workspaces. Required property in the custom field table: The custom field may have the Required check box enabled in the custom fields table. When that field is placed into a workspace, the default value for the Required property is automatically enabled to be required for all profiles and staff. Â  However, the administrator can change the property in the workspace to override the default and the field Â is not required for staff who use that workspace. Similarly, the custom field may not have the Required box checked in the custom fields table, but the administrator can change the property in the workspace so that the field is required for staff using that workspace.

Opening file attachments without executing the code in the file;Answer ID 2202;How do I open file attachments without executing code that may be included in those files?;['Answer ID 2518'];   File Attachments Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  When working with file attachments, users should be careful when opening files which may contain code that will be executed. Of particular concern are executable files (.exe) which, when opened, can perform any operation on your system. It is recommended that executable files be deleted from the incident. The following file types may pose a threat since a malicious user could embed javascript code inside the file that could be used to obtain information contained on the incident page from which the file was opened: html files (.htm) javascript files (.js) behavior files (.htc) cascading style sheets (.css) text files (.txt)  When opening files of these types, Internet Explorer will be used to open the file and will execute any javascript contained within the file. Instead of clicking on the file attachment link for these types of files, it is recommended that the user instead right-click the link and save the file. After the file has been saved it should be examined inside of a text editor such as Notepad.

Best practices for setting up incident rules;Answer ID 2205;What are the best practices when setting up incident rules?;['Answer ID 2181', 'Answer ID 453', 'Answer ID 486', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Business (Workflow/Escalation) Rules in your Oracle B2C Service application;"  Incident rulesets can become quite intricate and complex. However, the best practices listed below will help you set up a solid foundation for your ruleset that allows you to both organize your rules and take advantage of useful actions that can be accomplished using rules.  Â   General Rule Setup and Structure  Some best practices are focused on the overall setup of the rulebase and how it is structured:  Plot and draw out your workflow process on paper before building rules. This allows you to not only understand your routing and handling process, but also identifies inefficiencies in your current process. Â   Â  Have queues, staff accounts, custom fields and profiles in place and functioning before building rules. Incident rules are commonly used to route incidents or set fields. Make sure the necessary items exist in your application before you try to create your rules. Â   Â  Create at least two rule states. One rule state must be set as the Initial state. The initial rule state contains the rules for initial routing of new incidents created in the application. You should have at least one non-initial state that is used for acting on and handling updates to existing incidents. Â   Â  Transition all incidents from the initial state. Make sure the rules in your initial rule state include adequate actions to transition incidents to another state after the initial action or actions have been performed, such as assigning the incident to a specific person or to a queue. Â   Â  Each incident should only hit the rules in the initial state once and then be transitioned to another state. If an incident remains in the initial state, the next time it is updated, it will hit the same rules and get routed again as though it were a new incident. This causes a looping effect and agents may not be able to reassign incidents to another person or group. Â   Â  Include the most important and specific rules toward the top of the list. Frequently, an incident is able to match several rules that are set up. Order your rules so that the most restrictive and most important rules and actions are listed at the top of the rule list. This ensures that those rules act upon the incidents correctly.  Then, make sure the rule either transitions the incident to another state or make sure that follow on rules will not act on the incident unexpectedly and ""overwrite"" the initial action. For example, if incidents from a specific company are supposed to be routed to a certain agent, include that rule towards the top of the list and then make sure that incident will not be acted on and reassigned based on rules further down in the list. Â   Â  Include a catch-all rule. Create a catch-all incident rule at the bottom of the rules listed in the initial state so that no new incident goes unassigned and unresolved and gets lost in the system. Typically, this rule will read:  IF Incident.Status Type = Unresolved THEN Assign incident (to queue or staff member) AND Transition state to (existing state). Â   Â  Include a catch-all escalation action. As the rules are transitioned to a non-initial state, have your incidents match a general escalation-chain rule so that an escalation is triggered so that someone in your organization is notified if an unresolved incident is not updated for an extended period of time. This draws attention to older incidents that need to be handled and resolved. Â   Â  Determine whether functions should be used. You do not have to use functions within your rulebase. Functions are designed to group sets of rules that you need to apply several times throughout the life of the incident. That way, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to recreate the same set of rules many times in your rulebase. If you find that you do need to run the same set of rules several times (such as with escalation rules), place those rules in a function and then call that function from a specific rule. Â   Â  Use the Notes field to describe each rule. When adding or editing a rule, include a brief description of the rule in the Notes field. Include the date that it was added and by whom so that other administrators at a later time can better understand the purpose of the rule within the overall setup. When you hover over a rule in the left frame, the Notes field displays as a pop-up so that you can easily review the purpose of the rule.  Â   Set up and Order Escalation Actions   Include two rules for each escalation. When configuring escalations, two rules are used for each escalation action. You must use a Chain Rule (which sets the timeframe and conditions for escalating an incident) and an Action Rule (which specifies the actions to execute when the escalation occurs, such as sending an email to a manager). For more information on escalation rules, refer to Answer ID 2181: Setting up Escalation Rules. Â   Â  List Action rules before Chain rules. With the pair of escalation rules, place the Action rule above the Chain rule. If you have several pairs of escalation rules, list the group of Action rules first, followed by the group of Chain rules. That way, incidents that have already matched a chain rule from a previous update will match the Action rule and then have the opportunity to match a different escalation criteria. Â   Â  Create an Escalation function. Even if you have just a couple pairs of escalation rules, consider placing them in a function so that all escalation rules are grouped together. Then call the escalation function from a rule. This allows you to easily review your overall escalation process and verify the pairs of rules that are configured.  Â   Utilize Specific Actions  The Add Action menu in the THEN section of a rule includes several options that can reduce the number of incidents from being submitted or automatically provide information for specific types of incidents. Understanding these options can help you automate processes even more.  Suggest answers to users when they submit their incident. Use the SmartAssistant suggested solutions feature to automatically suggest answers from your knowledge base when an end-user submits a question. Before the incident is created, users will see a list of answers and then have the option to continue submitting their question. For more information as to how to configure this, refer to Answer ID 453: Automatically suggesting solutions for Ask a Question requests. Â   Â  Restrict SmartAssistant solutions by product or category value. The SA_SUGGEST_LIMIT_PROD_LVL and SA_SUGGEST_CAT_LVL configuration settings allow you to configure the application to restrict suggested solution by the product or category value of the incident being submitted. Setting the Product level to a value of 1 restricts the SmartAssistant solution to the same product value. If products are not used on the end-user pages, you can set the Category level to 1 to restrict solutions by the category value.  Note: In general, we do not recommend setting either of these values to a value greater than 1 unless you have a very large set of published answers (over 1000 answers, for example) AND if you have determined that your end-users are very good at selecting the sub-product or sub-category values when they submit an incident.  In addition, if you have both products and categories enabled, it is best to only restrict suggested solutions by the product unless your end-users are very good at selecting the correct product AND category when they submit their request. Frequently, end-users will do a good job selecting one value, but may not be as good at selecting the other field. Â   Â  Append an existing Answer ID to specific requests. Determine the types of incidents where specific answer IDs should be recommended to your users. Create a rule that uses the action Append Thread &gt; Append Existing Solution by Answer ID to Response Field to display the specific answer to these incoming incidents. This helps to resolve the issue BEFORE the incident is created. Â   Â  Append a specific response to requests. As appropriate, determine the type of incidents where a standard text response can be automatically displayed with the incoming request. Then, create a rule that includes the action Append Thread &gt; Append Response Template to Response Field. This allows you to display standard text responses to the end user to help resolve their issue BEFORE the incident is created.  In these cases, if the incident came in, the agent would be using the standard text anyway to send back to the end user immediately. Setting up an incident rule to automatically display the text response involves no human intervention, yet gives the end-user the same information they would have received from an agent. This cuts down agent work time, and handles redundant questions automatically. Â   Â  Use Matches Regular Expression as IF criteria. To identify specific types of redundant incidents, use the IF condition: Incident.Customer Thread matches regular expression. Then use the pipe ( | ) to specify words or phrases within the incoming incident that should trigger the rule. For more information on regular expressions, refer to Answer ID 486: Regular expressions and how they apply to rules Â or search on ""regular expression"" in the Oracle B2C Service knowledge base. In the THEN part of the rule, you can append a specific answer ID or a standard response.  And finally: Â  After you finish writing your rules, review them to make sure that you haven't left any loopholes. Try to make sure that every scenario is covered. Create a few test records and use the rule log to make sure that all the rules fired correctly.

Allowing customers to opt-out of certain types of mailings;Answer ID 2207;How can I allow customers to opt-out of certain types of mailings?;['Answer ID 2350', 'Answer ID 1954', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service, Audiences, Contact Opt-in/out options;"  Within Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service, you can add additional custom contact fields that can be used to specify which types of mailings the contact would like to be opted in to receive. For each of your different types of mailings, you can create additional opt-in fields that display on the Contact Â record and can be enabled for end-user editability on the My Â Account - Â Profile page. For example, you can create additional opt-in values for different types of mailings, including newsletters, product notifications, promotions, and customer service notifications. Then, you can create segments that use the appropriate opt-in field(s) as filters for your mailing audience. Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service includes a system-defined Global Opt-In field that can be used to filter contacts based on the value of the field. You can use this system field to supercede all other custom fields that are set up as an opt-in data type. That is, you can define audience segments to only send the mailing if the Global Opt-In field is set to Yes or is Unspecified. The Global Opt-In field is not automatically evaluated or included Â when defining a mailing list or segment. Though the global opt-in is not included automatically when defining a list or segment, when you create a mailing, the Audience tab defaults to honor the global opt-in so that the mailing is sent only to contacts whose global opt-in field is set to Yes or if the field is null. Â  With this default audience, only contacts whose records have the global opt-in set to No are excluded from receiving the mailing. For more information on excluding mailings from contacts who are opted out, refer to Answer ID 2350: Preventing mailings from being sent to opted-out contacts. For more information on creating segments, refer to Answer 1954: Creating a contact list or a segment for a mailing or survey. To add a custom opt-in field: Use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select Database &gt; Â Custom Fields &gt; Contacts. Click the New button on the ribbon Â to add a Â Custom Field. Set the Data Type to be Opt-in. Enter the Common and Language names along with a default value if you wish. Enable the visibility for the appropriate consoles. To allow end-users the ability to edit the field from the My Â Account - Â Profiles page, enable the End-user: Read/Write Â checkboxes in the Visibility section. Click Save. Open new consoles to verify that the field displays and can be edited from the appropriate areas of the product. Log in to your end-user pages to verify that the end-user can edit (or not access) the field as you wish to have it configured.  For more information regarding opt-in options, refer to the 'Managing contact opt-ins' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

How an incident's due date is calculated;Answer ID 2215;What is an incident's relative due date (incidents.rel_due) and how is it calculated?;['Answer ID 4729', 'Answer ID 4729', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Service Level Agreements, Response Time;  When an incident is created, an initial due date is calculated. This value Â only changes when the response requirements associated with the incident are changed due to the application of a service level agreement (SLA) or if the Â RECALC_INCIDENT_DUE configuration is set. Â  The relative due date is calculated by taking the incident's time of creation and adding the response time (from response requirements) associated with the incident. In addition, the due date takes into account the work hours that are configured in the Default Response Requirements table or the hours configured in the applied SLA. For example if RECALC_INCIDENT_DUE is set to 0, the incident's response time is 45 minutes and the incident comes into the system at 9:00am on 10/10/07, the due date will be 10/10/07 at 9:45. This value does not change regardless of customer updates to the incident and/or additional responses. The value only changes if the response requirements change. Similarly, if the work interval is configured to be 8:00 to 17:00 on Monday through Friday, and the response requirement is 540 minutes (9 hours). If an incident comes in at 3:00pm on Friday, the date due will be 3:00pm on Monday because the work intervals are taken into account when calculating the date due. When incidents are created outside of business hours, the time the incident remained in the queue until the business hours begin is not counted against the due date. For example: Business hours are M-F 8:00 to 17:00. The response time is three hours. Â  An incident submitted on Saturday at 15:00 would be due Monday, 11:00 am. Note that the Resolution Time that is configured for the response requirements or an SLA Â is never used in calculating the date due value. Both the Response Time and the Resolution Time are based Â on the created time stamp of when the incident is initially created in the system. For examples of when the RECALC_INCIDENT_DUE is enabled, see Â Answer ID 4729: Description of RECALC_INCIDENT_DUE configuration setting For additional information, refer to the 'Configuring resolution due calculations' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

In order for the specific notification to be sent, it must be enabled for the interface. To determine if a notification is enabled, use the path: Configuration &gt; Â Site Configuration &gt; Message Templates &gt; select an interface &gt; Administrator Notifications &gt; Outreach. Â  The Mailing Â Started and Finished notifications are sent to staff members whose profile has the Launch / Suspend option enabled on the Outreach Â tab in the profile. These messages are sent to indicate when an Outbound Email is started and set to Sending status and when the mailing is finished and the status of the mailing is set to Completed. The Outreach Â Error notification is sent to staff members whose profile has the System Error Log option enabled on the Administration tab. This notification is sent when the application detects an error in an outbound email. The Campaign notification is sent to staff members who are listed in the Recipients section when a notification action is included in a campaign. That is, if the campaign includes the action to notify staff, the Campaign notification is sent to the staff listed in the Recipients section. If the staff account has the Notify Always checkbox enabled in their preferences, they will receive the notification via email as well as at the Communication Center &gt; Notifications page."

Displaying the week dates in a report;Answer ID 2217;How can I display the dates for the week instead of just a number?;['Answer ID 4729', 'Answer ID 4729', 'Answer ID 5168'];"  Analytics, Date Grouping Oracle B2C Service, All versions Issue  When I run a report and use ""week"" as the date grouping, the report lists a numerical value for the week (1, 2, 3, 4...)Ã‚Â instead of the date interval for that week."; This is as expected because the 'week' grouping counts the weeks in a year. Â  That is the numerical value you are seeing. Â  However, when generating reports, you may want to Â select Week Start for the Date Grouping field instead. When Week Start is selected, the date of the Â Sunday in the interval is listed in the report. Â  Within the Oracle B2C Service application, weeks are from Sunday through the following Saturday, so the week start is considered to be the Sunday involved with the interval. For example, if you generate the Answers Viewed report and select Week Start for the date grouping, the data is grouped by week and the Sundays are listed in the report as an indicator of which week the data is reporting. To help illustrate the difference, look at the Date column in the screen shots below:

Staff are not getting email notifications when logged out;Answer ID 2219;Why aren't the staff members getting an email notification when a record is assigned to them?;['Answer ID 4729', 'Answer ID 4729', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Administration Emails / Notifications;" Email messages are sent to staff members when the staff member is not Â logged in AND Â a notification is sent to them Â in the Communication Center. You can enable the Notify Always check box from either the staff account or from the personal settings when the staff member is logged in. When the Notify Always box is checked, the staff member will receive an email for each notification that is sent to the staff member, even if the staff member is logged in. Staff Account Configuration: If staff members do not receive an email for a notification, verify that the staff account has the proper email address configured for the account, the account is enabled, and there are Email Notifications selected. Â To check the staff account, use the steps below: From the Configuration items, select Staff Management &gt; Staff Accounts by Group. If the account is not listed, right click and select Show Disabled. Right click on the account name to open. Verify the email address. Verify the account is enabled. Verify the something is selected under the Email Notification Â dropdown field. Note: The staff member can edit this box through personal settings.  If Notify Always Â is NOT Enabled: The email notification is not sent to the agent when they are logged in to the system. For example, if they are logged in and the Incident Assigned message is enabled in your Messages table, the agent will receive the Incident Assigned notification in the administration console, but they will not receive the email. In addition, when Notify Always is not enabled, the email notification is sent only when the user is logged out of the RightNow application Â AND it is sent only the first time that a Â notification is sent. That is, if 3 incidents are assigned over the span of an hour and the agent is not logged in, the agent will receive only one email when the first incident is assigned. This email serves as an indicator that there is at least one Â notification at their Communication Center. Then, when they log in, they can see how many messages are there. Also, when Notify Always is not enabled, if the staff member does not log out of the application to end the session, RightNow is not aware that you should receive the email notification. If you run into certain types of errors, it is possible for you to get taken out of the system without actually logging out. Other situations where the users may not get logged out entirely is if they are using dial-up connections, if your site is using SSL, or proxy servers. Service Mailbox Configuration: If you are using the Oracle B2C Service or Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service modules, you must have a default Service mailbox configured in order for the emails to be sent. Even if your site only uses the Sales module and does not use Service, you must have a default Service mailbox enabled in order for the emails to be sent. If you do not have Service enabled in your site, you can access the Service Mailboxes table and set up a default mailbox using the steps below: First, open the Messages table using the path: Â Configuration &gt; Site Configuration Â &gt; Mailboxes. Â   Â  Click on the New button and select Service Mailbox. Â   Â  Add a name for the mailbox and check the Default box and Outgoing Email Enable box. Â   Â  Complete the information on the Outgoing Email tab. For the reply-to address, use an email address for an administrator who can receive emails if someone happens to reply to the email notification. Â   Â  Save the mailbox. Note: The mailbox as configured above will not receive incoming email. It is only configured to allow email to be sent from the RightNow application."

Getting started with Web Indexer;Answer ID 2221;How do we get web indexing set up for our site?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 5455'];   Web indexing;"  Web indexing allows additional web pages and documents that are not part of your published answers of your Oracle B2C Service application to be included in searches from your Oracle B2C Service end-user pages. The Web Indexer feature is sold separately from your Oracle B2C Service application. For more information on pricing and options, please contact your sales account manager.  Configuring the web indexer on your site utilizes a configuration wizard. To implement web indexer for your site, use the steps below:  Review configuration process. Before trying to configure the Web Indexer, review the comprehensive instructions Â in the documentation. Refer to the 'Indexing web pages' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Â To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Â    Determine URL normalization. Once the basic concepts of Web Indexing are understood, the area most often problematic for users is URL normalization. URL normalization Â allows you to remove items such as php parameters from URL's so that multiple copies of a given URL are not indexed. The difficulty arises with the regular expressions or SED statements that are required to define the portions of the URL to change. The example given in the interface can be supplemented by the explanation found here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Traditional_Unix_regular_expressions Â  Â    Configure Web Indexer for your site. Follow the instructions within the documentation and use a very specific site and small hop count to limit how far the web indexer searches. Â    Log into Oracle B2C Service console.  Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane.  Under Service --&gt; Knowledge Base --&gt; Double-click External Search Configuration. Â  The Configuration Wizard opens on the content pane.  Use the prompts in the Configuration Wizard to configure the Web Indexer. Click the Next button on the ribbon when you have finished configuring each page.  Click Save when you are finished.      Run keywordindexer utility -ew command: After the configuration wizard completes successfully, the keywordindexer utility must be run using the -ew command. To have this done, customers must submit an Ask Technical Support to run keywordindexer -ew Â and schedule regular times for keywordindexer -w Â to run in the future. Â    Evaluate your initial configuration: Â  After the utility runs, test your configuration for expected performance. You can then make changes to your configuration by re-running the configuration wizard and making small changes each time and checking the results in the external search log.

Suggesting spelling corrections and common word usage for end-user searches;Answer ID 2234;CanÃ‚Â Oracle RightNow Cloud ServiceÃ‚Â correct misspelled words when doing a search on the end-user pages?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Search term feedback, Spell Check dictionary Oracle B2C Service;"  Oracle RightNow Cloud Service Â can be configured to Â recommend a corrected spelling Â for an end-user who incorrectly Â enters a keyword while searching on the Â answer pages. Â  Â In addition, when this feature is enabled, if the end user searches on a common word that is excluded from searching, they receive a message:  ""These words are very common and not included:""  Spelling evaluation: Â  When this spell correction feature is enabled, the actions below are executed.  The search initially looks through the 'dictionary' table to find the word the end-user typed. If the word can be found, then no suggestion will be given.  Â  If the word is incorrectly Â spelled or not located in the dictionary, the system Â evaluates the dictionary files, Â including the userdic.tlx Â located in Â File Manager &gt; dictionary files. Â   Â  The incorrectly spelled word is stemmed (stripped back to the base word) and alternative keywords are looked up in these files from the stemmed word. Â  Â   Â  Finally, a new search is done using the new words found from the files above Â and a new search word is given through the Did you meanÃ¢â‚¬Â¦? function. Â  Â   For example, if a user searches on the misspelled Â word ""suppolt"" instead of ""support"" Â , the search results for ""suppolt"" will display, but above that, the user will see the phrase: ""Did you mean: support"" The user can click on ""support"" and a new search is performed.  Another example, if a user searches on the misspelled word 'adress' instead of 'address' and there is not a 'Did you mean: address' suggestion, then it is likely that the Â wrong spelling of the Â word is used in an answer. The 'dictionary' Â table records this as a valid word.  In addition to spelling corrections, users are also told which common words are excluded from searching, namely words that are listed in the exclude_answers.txt file.    To enable the Â spell correction and common word Â feature: Â  You must enable the Â  EU_SEARCH_TERM_FEEDBACK_ENABLE configuration setting. This setting enables or disables Â the display of spelling corrections and word usage feedback on the end-user search page. By default, this setting is enabled.  Â The standard widget Â reports/ResultInfo must be included on the page and Â in the same &lt;div&gt; as the other search controls for best formatting. When enabled, if someone searches the end-user pages and searches on a mistyped or misspelled word, a search suggestion that includes a corrected spelling is listed above the search results. The suggestion is a link so that the user can click the suggestion to view the search results for the corrected spelling. Note: Â  Â This configuration setting is active for all end-user page sets.

Using relative time filters in reports;Answer ID 2235;How do I use relative time values for reports?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, All versions Oracle B2C Service;"  When working with reports, you can include filters for date and time fields as selection criteria. For example, with incidents, you can include a filter based on when the incident was created or when the incident was solved. When you add a date and time field as a filter in a report, you will often select Between as the operator so that you can specify a range of dates to include in your report. Note that if you select ""="" you will be selecting a specific date AND a time down to the second, not just a specific date. As a result, it is unlikely that you will use the ""="" operator with date and time fields. When configuring date ranges, you can use either an absolute date or a relative date. If you run a report that uses an absolute date applied to it, the report will always show data for that particular date range, regardless of when you generate the report. If you use relative dates (by enabling the Relative check box), then the dates included in the report are determined relative to the date and time that you generate the report. Note: When working with relative dates, the 0 option refers to the current time unit, such as the current hour, day, week, or month.  Rounding: In addition, when working with relative dates, you can round to the beginning of the time unit to indicate that the relative time is at the beginning of the hour, day, week, or month. Rounding is useful when you need to include records for a complete day or week, such as all of yesterday's incidents or last week's published answers. The following Â image illustrates setting a relative and rounded date range for answers created in the previous month:   Click to enlarge image    Common Examples of Date Ranges   The examples below use intervals where the Relative box is enabled for each date element. For the elements listed, (rounded) means to select the option with the arrow and (NOT rounded) means select the option without the arrow. All records from Today: Set the date range to be: FROM 0 Days (rounded) TO 0 Days (NOT rounded). That is, enable the relative check boxes and select 0 Days (with the up arrow) to 0 Days (without arrow). Records for the Last 7 Days: Set the date range to be: FROM - 1 Week (NOT rounded) TO 0 Days (NOT rounded). This will return all records with the date value being up to 7 days before the date that the report is generated. For example, if today is Tuesday the 15th, at 10 a.m., this range would return incidents updated starting from 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday the 8th, up to the current day and time. Records for the current WEEK: Set the date range to be: FROM - 0 Week (rounded) TO 0 Days (NOT rounded). This will return all records with the date value being in the current week. For example, if today is the Tuesday, this range will return records starting from 12:01 a.m. on the previous Sunday, up to the current day and time. Records for the previous WEEK Set the date range to be: FROM - 1 Week (rounded) TO 0 Week (rounded). This will return all records with the date value being between Sunday through Saturday of the previous week. For example, if today is Tuesday, the 15th, this will return records starting from 12:01 a.m. on Sunday the 6th, up to midnight on Saturday the 12th. Records for the previous and current WEEKS Set the date range to be: FROM - 1 Week (rounded) TO 0 Week (NOT rounded): Returns all records with the date value being in the previous and current weeks. For example, if today is Tuesday the 15th, this would return incidents updated starting from 12:01 AM on Sunday the 6th, up to the current day and time. These examples can help you set the correct ranges for the current or previous hours, day, months, and quarters as well since the only difference would be the time unit you select.

Allowing Oracle B2C Service to index our entire web site for information;Answer ID 2237;What are the benefits of using Web Indexer?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Web Indexer Oracle B2C Service (OSvC);  The Â Oracle B2C Service Web Indexer enables indexing and searching of documents that are not part of your published public answers of your Â Oracle B2C Service application. For example, the Web Indexer allows additional Web pages, PDFs, and Microsoft Word documents to be indexed and searchable from your Oracle B2C Service end-user pages. Note: The Web Indexer feature is sold separately from your Oracle B2C Service applications. For more information on pricing and options, please contact your sales account manager. The Web Indexer makes it possible for end-users and agents to search for and access the additional documents and Web pages when searching from the Find Answers page. Indexing and searching of external documents are possible if the documents are stored on a Web server and are accessible via a URL. This will usually be limited to those files within the document root, CGI root, or FTP root directories. From the end-user pages, users can click the Documents button to search published answers and/or the additional pages that have been indexed. Initially, when users access the Documents page, the list of published answers displays. When the search is performed, additional links may display if the indexed pages match the search word or phrase. After you configure a root URL to be indexed and searchable, a Web spider is used to follow the hyperlinks contained within the Web page, indexing each consecutive page. If any of the consecutive Web pages contain hyperlinks, those hyperlinks are followed and those Web hyperlinks that are within specified domains, but are not among the excluded domains, subdomains, or URLs. Specified and excluded domains are configurable through the Management and Configuration Console. It is possible to have multiple URLs directed to the same document through URL masking and redirection, or the use of query parameters in a URL. During indexing, URLs are normalized to prevent a document from being indexed more than once. This normalization allows the spider to index the document a single time, which saves drive space on the server, increases search performance, and prevents end-users from getting the same document returned twice during a search. Note: External documents are not re-indexed if edited. You must run the keywordindexer utility after editing an external document if that document is to be re-indexed. You should schedule keywordindexer to re-index external documents nightly, weekly, or monthly, depending on how many changes are made to external documents on a particular site. The keyword indexes for external documents will be stored in a file on the Web server rather than in a database table.

Interval types in the Incident Performance table;Answer ID 2240;When using the Incident Performance table in a report, what are the different interval types that can be selected?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Incident Performance, inc_performance ;"  Note: The intervals are computed by the agedatabase utility. As a result, today's activity will not be available until tomorrow when the utility has compiled it. Also, intervals are not usually created until they are complete.        Type 1 - Create to Initial Response:    Interval Start: the creation of an incident  Interval End: when the first response for the incident is sent    Each incident can only have one Type 1 interval. Â            Type 2 - Status Change to Response:    Interval Start: when an incident that is set to a Waiting/Solved status type is changed to an Unresolved status type  Interval End: when a response is sent    An incident may not have any type 2 intervals associated with it.  Â For example, if an incident is never re-opened (set from Waiting/Solved to Unresolved status type) and responded to, then Â it will not have a type 2 interval.    It is also possible that an incident has multiple type 2 intervals. For example, Â if an incident is both re-opened (set from Waiting/Solved to Unresolved status type) and responded to multiple times, it will have multiple Â type 2 intervals.           Type 3 - Assign to Response:    Interval Start: when an incident is assigned to an agent  Interval End: when a response is sent    You may have several type=3 intervals per incident if an incident is ""worked"" by several staff members. The inc_performance.action_cnt field contains the number of responses that agents sent for the incident. The inc_performance.solved column is set to 1 if the staff member was responsible for solving the incident. If two staff members worked on the incident, there will be 2 intervals - only the agent who was the owner of the incident when it was solved will be credited for the solve. Â            Type 4 - Create to Final Resolve:    Interval Start: when an incident is created  Interval End: when the incident is set to a Solved status type    If the incident is re-opened, the interval will be removed and added again when it is solved again, using the final time as the end time. There will never be more than one type=4 interval per incident. The action_cnt field counts the total number of responses sent for that incident. The inc_performance.solved field will be set to 1. Â            Type 5 - Last Assigned to Final Resolve:    Interval Start: the time it was assigned to the last person it was assigned to before it was set to Solved  Interval End: when the incident is solved    There will never be more than one type=5 interval per incident. Â            Type 6 - Create to Initial Assigned:    Interval Start: when the incident is created  Interval End: when the incident is first assigned to an agent or staff group    There will never be more than one type=6 interval per incident. The action_cnt field will contain the total number of responses sent for the incident, including responses sent by agents other than the one it was initially assigned to. Â            Type 7 - Create to Initial Resolve:    Interval Start: when the incident is created  Interval End: the first time it is set to a solved status type    This interval will often be the same as the type=4 interval if the incident is not re-opened after it is solved. There will never be more than one type=7 interval. Â            Type 8 - Assigned to Re-assigned:    Interval Start: when the incident is assigned to an agent  Interval End: when the incident is re-assigned to another agent before a response is sent Â            Type 9 - Status Change to Re-assigned:    Interval Start: when the incident is changed from a Waiting or Solved status type to an Unresolved status type  Interval End: when the incident is re-assigned to another agent before a response is sent Â            Type 10 - Queued to De-queued:    Interval Start: when the incident is assigned to a queue  Interval End: when the incident is re-assigned to another queue or when the incident is set to a Solved type (even if the incident remains assigned to the initial queue) Â            Type 11 - Queued to Initial Assigned:    Interval Start: when the incident is assigned to a queue  Interval End: when the incident is assigned to a staff member Â            Type 12 - Queued to Initial Response:    Interval Start: when the incident is assigned to a queue  Interval End: the first time a response is sent for the incident Â            Type 13 - Queued to Initial Resolved:    Interval Start: when the incident is assigned to a queue  Interval End: the first time the incident is set to a solved status type Â            Type 14 - Backlog:    Interval Start: when the incident is created or when the status is changed from a Solved or Waiting status to an Unresolved status  Interval End: when the incident is edited and saved Â            Type 15 - Incident Edit:    Interval Start: when the incident is opened for editing  Interval End: when the agent clicks Save    This interval will often be the same as the type=4 interval if the incident is not re-opened after it is solved. Â              Type 16 - Servicing (queue defined interval only):    Interval Start: when the incident is created or when an incident that is set to a Solved or Waiting status type is changed to an Unresolved status type or a queue change  Interval End: when the incident is set to a Solved or Waiting status type Â or the incident is assigned to another queue.             Type 17 - Initial Response to Initial Resolve:    Interval Start: when the first response is sent  Interval End: when the incident status is changes to Solved status type for the first time Â            Type 18 - Queue Initial Response to Â Initial Resolve:    Interval Start: when the first response is sent for that queue  Interval End: when the incident status is changed to a Solved status type for the first time in the specified queue Â            Type 19 - Â Final to Waiting - Final Resolve:    Interval Start: the last time an incident status is changed to a Waiting status type  Interval End: the last time an incident status is changed to a Solved status type     The interval length (the time element reported for each interval) can be reported in two ways:  Absolute time: Absolute time is simply the difference between the two date and time values. For example, date_diff(inc_performance.time_end, inc_performance.time_start). This provides the total amount of time between the two times (in seconds) for the interval. Â    Work Hour Relative Interval: The relative time of the interval (related to work hours and holidays defined in the Response Requirements.) Relative time takes into account the default response requirements or the service level agreement that is applied to the incident. Relative time uses inc_performance.rel_time and calculates the time of the interval (in seconds) by including only the time that occurred during defined business hours. For further information, refer to the documentation on Defining default Response Requirements.  Therefore, if an incident is created at 3:00 AM and responded to at 8:02 AM, if your business hours start at 8:00 AM, the relative time for the Created to Initial Response (type=1 interval) is 120 (namely, 2 minutes), while the absolute time would be 18120 (or 5 hours and 2 minutes).

Adding or editing a chart in a report;Answer ID 2241;How do I add or edit a chart in a report?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Charts Oracle B2C Service;"  You can include charts with custom reports, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and area charts. For most chart types, you must specify a category and series. The category is the segmentation (or grouping) of the data. For example, if you were reporting the # of responses sent by different staff members, the 'staff members' would be your category. In a line chart, the category represents the values on the x-axis. The series represents the numerical values that are plotted, such as the height of a bar or the size of a slice in a pie chart. In a line chart, the series is the value plotted on the y-axis. In a graph, you can think of the series as the actual bars that extend across the screen, or the pieces of the pie, representing the actual count or measured value for each category. For example, if you were reporting the # of responses sent by different staff members, '# of responses' would be your series. In a horizontal bar chart, the category is used define the y-axis segmentation, whereas the series defines the measurements on the x-axis. Similarly, in a vertical bar chart, the category defines the groups along the x-axis and the series represents the values on the y-axis that will display the height of the vertical bars.  New report: Â When adding a new report, you can select between a grid report, standard report and standard report with chart. Â Select Standard Report with Chart.

This non deliverable return email will be received on the email address governed by the RPT_FROM_ADDR or IFWD_UI_FROM_ADDR. If the email gets sent from the default mailbox, the non deliverable return email will be sent to the default mailbox and if the email is sent from the email address of the account, the non deliverable return email will be sent to the account's email address. The non deliverable return email would like similar to the examples provided above.  Similarly, when forwarding an incident from the administration pages or emailing an answer from the end-user pages, you may receive a similar message indicating that the message ""did not reach some or all of the intended recipients"". You may get this message if the email address is invalid or if spoofed email is being filtered from delivery.  Â  Invalid Email Addresses  If the scheduled report, forwarded incident or emailed answer is sent to an email address that is no longer valid, you will receive this message. Check the email address(es) in the message to verify that the address still exists and is correct. You may need to modify the email address of a staff account if you are sending a report or forwarding an incident to the staff account (as opposed to entering the email address). If the email address is in a scheduled report and is incorrect or no longer valid, edit the subscription to remove or edit the email address from the list of recipients in the Send To box.  Â   Filters on Spoofed Email  If the email address(es) listed in the message is valid and correct, then this message was most likely Â blocked as a result of SPAM software that has determined that the From address of the email has a different domain that the actual domain from where the email was actually sent (which is called spoofing). That is, the software recognizes that the email was not actually sent from your specific email address. You can configure your application to spoof the email address when sending scheduled reports and when forwarding incidents. For scheduled reports, the RPT_FROM_ADDR configuration setting specifies the email address used when a report is emailed as a subscription or when using the Send To feature. If this setting is set to 1, the From address is the default mailbox for the interface. A value of 2 indicates that the email address of the staff member who owns the scheduled report or sends the report is used. As a result, if the RPT_FROM_ADDR setting is set to use the staff member's email address as the From address, SPAM software might reject the scheduled report email if the email domains of the staff member does not match. In this case, changing the RPT_FROM_ADDR setting to use the default mailbox address should resolve this issue and allow the report email to be delivered successfully. Â   Similarly, the IFWD_UI_FROM_ADDR  Â setting specifies the From address when forwarding an incident from the administration pages. If this setting is set to 3, which uses the staff member's email address, SPAM software might detect that the email domain for the staff member does not match the true email domain from which the email is sent. As a result, the email might get blocked. Again, changing the value of the configuration setting to another value will allow the email to be sent. Â Please note, if your mailbox is enabled for incoming messages any responses from the forward recipient sent to a mailbox address will create an incident.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings."

Cannot clear default pagination in a report;Answer ID 2250;How can I clear the pagination when my report is first run?;['Answer ID 1960'];  Analytics Issue  Some of our reportsÃ‚Â default to include pages when the report is run where each page has a maximum of 100 rows. We would like to clear that pagination.;" When I try to edit the report to remove the pagination, it does not keep my changes and reverts to the 100 record default. Reports can be configured to include a maximum record count. Â  This allows you to control the amount of data returned with the report query. Â  For example, if you have a report that Â includes various incident threads, you can set a record count so that the report will generate in an acceptable amount of time. There is a difference between the record count for a report and the number of records displayed per page configured from the Display &gt; Paging option. The record count indicates how many records are returned when the query is run. Â   Â  The records displayed per page indicates how many records to display on a single page within the report. The number of records displayed on a page cannot exceed the record count. Â  That is, the number of records displayed cannot exceed the number of records returned in the query. As a result, if a report has a record count configured, paging is automatically enabled. Â  If the number of records that meet the report criteria exceed the record count, only the first X records are returned in the report (on page 1) and additional pages are indicated for the additional records. Â  When the user clicks the next page, the query is run against the database to return the next X records. For example: You have 1700 public answers in your site. You have a report that lists the answer ID, summary, status and owner. The report has a record count of 500 records. When you run your report, the first 500 records display and there are 4 page numbers across the top of the report. Â  When the staff member clicks 2, the query Â is rerun and the Â 501-1000th records are displayed. Similarly, when the staff member clicks 3, the query is run again and the Â 1001-1500th records are displayed. Setting the record count in a report: If your report is automatically including paging when it is run, check to see if a record count is set for the report: Open the report for editing and select the level of the report that has the paging issue. From the Level tab, click the Record Limit button. Modify the record limit if necessary. Save the report.   "

Using the incidents.search_thread column in reports;Answer ID 2252;What is incidents.search_thread and when should or shouldn't I use it?;['Answer ID 2068', 'Answer ID 2213'];  Answers, Phrase searching;" When configuring incident reports, the Â incidents.search_thread filter adds the Summary/Thread option to the search options when performing an incident Â search. The Summary/Thread option allows Â staff to search both the Subject field and the incident discussion thread. The Summary/Thread option is not actually a field within the database and can only be used as a search filter. You cannot add the Summary/Thread to an output column for a view or report. From the incidents table, you can use the incident Subject field as an output column as an indicator for the incident listed in the report or view. You can also include thread components in your report by adding fields from the Threads table when joined to Â the Incidents table. Â  The incident thread includes the submittal and updates from your end-user, responses from the support agent, and internal notes added to the incident. For more information on Â reporting on threads, refer to Â  Answer ID 2068: Including an Incident Thread in a Report. Indexing search threads: Â  You can indicate which types of entries in the incident thread are indexed for searching. The INC_TYPE_IDX configuration setting allows you to specify which types of incident threads are indexed. By removing some types of threads from indexing, such as auto-responses or notes automatically appended by rules, you can improve the search performance on your site. Â  Removing these elements from indexing Â reduces both Â the amount of words and phrases added to the phrases table and also prevents Â standard content that is potentially added to several incidents from being indexed. For more information on indexing thread types, refer to Answer ID 2213: Thread Types Included in Searches. Including Summary Thread as a filter: Â  To add the Summary Thread option as a filter in a report or view, use the steps below: Open the report for editing.  Â  From the Home tab, click Add Filter from the Data Set section. Â   Â  In the Expression field, right click and select Incidents &gt; Summary Thread. Â  The term incidents.search_thread will display in the Expression field.  Â  Set the Operator value to Complex Expression.  Â  Click OK.  Â  Customize the rest of your report and save the report. Searching the Summary/Thread uses the words stored as phrases for that incident. This search option ignores case sensitivity, plurals, verb tenses and other word endings. For example, searching on ""WALK"" returns incidents containing any of the words ""walk"", ""walked"", "" Walking"", ""walker"", and ""Walks"".  "

Replacing or renaming an Oracle Managed Mailbox;Answer ID 2254;How can we rename the address for our Oracle B2C Service mailbox?;['Answer ID 7537', 'Answer ID 6354', 'Answer ID 6354'];   Mailboxes, Service and OutreachÃ‚Â  Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  With regard to incoming email, it is not possible to merely rename a mailbox. Instead, a new mailbox Â must be created to replace your existing mailbox. To replace an existing mail address, you should allow both mailboxes to exist and function for a period of time so that you can phase out the use of your old mailbox. That way, customers who reply to existing or older incidents can still reply to the emails that they have received from the existing box. After a period of time, Â such as Â a month or so, you can disable the older mailbox so that all email is handled through your new box. The steps below provide an outline of the actions to take to replace an existing mailbox.  Create a new mailbox Â using the new name and email address. This can be done using the Â Click Here option in the Oracle Cloud Portal.  See Â Click Here for steps to do this. Â  If you have questions regarding this service, please contact your account manager.   Configure a new mailbox in Oracle B2C Service for the new mailbox. The path to configure mailboxes is: Service Administration / Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes.   If the mailbox you are replacing was the default mailbox, set the new mailbox as your default mailbox. Â Open the mailbox for editing and check the 'Default' checkbox Â and save changes.   Optional: You can edit your existing mailbox in Oracle B2C Service so that the Email Address and Reply-To-Address on the Outgoing Email tab uses the email address for your new mailbox. That way, if someone clicks Reply from a response, the response will be sent to the new mailbox. However, this may confuse some recipients.   Check your business rules and update any rules that route incidents based on the mailbox to include both the existing and new mailboxes. This allows incidents to be handled the same regardless of which box the email is sent to.   Optional: Consider adding a standard response that you can use in a rule for incidents submitted to the old email address. The standard response can explain that this email address is being phased out and that future email should be directed to the new email address.   Review your company's website and other published information and edit sections that instruct users to submit an email to the older email address.   After a period of time passes to allow users to transition to the new email address, you can edit your rules to remove references to the older mailbox.   Lastly, delete the old mailbox.This is done from Â the Oracle Cloud Portal &gt; Configuration Assistant Â options Â to manage your Oracle-Managed Service mailboxes. Â   Please see Configuration of Oracle-hosted Service and Outreach mailboxes Â for more information on both of these options."

Always listing an answer first in the search results;Answer ID 2258;Can I have an answer always be first in the list of search results?;['Answer ID 2492', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, Phrase Searching;"  When searching for a word or phrase, the answers on your end-user pages are typically sorted by the weight field, which is a calculation as to how well and how often the search words are used in the answer. That is, the answers that have the highest calculated weights are listed first in the results with answers that have lower weights displaying further down in the search results. You can use the  Â Search Priority Words feature to fix an answer to always display with any search that is performed, regardless of whether the answer includes the search term or not. When you configure a priority word with the Always Show checkbox enabled, that answer (or Web document) will always display when a search is performed. The answer will display in a separate section on the answers list page named Recommended Links. The path to configure search priority words/topic words is: Go to Â Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Knowledge Base &gt; Search Priority Words. For more information on setting up Â topic words, refer to Answer 2492: Configuring Topic Words. You can also use the Display Position, and choose Fix at Top, this will Â fix the answer at the top of the list regardless of the search being done.

Dependency conflicts when editing products, staff, custom fields, or queues;Answer ID 2260;When I edit some custom fields or products and categories, why do I get a message indicating there is a dependency conflict?;['Answer ID 2059', 'Answer ID 1989'];   Dependency conflicts in Products/Catorgies or Custom Fields;  When you try to edit or update certain types of features, the application does a dependency check to determine relationships to other records, such as reports, incidents, answers, and opportunities. This includes custom fields, staff accounts, and product and categories. Â  Note: Beginning with the August '09 release, deleting products and categories will not generate warnings. Dependencies may prohibit you from editing, moving, or deleting Â an item. In order to successfully edit or delete these items, you first address the dependencies that are listed in the pop-up window and remove the condition causing the dependency. For example, you cannot delete a product if answers are assigned to that product. Therefore, you must edit the answers to remove the product assignment. Then, you can delete the product item. Discrepancy conflict messages include the following information:          What: This indicates either View or Rule. If it says View, the dependency could be with either a console view or a custom report. Â            Description: Specifies where the dependency occurs, namely with which record type. For example, Analytics means the issue is with a custom report. Â            Name: Gives the name of Â a specific report or Â view so that you can edit it to remove the field from the filter or criteria. Â            Conflict: This indicates whether the field is included as a filter or is included as a column in the display output. Â            More Info: Specifies which interface has the view or report and identifies who owns the view or report.     Specific Dependency Conflicts  Dependency conflicts may arise with the following features:  Editing custom fields Deleting products or categories Moving products or categories Â in version Â  Â  Disabling staff accounts Deleting a queue Â   Custom Fields: When you remove visibility for a custom field or try to delete a custom field, the system does a dependency check to see if that field is used in views, reports, or business rules. If it is, you will get a pop-up message indicating that there is a dependency conflict that you must resolve before you can edit or delete the field. Therefore, to remove visibility or delete any custom fields, you must open the view, report or rule for editing, determine where the custom field is used (that is, determine where the dependency is), and delete the custom field from the view, report or rule. If the report was created by an active staff member who no longer uses that item, the staff member can simply delete the report if it is no longer in use. If the item is a private report, you may need to ask other staff members as to who owns the report and have them edit it. If the staff member who owns the report is no longer with your company, your site administrator can log in to your Oracle B2C Service application as the Administrator and access the private Â reports and edit or delete them. For more information on the Administrator account, refer to Answer ID 2059: Oracle B2C Service System Administrator account. If your site has multiple interfaces, and if the dependency involves Â a report, log in to the appropriate interface to access the report to remove the dependency. You can also use the Links menu to access the Â administration consoles Â for the appropriate interface. Products and Categories: When deleting a product or category, you will get a dependency conflict message if there are answers that are assigned to that product or category. You cannot delete a product or category if an answer in your site is assigned to that value. Similarly, if you are moving a product or category, you will get a dependency conflict message as well if answers are assigned to that value. The dependency conflict will display the meta-answer ID, not the answer ID. Depending on your site, the meta-answer ID may not be equal to the answer ID. To access the meta-answer, you can do a quick search using the Meta-Answer Search by clicking the arrow next to the Quick Search text and selecting Meta-Answer Search. To find all answers associated with a product or category, create a report or view that includes the product or category hierarchy as a run-time filter and use that view to search for all answers assigned to a specific value. If you are not using product linking in your interface, once you have searched for all answers associated with that value, you can mass edit the answers to clear the product or category from being associated to that group of answers. If product linking is enabled for your interface, you must edit each meta-answer / answer individually. Disabling staff accounts: When you disable a staff account, you can also get a dependency message if a rule exists that automatically assigns records to that staff account. In this case, you must edit the appropriate rule(s) and then activate the ruleset before you can disable that staff account. Deleting Queues: When you delete a queue, you can also get a dependency message if a rule exists that automatically assigns records to that queue. In this case, you must edit the appropriate rule(s) and then activate the ruleset before you can delete the queue. Â  Â Before deleting a queue, please review Â  Answer ID 1989: Deleting an Incident Queue. Â

Using Outreach Campaigns;Answer ID 2263;What is an Outreach campaign?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Campaigns Outreach and Feedback Oracle B2C Service;"  Campaigns allow you to create dynamic, multiple-step email marketing campaigns through a graphical Â interface. For example, you can use a campaign to launch and follow-up on a sales convention, Â send invitations out to Â contacts, direct them to a registration form, track their attendance and send follow up emails. There are several contextual buttons in the Display section of the campaign designer ribbon that contain important fields for creating a new campaign: Details Â - In the details section, you can assign the campaign to a specific staff member and define the start and end dates for the campaign. Â  You can define the campaignÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s budget, estimate costs, expected and actual, predict the number of leads and opportunities generated from the campaign. Â  Once the campaign is saved, the Â system will calculate the expected cost Â per lead, cost per opportunity, the net profit Â and ROI. Â  Notes - You may want to add notes to your campaign to provide additional information to staff members as they work with the campaign. Tasks - Assign new or existing tasks to campaigns and edit, delete and forward tasks to other staff members. Results - Once you have saved and run your campaign, you can view the results, which will show you the number of transactions generated by the campaign. Â     Â  August Â 2016 Campaign Designer Interface To create a campaign  To create a new campaign, click File from upper left of console and Â select Campaign in the Â new items section, or open the Campaign Explorer and click New. To edit an existing campaign, open the Campaign Explorer, and right click on the campaign you want to edit. Drag and drop the items you want in your campaign from the Â Toolbox onto the design pane. Test the campaign path by clicking the View menu, and selecting Validation Results. Â  If there are any errors, an exclamation point will be on the item in error. Â  Â Mouse over the exclamation point and the error message will appear. Once you have created or edited your campaign, click Save or Save and Close. Â After the campaign is created and launched, Â contacts are processed based on their actions. Â  You can export an image of your campaign by selecting the Export option; this option is located differently based on the version.

Keyword Search report shows 0 answers even though answers exist;Answer ID 2264;When I search on a specific word,Ã‚Â several answers found, but Keyword Search report shows zero. Why?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Analytics, Keyword Searching Issue  TheÃ‚Â Keyword Search report listsÃ‚Â search words that indicate there are 0 answers returned for that search. When I search on that word, are there several answers found.; The search results listed in the Keyword Search report are based on the actual search performed by your end-user. Â This may include selecting Products, Categories, or other filters enabled on your end-user pages. As a result, when the user searched on a word or phrase, they may have also set the filters to a particular value that resulted in 0 answers when both the search phrase and filters were in effect. However, when the Keyword Search report is generated, if you click on the Answers column and then click the Search String, the answers that are returned are based on a search that does not restrict the output by Product or Category fields set during the actual search. As a result, answers are found based on an overall search that is not restricted based on the fields used by the end-user. For this reason, all answers that match the general, unrestricted phrase search based on that word or phrase are listed. This number may be significantly more than the number listed in the report. Therefore, in cases where a word or phrase shows 0 for the number of answers and you know that there are in fact answers published that match that search string, this indicates that the user also selected a specific product or category that prevented the answers from being returned in the search.

Using custom scripts with reports;Answer ID 2284;Can I use custom scripts with reports in our Oracle B2C Service application?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Custom Scripts in Analytics;"  When creating custom reports in Oracle B2C Service, there are numerous features included to allow users the ability to customize and configure custom reports. Most users will be able to define and create reports using the features within the Oracle B2C Service application itself. The custom scripts feature allows you to define a specific PHP script that is run when the report is generated. This allows you to further act on, manipulate, and format the data in your report -- even beyond the standard features available. For example, custom scripts can be used to convert a row of data into a table, remove unwanted data, or create a link to another page. Analytics custom script functionality is Â not Â intended, and should not be used for any other purpose, Â such as for running PHP scripts on a report schedule (instead of using a custom CRON configuration) or for making public API requests. Custom scripts must be written in PHP. Therefore, you should not attempt to create or implement a custom script unless you are familiar with the PHP scripting language and programming concepts. For official documentation and information on PHP, refer to http://www.php.net/. Note: Custom scripts only run while using the report from the Â Oracle B2C Service console. These same reports do not run the custom scripts while used from the Customer Portal Pages. To add a custom script to a report:  Open the report you want to edit. Select the output level you want to add the custom script to from the Level drop-down menu at the top of the report design center. Click the Level tab. Click the Custom Scripts button to open the Custom Script editor. If the output level already has a custom script, the editor displays the custom script for editing.     From the Initialization tab, type the script executed before the report is processed. This script is executed once when the report starts to process. Click the Headers tab. Type the script that runs during the start process. This script is called once while passing the column headings. The $headers parameter is an array that contains the column headers for the report. For example:  Array ( [0] =&gt; Account ID [1] =&gt; Full Name )  You could manipulate this array by changing, adding, or removing column headers. The resulting array displays as column headers in the report.   Click the Process tab. Type the script that runs while the report is generating. This script is called with each row passing the row data. The $rows parameter is a nested array, allowing you to return a ""table"" of data rather than just a row. Initially, the $rows parameter contains only data in the first row of the table ($rows[0][$i]). Each data cell contains a val variable that holds the value of the data cell. It can also contain a URL variable that contains a link for the data cell. For example:  $rows[0][0]-&gt;val = $rows[0][0]-&gt;val + 22; $rows[0][1]-&gt;val = 'Link'; $rows[0][1]-&gt;url = 'http://vendorurl.com/';  This code requires that the first column in the report is an integer type, and that the second column is a string type. The URL variable can be assigned to a cell of any data type, but the val variable must be assigned a value that matches the cell data type.   Click the Finish tab. Type the script that runs during the exit process. This script is called after the rows have been processed. The Finish script returns the $exit_obj variable, which is added to the report after each row of the Process script. Click the OK button to apply your custom script to your output level. To remove a custom script, click the Level tab, click the Edit button, and click Remove. Click Yes at the removal confirmation. Click the arrow on the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar and select a save option.  For an example of custom script code, refer to standard report ""Visit Activity"" (report ID 46). To view the custom script right-click on the report from the Reports Explorer and select Â ""View Â Definition"". The custom script code is located at the bottom of the report definition. For additional information, refer to the 'Create a custom script' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Troubleshooting custom scripts requires the involvement of Oracle Consulting. Associated fees for troubleshooting custom scripts must be coordinated through your Sales Account Manager. Notes: -- The CUSTOM_SCRIPT_DATA_SIZE configuration setting limits the size of the data buffer. If many null value rows are seen, this value may need to be increased. Further, increasing the value of this configuration can eliminate errors observed when running reports. These errors, when encountered in the agent console on running reports, can show up as follows: ""Unable to Communicate with Server"" ""Unexpected end of file has occurred"" ""The 'exec_rv' start tag on line 7 position 8 does not match the end tag of 'php_header'. Line 10, position 16."" -- You can define PHP functions in the Initialization tab that may then be called from any of the other tabs. -- You may remove any given row by unsetting it in the Process tab (unset($rows[0])). -- The $rows[0] variable is a little misleading, as it is plural, but only contains a singular row being processed."

Market testing modes;Answer ID 2285;What is the difference between Even Split, Sampling, and Random Sampling market test modes?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Market testing Oracle B2C Service, Outreach and Feedback;  You can use market testing to fine tune your mailings for a more effective marketing strategy. By sending the mailing to smaller subsets of your audience, you can gauge the response and modify the message to make it more effective before sending it to the audience as a whole. You can change the market testing mode only before the mailing has been sent and the delivery status is either Draft or Suspended.  Even Split: Â This mode sends your test messages to equal portions of your audience. For example, if you created four messages, each message would be sent to twenty-five percent of your audience. In this way, you can test different content and designs for use if future mailings. Â When you press 'Send' each message will automatically send to their portion of the audience. Â  Â The messages send individually with the next message starting automatically once the previous message has completed sending to its portion.   Sampling: This mode sends test messages to a percentage of the audience you specify. After the test messages are sent, you send a final message to remaining audience members. For example, you could send tow messages to five percent of your audience each. After determining the most effective message, you would send a final message to any audience members who had not received a test message. Â    None: Use None to send a single message to all contacts who receive the transactional mailing.  When you change from Even Split or Sampling to None, a prompt asks you which message to keep. Â  Select the appropriate message. Other sampling Â messages are deleted. Mailing content and proof history for the discarded messages are also lost when switching from Even Split or Sampling to None. To change the market testing mode: Â   From the Mailings screen, click on the mailing you want to change. On the messages tab of an open mailing, click the information bar (just above the From address field) and select Change Market Testing Mode. The Select Market Testing Mode window opens. You can also access this window on the Summary tab by clicking Change next to Market Testing. To send a test message to equal portions of your audience, select the Even Split radio button. To send a test message to a percentage of your audience, select the Random Sampling radio button. To deactivate market testing, select the None radio button. Click the OK button.

Organizing the sales team into territories;Answer ID 2289;How do I organize my sales team into territories?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Sales Territories Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service;"  Territories are used to define particular geographical areas as sales regions. You can configure a system of sales territories to work in conjunction with your organization's sales goals for a defined sales period. You can add twelve additional levels of territories to Â Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service to further delineate the territories. For example, you could have an Eastern territory with specific states or cities as additional levels. Sales representatives can select a territory on the Summary tab when adding or editing an opportunity. When adding or editing a staff account, you can specify a territory for that staff member so that when they create a new opportunity, their territory is pre-set.  Â  To add or edit a territory or additional level use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, click Â Opportunity Tracking Â &gt; Territories. Â   Â  Click Â the New button Â on the ribbon to Add Â  an new Territory. To edit a territory, click on the territory in the left panel. Â   Â  Enter the Common Name and Language Name. Enable the visibility for the appropriate interface. If you wish, add notes to define the territory. Â   Â  Click Save. Â   Â  To add multiple parent territories in the same session, you must first press Ctrl and click the highlighted territory in the tree before clicking the New button. Â  Â  To add an additional level to a territory, right-click the territory in the left panel and select Add Sub-Territory. Fill out the fields for the sub-territory.  When editing a territory, if any staff accounts are assigned to the territory, they will be listed in a display-only Accounts field.  Â  To reorder a territory: Drag the item in the left panel until a line appears where you want the territory moved. When you release the mouse button, the territory will appear in its new position in the territory hierarchy.  Â  To move a territory to be a sub-territory of another item: Drag the item to its new location. Note that the length of the line will change based on the level or you can drop the sub-item on the parent value. When changing the level of the territory, you must specify which opportunities will be moved with the territory. When the Update Opportunity window open, select whether all opportunities, active opportunities or no opportunities should be updated based on the new territory hierarchy and click Save.  Â  To delete a territory or additional level: right-click the item in the left panel and select Delete. A dialog window will ask you to confirm the deletion. Click the OK button to confirm the deletion. To delete a territory that has additional levels, you must first delete the sub-levels before you can delete the parent territory. Important! When you delete a territory that has opportunities associated with it, the territory is set to No Value for those opportunities. When the opportunity is next updated, you must select a new territory. In addition, deleting a territory will delete all additional levels associated with it. Use caution when deleting territories.

Associating multiple incidents together;Answer ID 2295;How can we link multiple incidents to one another?;['Answer ID 2005'];   Incidents Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  In the Â Oracle B2C Service Console, reference numbers added to an incident thread are a link. When the Â staff member Â clicks the link, the incident with that reference number opens in a new tab. Even in edit mode before the incident is saved, numbers with a reference number format are links. The reference number can be added to the Customer Entry, Notes, or Response field. Â  This allows you to add related reference numbers to the Notes area if you wish to establish relationships between incidents without having them visible to the end-user. Â  When viewed from the Account - Â Support History page, reference numbers included in the customer or response threads are not links. This functionality is used only on the administration pages. If you Â include a reference number for an incident that has been deleted or does not exist in your site, Â the staff member sees a pop-up window indicating that the reference number is not valid.

Determining the number of records that meet a certain condition;Answer ID 2301;In my report, how can I count the number of records that meet a certain criteria?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics Oracle B2C Service;"  Sometimes when creating reports, you need to report the count of records that meet a specific condition, such as the number of incidents in a certain status, or the number of incidents associated with a particular product, or those with solution times under a certain amount of time. To count records with a specific condition, you can embed an IF clause within a SUM statement as the expression for your output column. The expression is: sum(if(&lt;conditions of what you are counting&gt;, 1, 0)) This expression says that if the condition is met, then count it, otherwise do not count it. Basically, whenever a record meets the conditions, it tallies a ""1"". Then, the sum statement adds up all the ""1"" values to get the count and that overall count is reported in the output column. For example, the expressions below can be used in several ways:        sum(if(incidents.status_type='Unresolved'|  incidents.status_type='Waiting', 1, 0)) Â     This counts how many incidents are Waiting or Unresolved.   Â        sum(if(incidents.prod_lvl1='Fruit' &amp; incidents.prod_lvl2='Apple', 1, 0))    This counts how many incidents are associated with the product value of Fruit and the sub-product Apple.   Â        sum(if(date_diff(incidents.closed, incidents.created) &lt; 86400, 1, 0))    This counts how many incidents were solved within 1 day (86400 seconds).

Our secondary interface did not send the Outreach mailing;Answer ID 2303;How can I make sure ourÃ‚Â Outreach mailings are sent from our secondary interface?;['Answer ID 331'];   Outreach, Feedback, Mailboxes;  If you are using Â Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service Â across multiple interfaces, ensure that separate mailboxes have been configured per interface. For secondary interfaces, Â Oracle B2C Service Technical Support can create a hosted Outreach mailbox for your use. Refer to Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service Â for more information on this process. Â  You can then add Â that mailbox to your Outreach Mailboxes table. If you had tried to send a mailing from an interface that did not have an Outreach mailbox configured in the Outreach Mailboxes table, you can relaunch that mailing by editing the mailing, setting it to launch and saving the mailing. This will trigger the mailer to send those messages.

Contacts see different privileged access information;Answer ID 2305;Why aren't contacts seeing the same privileged access information?;['Answer ID 1838', 'Answer ID 1779', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Contacts, Privileged Access, SLAs Oracle B2C Service;  With regard to privileged access, if contacts have the same Service Level Â Agreement Â (SLA) applied to them but can see different content and answers, this indicates that the SLA has been edited since it was applied to one of the contacts. That is, if you apply an SLA to a contact and then edit the SLA, if you then apply that SLA to another contact, the two contacts may actually have different privileges depending on how the SLA was edited -- even though the name of the SLA has not changed. This can happen regardless of whether the SLA is applied to a contact record or the organization record. To evaluate this, open each record and click on the SLA field on the Organization or Contact tab. In the SLA Edit pop-up window, note and compare the Active Date fields for each of the records. If the dates are different for each record, this indicates that the SLA was likely edited sometime between the active dates for the records. As a result, the actual SLA applied to the second record changed from when it was first applied. Note: Whenever an SLA is edited, it is not automatically reapplied to contacts and organizations. For this reason, it is a best practice to NOT edit an SLA once it has been applied to a contact or organization record. Instead, create a new SLA under a different name and apply it to your records accordingly. To reapply an SLA to a contact or organization record, you must first delete the outdated SLA and then apply the updated SLA.  Open the contact or organization record and double click on the SLA field.   In the SLA Edit pop-up window, click Delete next to the SLA and click OK. Â    Then, click OK to close the SLA pop-up window. Â    Save the contact or organization record.   Re-open the contact or organization record and click the SLA field.   Add the SLA to the record. Â Click Add SLA Instance and select the SLA and active date. Â    Click OK to close the SLA window. Â    Then, save the contact or organization record.

Linking categories or dispositions with specific products;Answer ID 2306;How can IÃ‚Â have a list of specific categories display for each of my products?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Products, Categories, Dispositions, LinkingÃ‚Â  Oracle B2C Service;  You can use the product linking feature to link products to specific categories and/or dispositions. For example, one of your products may be linked to the first two categories in your list and another product may be linked to two other categories in the list. When linking is used, only specific categories or dispositions are available when you set the product value. This allows you to basically configure distinct lists of categories and dispositions for the products in your site. Â If Â product Â linking Â is enabled, it is enabled across all interfaces (site wide) -- either product-category Â linking Â or product-disposition linking. For more comprehensive information regarding product/category linking refer to Â the Â 'Linking products, categories and dispositions' section in online documentation. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Product linking affects product-category selections for incidents, chat requests, and answers as well as product-disposition selections for incidents. When working with incidents or answers, when staff members select a product, only the categories that are linked to that product display. Similarly, with incidents, only the dispositions linked to a product display when the product is selected. On the end-user pages, when users search for answers, when they select the product, only the linked categories can be selected for searching. The product linking feature allows staff members and users to select appropriate values from a subset of the overall list of categories or dispositions. As a result, incidents and answers are less likely to be mis-assigned to a category that does not really apply for a specific product. Similarly, if dispositions are linked to products, incidents are more likely to be assigned to a disposition that pertains to the product value. Note: You can select top-level products on the editor, linking occurs only with leaf-level products. If you want to create links for all of a top-level productÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leaf products, you must select each of the leaf products separately instead of selecting only the top-level product. Because linking occurs only between leaf-level products, categories, and dispositions, the links you create while multi-editing do not apply to any top-level products you select, but only to the leaf-level products you select. (However, once you have created links to leaf products, the parent product is implicitly linked.) Linking categories to products is independent of linking dispositions to products, so you can enable one type of linking, no linking, or both types if you wish. When product linking has not been defined or product linking has been disabled, all categories and dispositions are available for any product that is selected. Product linking functions in only one direction: from the product to the categories or dispositions. That is, when you select a product, the categories and dispositions linked to that product are available. However, you cannot select a category or disposition to find all the products linked to it. You also cannot link categories to dispositions.  Manual and Automatic Linking  Within Oracle B2C Service, you can either manually define linking relationships between products and the categories or dispositions or you can have Oracle B2C Service automatically generate these links based on current activity and associations in your site. Automatic category linking creates links for every product-category combination in all answers of your knowledge base. Automatic disposition linking creates links for every product-disposition combination in incidents created within the last thirty days. When product-category linking is enabled, the search features in the administrative pages are not affected. Even with product linking enabled, you can select any product and any category from the Search window. Searching on the end-user pages IS affected since the only categories that will show must be linked to the product selected. Similarly, when saving an answer, you must first specify the product value and you can then set the category based on the linked values that display. Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  To Enable linking    Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane.   Double-click Products/Categories/Dispositions under Service.   To enable product-category linking, click the Enable button on the ribbon and select Product-Category Linking.   To enable product-disposition linking, click the Enable button on the ribbon and select Product-Disposition Linking.   Log out and then log back in for the changes to take effect.      Â To create links Manually Â    Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. Double-click Products/Categories/Dispositions under Â Service In the Products column, identify the product you want to link. Right-click the product and select Edit To create category links, click the Category Links button on the ribbon. Select the check boxes for each category that you want to link to the product. Note: If you select a category that has sub-categories, all sub-categories are linked to the product. If you select a sub-category, all levels of its parent category are implicitly linked. To create disposition links, click the Disposition Links button on the ribbon. Select the check boxes for each disposition that you want to link to the product. Note: If you select a disposition that has sub-dispositions, all sub-dispositions are liked to the product. If you select a sub-disposition, all levels of its parent disposition are implicitly linked.  NOTE: You can link categories and dispositions only to products that are leaf products. If the product you select has sub-products, the Category Links and Disposition Links buttons are disabled by the product editor.   Â To create links Automatically Â   IMPORTANT!: Creating links automatically will replace all product-category and product-disposition links (including any you have created manually) with the automatically created links. Carefully review this procedure before creating links automatically.  Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. Double-click Products/Categories/Dispositions under Service To create product-category links automatically, click the Auto-Build button on the ribbon and select Product-Category Links To create product-disposition links automatically, click the Auto-Build button on the ribbon and select Product-Disposition Links   Â To Remove links Â     Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane.   Double-click Products/Categories/Dispositions under Service.   On the Products/Categories/Dispositions editor, select the first product you want to link.   After selecting the last product, right-click and select Edit. The Multi-Edit window opens.   Press the Ctrl key while selecting additional products.

"Enabling ""Other Suggested Searches"" on the end-user pages";Answer ID 2307;"How can I enable the system to recommend ""other suggested searches"" on the end-user pages?";['Answer ID 1960'];  Customer Portal, End-user Pages;" The Â  EU_SUGGESTED_SEARCHES_ENABLE configuration setting enables the application to collect relevant data from end-user searches so that the system will suggest alternate search terms when subsequent users search the end-user pages. When enabled, this feature will include suggested searches when a specific search has been performed three or more times and answers are returned with the search. That is, if a search has zero answers returned, suggested searches will not display. Note: On Customer Portal pages, when this setting is enabled, the feature is included as part of the standard/reports/ResultInfo widget to display the relevant search terms to end-users. To determine the words and phrases to display as suggested searches, the application compares the groups of answers that are returned for each search string. When there is a moderate degree of overlap in the answers returned, the Oracle B2C Service application will suggest the second search string when a user searches for the first string. That is, because there is enough overlap in the groups of answers returned for the two searches, the system automatically suggests the second search string. For example: On a sample site, searching on the word ""dog"" returns 25 answers on the end-user page. Searching on the word ""cat"" returns 20 answers. When the application compares the 25 answer IDs for ""dog"" and 20 answer IDs for ""cat"", if there are enough IDs that are in both search results, then when future users search on ""dog"", then ""cat"" will be recommended as a suggested search term. On a site where end-users do not perform many searches, or where there are not a sufficient number of answers that overlap for different searches, it may be several weeks or months, depending on the site, before sufficient data has been compiled to return Suggested Searches. Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings. Over time, the suggested searches Â generally appear to improve due to more data being evaluated to establish relationships between search terms and phrases and the overlapping effect of the search results. The suggested search terms are based entirely on end-user behavior and is not tied to keyword search logic. The suggested searches reflect the activity of your site visitors. If the EU_SUGGESTED_SEARCHES_ENABLE configuration setting is set to No, this data is still gathered. However, there is a clustering algorithm that must run in order for this feature to work on your end-user pages. It is possible to leave the setting disabled for several weeks, during which time the underlying data would be gathered, then to enable the setting later. Once the clustering algorithm runs for your site, the Suggested Searches would start to be returned, assuming enough data had been gathered for that search word or phrase."

Adding conditional sections to published answers;Answer ID 2309;How do I add a conditional segment to a published answer?;['Answer ID 1838'];   Answers, Conditional Sections, HTML Editor;"  You Â can include conditional sections within an answer so that the section can only be viewed by users who have been granted privileged access to that access level. That is, answers will display public content to general users and the same answer can display additional information to privileged access users when they are logged in to the end-user pages. For example, you might have an answer that contains content for all of your site visitors. For your premier customers, though, you might want to include an additional sentence or paragraph that includes a priority phone number for receiving support. Instead of creating an entirely separate answer for your premier customers, you can simply add a conditional section to your answer so that only people that can view your premier access level will see that content. General users will not be able to see the content of the conditional section. Within an answer, you can have multiple conditional sections defined and those sections can be conditional for different access levels. This allows you to display content for users with different levels of privileged information.  Configuring a Custom Access Level  Conditional sections are used primarily with privileged access. In order to add the conditional section, you must have a custom access level configured for use. When setting up a custom access level for privileged access, use the steps below.  From the Configuration items, select Application Â Appearance &gt; Â Customizable Menus &gt; Answer Access Levels. In the left frame, click on System Menus arrow Â and select Add Answer Access Level. To add a new access level click the New button on the ribbon. Â Do NOT check the Interface Visibility Â checkboxes. Leaving the checkbox blank is what sets the access level for use with privileged access. Click Save. Use the arrows to set the newly created access level above the Everyone and Help access levels.  Note: These steps only address part of the overall configuration for privileged access. For complete instructions for setting up privileged access in your site, refer to Answer ID 1838: Setting up Privileged Access.  Creating an Answer with a Conditional Section  From the HTML Editor: If you are using the HTML editor to create answer content, you can add a conditional section to your answer using the Conditional Section icon. Use the steps below:  Open the answer for editing. From the editor ribbon, click the Conditional Section icon (In 17D and older, this option is available from the Answer Actions toolbox.) Enable the access level(s) that are allowed to view the contents in the section. Â  You can enable multiple access levels if necessary. Within the blue frame that is added to the answer, enter the content specific to your conditional section. Save the answer.  Â   Preview the Answer  Before you publish your answer, you can preview it to determine if you have your conditional sections configured correctly. You can save the answer to a private status type and set the access level to be all of the access levels used in the conditional sections. If there is general information in the answer, you will want to include the Everyone access level. Use the CTRL key to select multiple access levels for your answer. With the status set to a private status, you can preview your answer and the answer will not display on your end-user pages. From the top ribbon, select the Preview command. Â The Access Level field displays at the top of the preview window. Select the access level that you want to view and click Preview. Verify that the conditional sections display correctly for the access level you choose. Set the access level to another level to verify that your conditional sections display or don't display based on the access level you choose. Once you have verified that your conditional sections are working correctly, you can re-edit your answer and set the status to a public status type so that the answer is published to your end-user pages. Once published, the content that displays to your end-users will depend on which access levels that user can view.  Additional Considerations  To edit a conditional section, you can edit the content within the blue box to change the content of your conditional section. To change the access level(s) for the section, double click on the section heading and the access level pop-up box will display. Note: If you do edit the access levels associated with the conditional section, make sure that when you save the answer, the Access Level field has the appropriate access levels selected to match the levels used in your conditional section. You can nest conditional sections within other conditional sections. Place the cursor within the first conditional section and you can click the Access Level Conditional button -- to nest a conditional section within it."

Converting document links automatically to be tracked links;Answer ID 2311;When I create a new document in Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service, are links automatically tracked links?;['Answer ID 1838'];   Outreach, Feedback Document Links, Tracked Links;"  When you add a link to a Â Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service document, the link is not automatically a tracked link in your application. Â  The link must be converted to a tracked link. Tracked links are not available for use with links published in Â answers on the end-user pages.. Untracked links in templates and snippets can also be converted to a tracked link. The application automatically searches for untracked links in the document by searching for HTML anchor tags with an href attribute that do not begin with Ã¢â‚¬Å“mailto:Ã¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“#.Ã¢â‚¬Â In addition, Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service will find links that are part of an image map by searching for HTML area tags with an href attribute. When you save the document, template, or snippet, if there are any links that are not in the format for a tracked link, Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service prompts you to convert them to tracked links. If you confirm that you would like the links converted, a separate window pops up and displays all of the untracked links that are detected. In the window, you can enable or disable specific links from being converted. In addition, the application determines whether the link is valid or broken so that you can correct the URL if necessary. When you click OK in the pop-up window, the enabled links are converted to tracked links within the application. The tracked links are named using the format: Link Text - URL. For example, the link &lt;a href=http://rightnow.com/&gt;RightNow Home Page&lt;/a&gt; will become Ã¢â‚¬Å“RightNow Home Page - rightnow.com.Ã¢â‚¬Â If the link is an image or part of an image map, the name will be ""[Image: &lt;image_name&gt;]Ã¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“[Image Map: &lt;image_name&gt;].Ã¢â‚¬Â Tracked links that are automatically converted are saved to Â sub-folders in the Automatically Generated folder.  The sub-folders use a YYYY-MM-DD format which corresponds to the date the tracked links were generated.    You can drag and drop the link to another folder if you wish. Note: Use caution when automatically creating tracked links. If you include the same link in separate documents as untracked links, multiple tracked links will be created even though they may have the same URL and even the same name. As a result, click-through statistics are tracked separately for each link and are not combined in your reports. To convert links to tracked links within a document, use the steps below:  Create or edit a document, template, or snippet Â that has links in it. The links should have an HTML anchor tag with an href attribute.   Click Save. The Â HTML content Â is scanned and the Tracked Links Conversion message opens if links are found.   Click Yes to convert the links to tracked links.   In the pop-up window, select the links you want to convert by enabling or disabling the check boxes next to each link listed. If necessary, click Edit to modify the link or the name of the link and click OK.   In the pop-up window, click OK to convert the selected links to tracked links.   You can verify your new links by going to the Tracked Links table and selecting the Automatically Generated folder followed by the sub-folder named after your document."

Preventing sequencing issues;Answer ID 2314;Why do our products appear out of order when viewed from different parts of the application?;['Answer ID 1838'];   Administration / Products,Categories / Accounts,Groups  Issue   Our products are out of order when viewed from different parts of the application.Ã‚Â  In the Products table, they are listed alphabetically, but staff see a different order when viewing them from an incident.;  When inconsistencies in the display order of standard drop down menus appear, this can be due to sequencing issues at the database level. Â  Â Symptoms of sequencing issues include: a) Products or Categories are displayed in different orders when viewed in different areas of the product. b) Values appear duplicated within the listing (i.e. groups and accounts). To resolve this, please submit a service request to Ask Technical Support. Â  Â Please include a screen shot and steps to reproduce the issue. Â  Â Technical Support can then correct the issue at the database level. Preventing sequencing issues: Sequencing and ordering issues can occur for a variety of reasons. Â  Â The most common scenarios are where an administration table is locked by one staff member and another staff member overrides the lock and proceeds with making their own edits. Â  Â Another cause is by moving child records between parent records quickly (i.e. moving several staff accounts to different groups). Â  Â For sites with a large list of staff accounts (or any large table listing), moving multiple records quickly can sometimes cause sequencing issues. Â  Â  In general, these can be avoided by staff not overriding locks on tables and/or moving slowly to ensure the page is fully refreshed when making multiple changes within larger tables.

Click-through results percentage for a mailing;Answer ID 2315;How can I determine how many people actually used the tracked link in the mailing?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Outreach, Mailings;  After a document is sent, you can review how often the links within the document were hit from within the mailing that was sent. This allows you to determine which types of links are of greatest interest to your mailing audience. Open the Mailing and click the Results tab. Â  The Tracked Link Activity and Click-Through Activity sections provide insight as to how your recipients acted upon receiving the mailing. In the Click-Through Activity section, click the View Results link in the Action column to see the mailing along with the click-through statistics.  Note: If you do not see the reports above, use the 'Customize List' link to search for and add the activity reports mentioned.  Interpreting the statistics: Within the displayed document, next to each link, a ratio and percentage are listed, such as 203/324 (62%). In this example:  203 represents the number of times the link was clicked Â   Â  324 represents the number of times any link in the document was clicked, that is, this is the total number of clicks for all links in the document Â   Â  62% represents 203 divided by 324, which gives the proportion of times the link was clicked compared to the total number of clicks for the document  Note: The denominator used in the percentage represents the total number of clicks that were made to any link in the document. This does not represent the number of recipients or unique users who opened the mailing or who clicked links within the mailing. If an individual user clicks five links within a document, that counts as 5 clicks toward the total count when viewing the click-through results.  For additional information, refer to the 'View click-through results' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Incidents getting assigned to people who are not logged in;Answer ID 2321;Why do incidents get assigned to people who aren't logged in?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Round Robin Queues, Incident routing Issue  I am testing some rules, and when I submit test incidents, they are often routed to people who are not logged into the system.Ã‚Â  However, incidentÃ‚Â get assigned to people who aren't logged in.; Incidents can be routed directly to staff members, even if those staff members are not currently logged in to the administrative side of Oracle B2C Service. Rules routing directly to staff member: You can configure rules to automatically assign incidents to specific staff members when certain criteria are met. Â Review your incident rules to determine if incidents are being routed directly to specific staff members. It is not possible to configure the rule to only apply if the staff member is logged in. Round-robin assignment: Incidents may be assigned to staff based on round-robin assignments configured in your application. Incidents assigned via round-robin do not take into account whether the staff member is logged in or not. Round-robin (All) You can use rules to assign incidents to queues. If the queue type is configured so that the Round Robin (All) Â is selected, incidents are automatically assigned to staff members whose profile includes the queue, regardless of whether the staff member is logged in to the system or not. All enabled staff whose profile includes the queue will be assigned incidents in a round-robin fashion.  Â  Round-robin (Logged In): You can use rules to assign incidents to queues. If the queue type is configured so that the Round Robin (Logged In) is selected, incidents are automatically assigned to staff members whose profile includes the queue, only when the staff member is logged in to the system. All enabled staff whose profile includes the queue will be assigned incidents in a round-robin fashion.

Moving records out of the null rule state;Answer ID 2324;When activating the incident rules I am presented with the option to moveÃ‚Â a number of incidents in state withÃ‚Â ID value of Null to another rule state.;['Answer ID 5168'];  Business Rules Oracle B2C Service; Records in a Null state will never be affected by rules. You must move the records to another state other than Null. These apply to any type of records that a business rule can be created for. Incidents, answers, contacts, organization rules are a few examples. When you move these records to another state the rules do not run on those records until the records are updated. Â  Â Basically it just moves the records into a rule state so if they Â are ever edited again the rules will be able to execute on the records Â  Â If a Â record remains in a Null rule state then the rules will not ever run on the incident as long as it remains in that Null state. Â  Â  The only thing that will move the records out of the Null state is a direct database update or if you move them when prompted at the time of activating the rules. Â  Â In the case of incidents, it is best not to move the incidents to an initial state since those rules are generally used for newly created incidents and you do not want the incidents to go through the initial rules the next time you edit any of the incidents. Â  Â We recommend moving these incidents to one of your in progress or solved rule states. Â  Â Then if those incidents are ever edited again the rules will have a chance to run on the incidents.

Determining who has logged in to the Oracle B2C Service application;Answer ID 2336;How can I tell which of our staff members have logged in to the Oracle B2C Service application in the last week?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics;"  The Agent Login and Group Login reports allow you to view which staff members have logged in to your Oracle B2C Service application within a time period you specify. These reports are accessed from the Report explorer using the path:  Public Reports &gt; Service folder &gt; Agent Reports folder &gt; Agent Login folder  The Agent Login report (ID 54) includes run-time filters for a date range, agents name and date grouping so that the results are grouped by day, week, month, or year. Â  This allows you to select specific staff accounts of interest to review their login history. The Group Login report (ID 58) includes run-time filters for the date range, the staff group name and date grouping. Â  This allows you to view the login activity for specific staff groups as a whole. For more information about these reports, you can right click on them from the Report Explorer and select to View Definitions. The Report Definitions page provides filters and Â output expressions, along with a description. Custom reports: Â  You can copy the Agent Login or Group Login report and then edit the copy of the report. This allows you to modify the filters and output columns to match different criteria of interest. If you are unable to see expected reports, you may want to check the Analytics permissions associated with your profile.

Removing a suggested search phrase from end-user pages;Answer ID 2339;When an end-user searches on a certain word,Ã‚Â how can we remove one of the suggested search phrases from being returned?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Phrase Searching, Customer Portal Oracle B2C Service;" The EU_SUGGESTED_SEARCHES_ENABLE  Â configuration setting enables the suggested searching functionality. When enabled, this feature will include suggested searches that users have entered previously that results in a similar group of answers being returned with the search results. Defining exclusions for suggested searches: If you search on a word or phrase and determine that one of the suggested searches should not be included in the suggestions, you can include the word in the do_not_suggest.txt file. Â This file contains words which you do not want displayed in Suggested Searches on the end-user Find Answers page. The do_not_suggest.txt Â  file only accepts one word per line, and any suggested searches that contain that word will not be displayed. For example, to prevent ""macintosh apples"" from being returned as a suggested solution, you could add either MACINTOSH or APPLE to the file. This will block any suggested searches containing this word. For example, adding APPLE to the file will prevent Â all of the following from becoming suggested searches: APPLE, MACINTOSH APPLE, GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLE and any other phrase that includes APPLE. To access, the do_not_suggest.txt file, use the path: Configuration menu &gt; System Configuration &gt; File Manager &gt; Switch to: wordlist files. Re-cluster answers: Once entries are added to the do_not_suggest.txt file, your answers will need to be re-clustered. Re-clustering your answers will eventually happen automatically within the application, based on how many changes and edits there have been to your answers. However, you can schedule the re-clustering the next time the agedatabase utility runs to ensure that they are reclustered soon after the do_not_suggest.txt file is edited. Agedatabase runs each night. To schedule reclustering of your answers, use the steps below: Go to Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Knowledge Base &gt; Â Topic Browse. Â   Â  Select an interface Check the box for ""Schedule cluster regeneration""  Clustering will then run overnight. The Cluster Label section of the page is only used if you have Browse enabled on your end-user pages, allowing you to specify the names of different browse clusters. Multiple interfaces: Â  Within the File Manager, files located in the wordlist menu are not interface specific. Each file is language specific. Â  That is, if two interfaces in your site have the same language pack applied, those interfaces share the same wordlist files. Â  As a result, when you add to the do_not_suggest.txt file, if your site has another interface that uses the same language pack, those terms are Â excluded for both interfaces. For example, if two interfaces both have the en_US language pack applied, if you add words to the do_not_suggest.txt file for one interface, those words are also excluded from suggested searches in the other interface that uses the en_US language."

Incidents flagged with #TAG# or #QUAR#;Answer ID 2341;Why are we getting incidents that have #TAG# or #QUAR# in the Subject line?;['Answer ID 2345', 'Answer ID 1595'];  Incoming Email, Barracuda;" If your mailbox is hosted by Oracle B2C Service, incidents are generated with preceding #TAG# or #QUAR# tags depending on how the Barracuda filter is set for the mailbox through which the incident was submitted. For comprehensive information regarding the Barracuda application, refer to Answer ID 2345: Filtering SPAM for Hosted Mailboxes.  Tag, Quarantine, and Block Scores Within the Barracuda filter, you can define a Tag Score, Quarantine Score, and a Block Score. These can be configured from the PREFERENCES: Spam Settings page. The Tag Score specifies the value at which incidents are submitted into the hosted mailbox, but the Subject line is flagged with a prefix of #TAG#. This indicates a threshold at which you would like incoming email incidents to be flagged for further evaluation, but you do not necessarily want them quarantined or blocked. The Quarantine Score is the value at which incoming emails are quarantined in the Quarantine Inbox if Quarantine is enabled. If Quarantine is not enabled, incoming email that exceeds this score is flagged with a prefix of #QUAR# so that these incidents can easily be seen from the Support Console. The Block Score indicates the value at which emails are blocked completely and discarded. Note: To disable any of these three options, set the Score value to 10 and click Save Changes.  Spam Scores for Individual Emails Each email sent to the mailbox receives a Barracuda Spam Score which determines how the email will be handled. By default, each Oracle B2C Service hosted mailbox is configured with a Tag Score of 3.5, a Quarantine Score of 10.0 (disabled) Â and the Block Score set to 9. Â The quarantine feature is disabled so that emails are not actually quarantined. As a result, by default, email with a score Â higher than Â 3.5 Â are flagged with the #TAG# flag in the Subject line. This lets you know that the email exceeded the Tag Score. When Â the quarantine feature disabled and the Quarantine Â Score is set to anything lower than 10, emails exceeding that value are flagged with #QUAR# to indicate that the email exceeded the Quarantine Score. If the quarantine feature were enabled, these emails would have been routed to the Quarantine Inbox instead of having an incident created. You can view the Spam Score for each individual incident by viewing the email headers for that incident. In order to view the headers, they must be enabled within your Oracle B2C Service application. For more information on enabling email headers, refer to Answer ID 1595: Enabling Email Headers. When the headers are enabled, click the envelope icon from the incident thread to view the headers for that email. The Barracuda Spam Score is typically listed towards the bottom of the pop-up along with the Spam Status, which compares the email score to the tag score and quarantine score. For example: X-Barracuda-Spam-Score: 1.58 X-Barracuda-Spam-Status: No, SCORE=1.58 using per-user scores of TAG_LEVEL=3.5 QUARANTINE_LEVEL=7.5 KILL_LEVEL=1000.0 tests=CN_BODY_332, HTML_TAG_BALANCE_BODY, HTML_TAG_EXIST_TBODY, THREAD_INDEX, THREAD_TOPIC In this case, the spam score for the email is 1.58, which is less than the tag score of 3.5 or the quarantine score of 9.0. Note that if you change the tag or quarantine scores, these scores are reflected in the Spam Status section.  Evaluating and Changing Score Thresholds Review the incidents and their spam scores that are flagged with the #TAG# and #QUAR# tags to determine which scores are appropriate thresholds for tagging, quarantining, or even blocking incidents. By reviewing the individual spam scores from these incidents, you can better determine the Tag Score, Quarantine Score, and Block Score. For example, if you determine that there are too many incidents with #TAG#, review the spam scores for those incidents to determine a better threshold and set the Tag Score to a higher value and click Save Changes. In addition, review the spam scores for the incidents that are flagged with #QUAR# and determine if those emails should be quarantined (or even blocked). If you wish, you can enable the quarantine feature from the PREFERENCES: Quarantine Settings page. You can also choose to enable blocking by changing the Block Score to a value other than 10. Note: Exercise caution in setting the Block Score. Once an email is blocked, it is permanently removed and is not delivered and is not accessible. If there is any concern with blocking emails and permanently removing them, it is better to be conservative and have emails tagged or quarantined so that they can be evaluated and reviewed.  Legitimate incidents are being tagged with #TAG# If the spam score is equal to or greater than the Tag Score configured in Barracuda, then the subject of the incident is tagged with #TAG#. However, if you are seeing incidents that have the #TAG# tag, but have a spam score that is less than the Tag Score configured in Barracuda, then Barracuda may have the originating IP address of the email in their system as a ""poor"" reputation. You can easily check this by following these steps: 1) Open the email header for the incident that is being tagged with #TAG#. 2) In the email header, verify that the 'X-Barracuda-Spam-Score' line has a score that is less than the Tag Score that you have configured in Barracuda spam filtering. The default Tag Score is 3.5. If the 'X-Barracuda-Spam-Score' line has a score that is equal to or greater than the Tag Score configured in Barracuda, then Barracuda has determined that this is spam. If the score is less than the Tag Score value then continue on to the next step. 3) Locate the 'X-Barracuda-Connect' line in the email header. You will see an IP address of the mail server that submitted the email. 4) Go to Â http://www.barracudacentral.org/lookups Â and enter the IP address from the previous step into the ""IP Lookup"" field. You will be asked to enter some text from a security image and then submit your query. 5) If the 'IP Lookup' results inform you that the IP address is listed as ""poor"" on the Barracuda Reputation System, this is why the emails from that source are being tagged in Oracle B2C Service. This results page provides you with a form that you can use to request adjustment of the reputation. The Barracuda Reputation System real-time database IP Lookup can be accessed and searched on via the following URL: Â http://www.barracudacentral.org/lookups The following URL contains information of why originating IP addresses can be listed with a ""poor"" reputation: Â http://www.barracudacentral.org/lookups/reason The Oracle B2C Service Hosting group currently tags emails originating from email servers that are listed as ""poor"" instead of deleting them. IP addresses expire from the ""poor"" list when their reputation improves so checking the list in real time will not always show an IP address as being on the ""poor"" list."

Mailbox personal certificate and key settings;Answer ID 2344;How do I identify a mailbox's public certificate/private key file and set certificate import requirements?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Mailboxes, Configuring SMIME security settings;"  The Oracle B2C Service Service mailbox can send S/MIME email using a signature, encryption, or both. To send S/MIME email, the mailbox must be issued a certificate, which includes a public certificate and a private key. The certificate can be obtained from an authorized certification authority and should contain the email address for the mailbox. A certificate is a digital piece of information for email and Internet security that includes the name of the certification authority, the holder of the certificate, the certificate holderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s public key, the dates the certificate is valid, the serial number, and the digital signature of the certification authority. Certificates are also referred to as public certificates. A private key is a password-protected key used by the holder to create digital email signatures and decrypt messages that were encrypted using the holderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s associated public key. A public key is public information that may be attached to email messages to allow those who reply to the message to encrypt their response. However, while technically not a requirement (although some email clients will actually require it) generally you can only encrypt a response if Â smime is configured in your email client Â and you send your own public key back to Oracle B2C Service. The public key also verifies that the digital signature was created with the associated private key, thereby ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the message. Public keys are often referred to as public certificates, although certificates hold additional information besides the public key. S/MIME (Secure / Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Identify the mailboxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s public certificate/private key file and set certificate import requirements. Note, attachments are converted to text and become part of an email.  Â Therefore, they have the same security as the email itself.  Locating the Service Mailbox Personal Certificate and Key  The Â  certificate and key is configured within the service mailbox configured for your site. Â   From the Service Administration Items, select Communication Configuration &gt; Service Mailboxes.   Double click on the mailbox you need to locate the certificate for in the left panel.   Click the Security tab.   In the S/MIME section is listed the Mailbox personal certificate and key.   Click Browse to locate the file containing the public certificate and private key assigned to the mailbox by the certification authority.   The file you import should be in a password-protected Personal Information Exchange PKCS#12 format, using a .pfx or .p12 file extension. It must also contain the email address of the mailbox exactly as it was entered under the Outgoing Email tab.   When prompted, enter the original password (the password used to encrypt the file) and the new password (the password the private key is to be encrypted with in the Oracle B2C Service database).   The file is not imported until you click to save all mailbox security settings.  Note: S/MIME configuration options are not available on Outreach mailboxes.  Adding and Deleting trusted certification authorities Â  Â   Oracle B2C Service Â uses a predefined list of trusted certification authorities for verifying certificates from POP3 servers and S/MIME email senders; this list contains well-known root certification authorities. Depending on your organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s circumstances, you may want to add or delete trusted certification authorities. To add certification authorities: 1. Â  Click the Common Configuration button on the navigation pane. 2.  Â Double-click File Manager under System Configuration. The content pane displays the File Manager. 3. Click the Switch To drop-down menu and select Additional Root Certificates. 4. Click the Browse button and select the root certificate file you want to upload. The file should be in DER Encoded Binary X.509 (.cer or .crt) or Base-64 Encoded X.509 (.pem) format. Â  The Oracle B2C Service application requires that certificates have the correct file extension. Â  Certificates with an incorrect extension will not be used. 5 Click the Go button to upload the file. To delete certification authorities: 1. Double-click File Manager under System Configuration. The content pane displays the File Manager. 2. Click the Switch To drop-down menu and select Additional Root Certificates. A list of files you have uploaded is displayed. 3. Click the Delete File button on the line that contains the file you want to delete. 4. Click the OK button when the warning message is displayed to delete the root certificate file.  Adding certificate revocation lists  Certification is used for security purposes in sending and receiving email. Customers who have S/MIME email can send signed emails to any Oracle B2C Service mailbox. Even if the S/MIME capabilities on the Â Oracle B2C Service mailbox are disabled, reply messages can be encrypted using the customersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ public certificates that are part of their electronic signatures. Customers can then decrypt replies using their private keys. Oracle B2C Service Â is configured with a predefined list of trusted certification authorities for verifying certificates from POP3 servers and S/MIME email senders; this list contains well known root certification authorities and is found in the ca.pem file under the .db directory on your server. Certification authorities regularly publish certificate revocation lists, which you can use to check the validity of certificates. To add certification revocation lists:  From the Common Administration Items, select System Configuration &gt; File Manager. Â    Click the Switch To drop-down menu and select Certificate revocation lists.   Select the certificate revocation list file you want to upload. The file should be in a DER Encoded Binary (.crl) format.   Upload the file.  Note: If you upload any lists, the certificate revocation list checking is automatically enabled. As a result, all root certification authority certificates that are used (in either SSL connections or email certificates) must have a corresponding certificate revocation list. If there is no corresponding list, the certification check fails.  For additional information, refer to the 'Email security overview' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Barracuda Spam filters on hosted Service mailboxes;Answer ID 2345;Does Oracle B2C Service filter Spam for our hosted mailboxes?;['Answer ID 1560', 'Answer ID 313', 'Answer ID 92', 'Answer ID 2100'];   Incoming Email, Spam Filtering, Barracuda;"  Barracuda spam filtering is now available for Service mailboxes hosted by Oracle B2C Service (OSvC). Mailboxes hosted for Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service are not eligible. All incoming email for Service mailboxes pass through the Barracuda Firewall which evaluates each message for viruses as well as Spam urls (intent filtering) as well as sender IP address checking against RBLs (Realtime Blocklists) provided by Barracuda and Spamhaus.org. Emails pass through these services first regardless of spam settings and are subsequently sent through the spam detection engine where per mailbox settings have some effect. To configure the Barracuda settings for an individual mailbox be sure you are logged into cx.rightnow.com. Then go to Site Tools &gt; Hosting Services &gt; Spam Filtering and select the mailbox you want to configure. Any of the specific filter locations can be used. Note: A contact must be designated as a Technical Support Contact to have access to this portal.  The Spam Filtering PDF provides images of the Barracuda Email Security Gateway portal. After logging in, Â select a site, mailbox and filter from the drop down menus Â available and click Submit. Â  If your mailbox has a domain such as abc@mailva.custhelp.com where the 'va' within the domain is the server or pod for which your mailbox is hosted, you will have access to this specific barracuda and may not have access to other barracudas. Â  All mailboxes with a reply-to address with the general @custhelp.com domain (such as abc@custhelp.com) attempt to login to the Â Amsterdam barracudas. Â  You can tell Â where the mailbox is hosted Â by checking the POP Server field as configured in your B2C Service Â site. The POP Server will indicate something like ""mailgbXX"" or ""mailvaXX"" to indicate whether the mailbox Â is in Â Great Britain Â or Virginia respectively. If your Spam filter has been updated the old filter is available as &lt;mailbox&gt;@mailXX-legacy.custhelp.com. Â  You can log into this filter to retrieve past filter settings as changes may not be carried forward with spam filter updates. Email Scoring: Each email sent to the mailbox is given a Barracuda Spam Score. The spam score determines how the email will be handled. Depending on how you configure the filtering for your mailbox, incoming emails can be tagged, quarantined, or blocked entirely. The score for the email is compared to the Tag Score, Quarantine Score, and Block Score that are set on the Preferences: Spam Settings page. The Barracuda Spam Score is included in the email header. To enable email headers in your Oracle B2C Service application, you must enable the EGW_SAVE_EMAIL_HEADERS configuration setting which is accessed from the Configuration Editor. For more information on this setting, refer to Using email headers for troubleshooting in B2C Service.   Default Spam Filter Configurations:      Filter  Score        Â Block  9      Â Quarantine   Â 10 (disabled)      Â Tag   Â 3.5      By default, Spam filtering is enabled for each mailbox. This is due to the Block Score being set to Â 9 on the Preferences: Spam Settings page. Â The default settings for each mailbox is set to have the quarantine feature disabled (set to 10). Â The quarantine feature is set on the Preferences &gt; Quarantine Settings tab. The score defaults for the mailbox are set to tag an email with a spam score of 3.5. As a result, incidents created from emails with a score Â higher than Â 3.5 will include #TAG# in the Summary of the incident.  Description of Spam Filtering Pages  For each mailbox, you can access and configure the following pages and funtionality. For more information, refer to Barracuda Email Security Service User Guide.  Quarantine Inbox When you first click Login for a mailbox, there are two tabs available -- Quarantine Inbox and Preferences. By default, when you first login to a mailbox, you are on the Quarantine Inbox page. This page lists quarantined messages as defined from the Preferences &gt; Quarantine Settings page which is listed below. If Â the Quarantine feature is enabled, quarantined messages will be listed in this area. To view a quarantined message, click anywhere in the row that lists the message. This will pop up a new window containing the message. From this window, you can click View Source to see the message headers. If you determine that the message is spam, it is suggested that you click the check box on the left end of the row and then click the Â Spam button to classify it as such. This helps build a database of messages that look like spam to help future classifications. Similarly, you can check the box on the left and click Not Spam as an indication of message types that are not spam. When you click Not Spam, the message is also delivered to the mailbox. Spam emails are in the quarantine queue for two weeks. During that time, it is your responsibility to empty the queue by either deleting the email or Â delivering the message into the hosted mailbox (which will create the incident in your Oracle B2C Service Â application). Email left in the queue for two weeks are automatically deleted. The timeline towards the top of the page is an indicator as to when the quarantined messages were received. If no quarantined messages have been received, the timeline dates to 1969 based on a UNIX timestamp.  PREFERENCES: Whitelist / Blocklist To modify your whitelist or blocklists, click the PREFERENCES tab at the top of the page. The first option available is the Whitelist/Blocklist page. This option allows you to manage both white lists and block lists for the mailbox. The blocklist feature is the same as the Discard Addresses field that is configured for mailboxes within your Oracle B2C Service Â application through the Mailboxes table. The whitelist option is used to explicitly state addresses from which email will be accepted. This is typically used for addresses that have had items quarantined in the past, and those items were determined to not be spam. That is, if certain email addresses typically have quarantined messages that you determine to not be spam, you can add that email address to the whitelist so that future messages from that address are not quarantined and are allowed in to the box. Note: Email addresses are added individually to the white list or block list feature. It is not possible to upload a group of email addresses into either list. PREFERENCES: Quarantine Settings Also on the Preferences tab, the Quarantine Settings option allows you to specify whether the quarantine is enabled and to set up your quarantine inbox and whether notifications will be sent. By default, the Quarantine feature is disabled due to a default setting of 10. If you wish to enable the quarantine feature, click Â Yes for the Enable Quarantine field and then click Save Change in the heading for that section (the top Save Changes button). You must then adjust the Quarantine spam score, listed under Spam Settings, Â to anything lower than 10. Note: If you change a setting on this page, you must also click Save Changes on the right side of the section heading in order to register those changes. If Â the quarantine feature is disabled, messages will be processed by techmail and will create incidents at the Support Console, but the Subject line of the incident will be tagged with [QUAR] for the emails that have a score that is greater than the Quarantine Score as configured in the Spam Settings. You can also specify where and how often to send notifications regarding new quarantined messages. By default, notifications about the quarantine will be sent to the default mailbox to generate an incident in your site. If you would like these notifications to go to someone else or to a mailing list, you can enter that address in the Notification Address field and then click Save Changes. PREFERENCES: Spam Settings The Spam Settings option on the Preferences tab allows you to disable filtering for a specific mailbox if you do not want to filter your mail. You can edit the Enable Spam Filtering field and then click Save Changes. Note: If you change a setting or score on this page, you must also click Save Changes on the right side of the section heading in order to register those changes. To quarantine spam messages, you must set the Use System Defaults field to No in the Spam Scoring section and then click Save Changes. Then, you can modify the three scoring options in the lower part of the Spam Scoring section. Each email submitted is assigned a score from 0 to 10 as an indicator related to spam, with higher scores indicating that the email is likely spam. Based on the score for the email and how it compares to the three thresholds below, you can tag, quarantine, or block email. The Tag Score specifies the value at which incidents are submitted into the hosted mailbox, but the Subject line is flagged with a prefix of #TAG#. This indicates the threshold at which you would like incoming email incidents to be flagged for further evaluation, but you do not necessarily want them quarantined or blocked. The Quarantine Score is the value at which incoming emails are quarantined in the Quarantine Inbox if Quarantine is enabled. If Quarantine is not enabled, incoming email that exceeds this score is flagged with a prefix of #QUAR# so that these incidents can easily be seen from the Support Console. The Block Score indicates the value at which emails are blocked completely and discarded. Note: To disable any of these three options, set the Score value to 10 and click Save Changes. With regard to blocking mail, the Barracuda application lists a recommended Block Score of 7, which would block emails that have a score higher than 7. However, for your hosted mailboxes, Oracle B2C Service recommends a different approach, in that, the block score is initially set higher. Oracle B2C Service recommends that initially, only those Â with a block score higher than 9 be removed. Note, such messages will be permanently removed and not delivered. To further fine tune filtering, slowly drop the Quarantine Score until you find an appropriate balance where spam is not being delivered to your inbox and few if any messages are being kept in the quarantine. At that point, if you wish, you can lower the Block Score value so that the emails that are being quarantined are instead blocked completely.  Additional Considerations  Virus Filtering: Note that virus filtering is handled separately from the Barracuda application. Virus filtering is enabled by Oracle. These messages are blocked outright and will not be visible in the quarantine for delivery. For more information on virus filtering with hosted mailboxes, refer to Answer ID 92: Virus Scanning on Oracle B2C Service Hosted Mailboxes. Known Spam Signatures: In addition to the filtering options, some spam filtering is automatically enabled for all customers. Barracuda Networks has a list of spam definitions that are updated hourly containing a list of URLs that show up in email that are known signatures of spam. Any message containing these URLs is automatically classified as spam and is blocked -- even if the Enable Spam Filtering option is turned off. Barracuda calls this ""Intent Analysis"". Filtering of Invalid Domains: All email coming into mailboxes hosted on our servers comes through a spam filtering server. This server requires all email to come from valid domains. This server cannot be configured to accept email coming from invalid domains. As a result, if you have previously forward email into your B2C Service hosted mailbox from an address with an invalid domain, those emails are now automatically rejected. Quarantine Notification: To modify the email address where quarantine notifications are sent, click the Preferences tab and click the Quarantine Settings option. Enter the email address (or mailing list address) Â in the Notification Address field and click Save Changes. Features Within the Oracle B2C Service Â Application: In addition to this Barracuda Spam filtering, there are several configuration settings and features within your B2C Service Â application that can be enabled which prevents email from creating new incidents. For more information on these features, refer to Answer ID 2100: Why aren't emails creating incidents?.

Preventing mailings from being sent to opted-out contacts;Answer ID 2350;Why are some mailings and being sent to contacts who have opted out of receiving emails?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 5168'];  Audiences, Global Opt-in; When defining an audience segment, the system-defined global opt-in field is not automatically Â included as a filter in the segment. However, when configuring your mailing, Â there are several options on the Audiences tab. Within a mailing, in the Options section of the Audiences tab, the system defaults to honor both the global opt-in and the Â external suppression list. Â  As a result, with the checkboxes enabled on the Audience tab, the mailing does not get sent to contacts whose global opt-in is set to No or if their email address is included on the global suppression list. Since the mailing allows you to exclude contacts based on the global opt-in and external suppression list, you do not need to add filters for these features when you define your segment. If you have custom opt-in fields to opt contacts in to specific types of mailings, include a filter for the appropriate opt-in field when you define your audience segment.

Purge settings and how they affect our site;Answer ID 2362;How do the purge settings inÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service affect our application?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 5168'];   Configuration, Analytics Oracle B2C Service;"  Configuration settings within the Oracle B2C Service application allow you to configure how long certain types of records and data are retained in your database. Some features generate considerable data that is often useful for just a few months, such as certain statistics or search results. Purging data typically results in better site performance with regard to searching and reports. However, configuring any of these settings to be a value other than 0 causes data to be permanently and irretrievably deleted from the database. Therefore, when evaluating the purge configuration settings, exercise caution. Carefully evaluate and consider how purging data and statistics will affect your site and reporting. The various purge settings in Oracle B2C Service allow you to customize how long some types of data are kept in your database. Read the setting description carefully before modifying any of the purge settings. Each setting begins with a warning similar to: *****WARNING WARNING WARNING ***** Configuring this setting to any number other than zero may cause data and reporting data to be irretrievably deleted from the database. Review the setting description and documentation carefully prior to setting the value. Verify that your organization will have no future need for the data or the need to report on the data exceeding the threshold. *****WARNING WARNING WARNING *****  Some commonly used settings that allow you to purge data from your database are listed below.

Enabling quarantine or blocking for a hosted mailbox;Answer ID 2366;How do I enable emails to be quarantined or blocked for our hosted mailbox?;['Answer ID 2345', 'Answer ID 2341'];  Incoming Email, Barracuda;" With the Barracuda spam filtering that is available for each hosted mailbox, by default, the quarantine feature is disabled and blocking is set to 9. As a result, emails having a block score of 9 and higher will be removed. Note: Depending on how your mailbox is configured within your Oracle B2C Service application, emails may be blocked based on the Discard Addresses and other Discard fields. Exercise caution when enabling adjusting the Block score. Once an email is blocked, it is permanently removed and is not delivered and is not accessible. If there is any concern with permanently blocking emails, you can disabled this feature and Â use the quarantine feature so that those emails are sent to the Quarantine Inbox where they can be reviewed and evaluated. For Â more information regarding the Barracuda application, refer to Answer ID 2345: Filtering SPAM for Hosted Mailboxes. For more information on scoring and setting Tag, Quarantine, and Block scores, refer to Answer ID 2341: Incidents Flagged with #TAG# and #QUAR#.  Enabling the Quarantine Feature Step 1: Enable Spam Filtering: By default, the Enable Spam Filtering option on the PREFERENCES: Spam Settings page should be enabled. Â Access the Â Spam Management Portal Â to confirm. Â If this option has been disabled for some reason, you must re-enable it in order for emails to be either quarantined or blocked. Click Yes and then click Save Changes in the heading line. Step 2: Quarantine Score: To enable the quarantine feature, you must first specify a Quarantine score. This score defines the threshold above which email is quarantined. That is, if the Spam Score calculated for the email is greater than the Quarantine Score, the email will be quarantined. When the email is quarantined, it can be reviewed from the Quarantine Inbox tab. By default, the Quarantine Score has been set to 10, disabled. Setting this to anything lower than 10 enables this feature. To modify the Quarantine Score, click the Preferences tab &gt; Spam Settings. Then, edit the value for Quarantine Score and click the Save Changes button in the Spam Scoring header. Step 3: Enable Quarantine: Next, enable the Quarantine feature. Click the Preferences tab followed by the Quarantine Settings option. In the top section, next to Enable Quarantine, click Yes and then click Save Changes in the Quarantine Enable/Disable heading. If you wish, you can specify who should be notified of email that is in the Quarantine Inbox and also how often the notifications should be sent. Select the appropriate notification interval and also specify the notification address and then click Save Changes in the Quarantine Notification heading.  Enabling the Blocking Feature Step 1: Enable Spam Filtering: By default, the Enable Spam Filtering option on the PREFERENCES: Spam Settings page should be enabled. Verify that this feature is set to Yes. If this option has been disabled for some reason, you must re-enable it in order for emails to be either quarantined or blocked. Click Yes and then click Save Changes in the heading line. Step 2: Block Score: By default, the Block Score is set to 9. The Block Score defines the threshold above which the email is blocked. If the Spam Score calculated for the email is greater than the Block Score, the email is blocked and is not delivered. To modify the Block Score, click the Preferences tab &gt; Spam Settings. Then, edit the value for Block Score and click the Save Changes button in the Spam Scoring header."

When Â a mailing or Â survey Â is launched, it will not be sent to any contacts who have received the maximum number of Â communications (all total, mailings Â and surveys) Â within the designated time period.  Setting default values for Frequency and Recency  Several configuration settings allow you to specify the default values for both the Limit frequency of communication and the Limit recency of communication options on the Audiences tab. You can configure either or both of the check boxes to be enabled by default. Â  You can also set different default values for the numerical values in each of the options. All of the settings listed below Â are accessed from the same path.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For more information on accessing the Configuration Editor and editing settings, refer to Answer ID 1960: Editing Configuration Settings.  Five Â settings affect the Limit frequency of communication option on the Audiences tab:  MAILING_LIMIT_FREQUENCY_DEFAULT: Sets the default value of the Limit Frequency option on the Â Audiences tab for new mailings and surveys.  Â  If enabled, for new mailings and surveys, Â the check box for the frequency option Â on the Audiences tab is enabled by default. Â If disabled, the Â staff member must Â explicitly Â enable the frequency checkbox on the Audiences tab in order to use that feature. Default is disabled (No).   MAILING_LIMIT_FREQUENCY_MSGS: Sets the default value of the number of messages used in the Limit Frequency option on the Audiences tab for new surveys and mailings.   MAILING_LIMIT_FREQUENCY_DAYS: Sets the default value of the number of days used in the Limit Frequency option on the Â Audiences tab for new surveys and mailings.  Two configuration settings affect the Limit recency of communication option on the Audiences tab:  MAILING_LIMIT_RECENCY_DEFAULT: Sets the default value of the Limit Recency option on the Mailing Audiences tab for new mailings and surveys.  If enabled, for new mailings and surveys, Â the check box for the recency option Â on the Audiences tab is enabled by default. Â If disabled, the Â staff member must Â explicitly Â enable the frequency checkbox on the Audiences tab in order to use that feature. Default is disabled (No).   MAILING_LIMIT_RECENCY_DAYS: Sets the default value of the number of days used in the Limit Recency option on the Audiences tab for new surveys and mailings.  Note: Staff may be able to override the default values for the frequency and recency settings in a mailing or survey. If the staff profile has the Modify Frequency Setting and/or the Modify Recency Setting options enabled on either the Outreach tab or the Feedback tab, the staff member can edit the frequency and recency options in a mailing or survey. The following two settings are also available:  MAILING_LIMIT_BY_CHANNEL : Â  Â If enabled, both recency and frequency calculations will only count transactions consistent with the current channel in use. Only Outreach send transactions will be counted when a mailing is being checked, and only Feedback send transactions will be counted for a survey. If disabled, all transactions from both Outreach and Feedback will be tabulated together. Default is disabled (No). MAILING_LIMIT_BY INTERFACE: If enabled, both recency and frequency calculations will only count sent transactions on the current interface. In this mode, transactions on all other interfaces will be ignored when determining whether the email should be sent according to prior communications with the contact. If disabled, recency and frequency calculations will be based on all transactions regardless of interface. Default is disabled (No).

Using content from a non-Oracle B2C Service source for an Outreach document;Answer ID 2377;What is the best way to include externally created contentÃ‚Â in an B2C ServiceÃ‚Â Outreach mailing?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Outreach Oracle B2C Service Issue  We have marketing content that was created outside of the Oracle B2C Service application.Ã‚Â  What is the best way to include that in a Outreach mailing?;" Outreach and survey content must be XHTML 1.1 compliant. Â  Copying HTML content directly into the content pane of an Oracle B2C Service document does not ensure that the code is compliant. If you upload the content, though, instead of copying it, the Oracle B2C Service application cleans the uploaded content to make it 1.1 compliant. Â  Therefore, it is best to upload your non-Oracle B2C Service content. To create an Oracle B2C Service document from a non-Oracle B2C Service source, use the steps below: Save the non-Oracle B2C Service content to a file.  Â  In Oracle B2C Service, from the Content Library, open the Documents explorer and click New from the toolbar.  Â  Click the HTML tab and click Upload HTML Content.  Â  Select the appropriate file and click Open. The content will populate the Design tab.  Â  Note: To view the source code, click the Source tab. Note that additional code surrounds the uploaded code, including a !DOCTYPE statement and opening and closing &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; tags. Â  This content is automatically applied to Oracle B2C Service documents.  Â  From the Design or Source tab, modify the content as appropriate and save the document. If you have 1.1 compliant content, you can copy and paste it into the Source tab directly. Â  If you switch back to the Design tab, the source may be modified to be compliant. Â  If you turn Design mode off from the Profile permissions settings, you can paste the HTML into source mode and save the document. Â  Applying a template: Â  If you want to use a template with content from a non-Oracle B2C Service source, it is Â recommended to upload the non-Oracle B2C Service content first and then apply the template to the document from the HTML tab. You can then easily clean the content to remove duplicate information such as header content that exists in the template and was uploaded."

Optimal sort order for published answers on the end-user page;Answer ID 2379;How can I specify the sort order for several answers fixed at the top of the answer list?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Customer Portal (CP), Analytics, Answers, Search Results Report;" When configuring the report and view for the end-user search pages, Weight should be set to First Sort in descending order, and Computed Score should be the Second Sort in descending order. Â  These sorts allow your search results to display in the most intuitive manner when used by your site visitors. Note: Â  Â By default, all Â Answers reports Â first sort on Weight and then by Â Computed Score. Â  This is true regardless of software version or which end-user page set is used for your site. With this sort Â configuration, if a search is performed on a word or phrase, the results will be sorted by the weight value so that the strongest matches are listed at the top of the list. If a search is not performed, then answers are sorted by the numerical value for the answers based on how it is placed or fixed in the list. This allows you to utilize the Display Position feature as it is designed to be used. In cases where an answer has been fixed to a position, only the computed score is affected. In this case, the computed score and score values Â are not equal, whereas for all other answers the computed score and score are equal in value. For this reason, the computed score should be used when sorting answers on the end-user page. Fixing answers in a position: When you fix several answers in a certain position (such as at the top of your answers list), those answers Â typically have the same computed score value. When multiple answers are saved with the Fix at Top value set for the display position, by default, the answers are listed by answer ID in ascending order -- regardless of the order that they are saved. In order to specify a different order of these multiple fixed at top answers, you can add a third sort value to the end-user page view, such as the date updated or some custom field. That would break the ""tie"" between the computed score values. This additional sort field does not need to be listed as an output column for the view. You can simply add the additional sort criteria. For example, if you include date_updated as a third sort filter in the view, you could edit and save the answers in a specific order to determine the order that they should display. Note that if you were to use date_updated to determine the order, if you do have to edit an answer for content, you might have to save several other answers as well to re-establish the same ordering. If you do include a third sort field, it will affect the sort order across all of your answers in that interface. That is, if you have several answers with the same computed score somewhere else within your overall list, the third sort option would apply there as well to break the tie. However, this impact is minimal, since these answers would be somewhere within the overall list and the specific order within the overall list is not very noticeable. In order to Â configure the sort order for your end-user page view, follow the steps below: From the Configuration &gt; Site Configuration Â &gt; Interfaces, determine which report is listed in the End-User Answers Report field. Â   Â  From the Analytics &gt; Reports explorer, navigate to the report location and right click on the report and select Edit.  Â  From the Home tab, click Sort from the Analyze group. Â  Â  Â   Â  The top two sort fields listed should be Weight and then Computed Score, both in descending order.  Â  Add a third sort field for the report -- such as Date Updated.  Â  Click Save or Save and Close. Note: Â When defining the sort columns, you can only add columns that are included as output columns of your report. The field can be configured to be a hidden column, but it must be included as an output column. Therefore, if the field of interest is not showing when you try to define the sort fields, close the sort window and then drag and drop the field as an output column. Then, right click on the column and select Hide Column. Now, you can add that field as a sort field."

Improving performance of reports;Answer ID 2380;How can we improve the speed and performance when searching from the administration console?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 1839'];   Oracle B2C Service, Administration Console, Error Log;"  Error Log  If a report fails when it is being executed, or after being queued, an error message will be displayed. You can see additional details about the error by going to the Configuration menu &gt; System Configuration &gt; Error Log. The log's record will contain the exact date and time when the error occurred. You can use the Analyzer button to help determine if a report will be problematic.  Â  Tips for Improving Report Â Queries and Generation  The following principles can be applied to improve the performance of Â reports:  Use as few tables as possible. For example, if the accounts table is not necessary, remove it from the report. Â   Â  When joining tables, use inner joins instead of outer joins whenever possible. Â   Â  If the join between tables is a one-to-many join, use the table with the ""one"" record as the first table and then join the table with the ""many"" records to it. Â  If the join between tables is a one-to-one join, use the table with the fewer records (based on the filtering you intend to use) as the first table and the table with more records as the second table. Â   Â  Use fixed filters wherever possible. Â   Â  Filter the data as early as possible in the configuration. That is, fixed filters are preferred over node filters or group filters. Â   Â  If you never change a run-time filter, make it a fixed filter. Â   Â  Select specific default values for run-time filters. Â   Â  Include all appropriate filters to reduce the dataset to the records of interest. For example, when joining to the transaction table, include the tbl_id and trans_type as fixed filters to restrict the dataset to the specific transaction type for a certain table. Â   Â  Filter on an index whenever possible. Refer to the data dictionary to determine table indexes. Â To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Â   Â  To count the number of records, use count(1) instead of count(*). Similarly, use count(1) when it gives the same result as counting over a specific data element or field, such as count(answers.ans_id). Â   Â  Remove any output field that is not absolutely necessary. Â   Â  Ensure that staff members understand the importance of limiting what they output in a report.It is best practice to configure reports to return the smallest dataset necessary in order to provide the best performance. While pagination can sometimes be used to make reports visually more efficient, it can also be a performance hit on Â the backend so limiting yourself to only the necessary data set is very important.  Â  Additional Â Information: The items below also apply to improving report performance:  Break large reports into smaller reports and use a dashboard to display all reports. Â   Â  Change date filters that use the between operator to use two distinct filters: one filter uses date &gt; value and the other filter uses date &lt; value. Though the query is similar, the processing can be significantly reduced. Â   Â  Avoid using OR connectors ( | ) between filters if possible. With reports, you can frequently convert an OR join into two reports and then use a container to display both reports. Only use Initial Search and Auto Refresh with reports that can only return a limited number of records such as less than a thousand records. Â   Â  If the report is to be used primarily for text searches such as keywords or phrases, add a default text string to the run-time filter such as ""Enter Search String Here"". As a result, the initial search is performed on a specific entry that returns 0 entries instead of having a default configuration that returns thousands of entries.   Additional Considerations  Editing Reports: When editing a report, review the configuration to remove unnecessary tables, filters, or output columns. If you have edited a report to remove filters or output columns, verify that all of the tables are still needed to define the remaining filters or output columns.  Â  Accounts Table: Special consideration should be given to the Accounts table. If the only information you need from the Accounts table is the display name of the Assigned To staff member, you do not actually need to include a join to the Accounts table. For example, if your report Â is based on incidents, use the incidents.assign_acct_id field from the Incidents table to list the staff member's Display Name as it is configured in their staff account. You do not need to use the accounts.full_name field from the accounts table.  Â  Evaluating Types of Joins Used: When possible, use inner joins to join tables within the report. By default, tables are joined with an inner join. While it may be necessary to use an outer join in your report, when possible use the inner join to better restrict which records can be included in the report. For example, when joining the contacts table to the incidents table, since a contact record is required for each incident, you can use an inner join to relate the two tables. That is, for each incident there is a corresponding contact record which allows you to use the inner join. For more information on inner and outer joins, refer to Answer ID 1839: Types of table joins used with reports.  Â  Open Report Without Prompting for Search Parameters: Â  When an initial search is performed for a Â report, the query is run when the report is first selected. Â  Depending on the default settings for the fixed and run-time filters, the initial search may result in querying an entire database table such as all of your incidents or contact records which may be a significantly large number. Therefore, only enable the initial search Â if you know that the number of records to be returned based on the filters is fairly low, such as fewer than 100 records or so. To do so, edit the report, navigate to the Options in the top ribbon Â and enable or disable the Open Report Without Prompting for Search Parameters.  Â  Auto Refresh Option: Â  Â Reports should only use the auto-refresh feature if there are adequate fixed or run-time filters in place so that a limited number of records are returned each time the query is run. The auto-refresh feature is enabled or disabled from Â Options button on the report's ribbon, while the report is opened in edit mode, i.e. Automatically refresh report at a regular interval.  Â  Using Fixed Filters: Â  Where possible, use fixed filters to restrict records to a specific value or range. For example, reports Â that list all of today's solved or updated incidents could use a fixed filter for the status and last updated fields. For sites with multiple interfaces, consider adding fixed filters for the interface or language so that records from only that interface are accessible.  Â  Set Specific Defaults for Run-Time Filters: In cases where a fixed filter is not desirable, you can still set a preferred default value or range for the run-time filters. For example if your Â report uses the date created for an incident as a filter, set the default range to be within the last week or the last month so that the default search will return the most recent incidents that are typically of greatest interest. Including specific default values for your run-time filters reduces the number of rows that the Â query needs to evaluate. You can also include default search values with text run-time filters such as ""enter search text here"". This forces staff members to type in what they are actually looking for before doing a search.  Â  Train Staff to Use Filters Effectively: A report Â can be as streamlined as possible, but still have problems if a user performs a search with all the run-time filter values selected and no specific search text entered. That is, if the staff member sets the run-time filters to search all available options and does not search by specific search text, the query will still be evaluating potentially thousands of rows that are not necessarily of interest. Thus, part of improving Â report performance is to train staff members to use search filters responsibly, and to limit the reports which staff members can access. Some staff members tend to use reports in an attempt Â to get a general overview of records in the database rather than returning a small number of records in order to manage them."

Associating an incident to a different contact record;Answer ID 2382;How do I change an incident to be associated to a different contact?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 1839'];  Contact/Organization association to Incidents; Oracle Service allows you to change the primary contact associated with an incident. If you change the primary contact associated with an incident, the organization information is replaced with the newly-associated contact's organization. If the contact is not associated with an organization, then the organization tab is grayed out with no data. Note: It is not possible to assign group of incidents to another contact record using the standard multi-edit incident workspace. Each incident must be edited individually to change the contact association. You can change the primary contact associated to the incident. After changing the contact, you must still save the incident in order for your change to take affect. From the open incident, click the name listed in the Contact ID field and select Change. In the pop-up window, search for the contact record to associate to. Highlight the new contact and click Select. The contact name for the newly associated contact displays in the Contact ID box. If you wish to remove the previous contact association, go to the Contacts tab. Â  Â Highlight the previous contact and select Remove. From the incident, click Save or Save and Close. Important: Â  By default, when you change the primary contact associated to the incident, the original contact remains associated to the incident as a secondary contact. As a secondary contact, they will still receive copies of all responses sent for the incident. In February 2009 and later releases the initial contact is no longer associated to the incident after a change has been made. You can also remove the original contact after you have changed contacts by clicking the Contact tab and scrolling to the bottom. Then, highlight the original contact's record and select Remove.

Segment or upload count does not match the number of intended recipients;Answer ID 2385;When I compare the count ofÃ‚Â a segment I created to the number of people who receive the mailing, the counts are off.;['Answer ID 2800'];   Outreach/Feedback, Counting a Segment;  When you use the Count / Calculate feature to determine the number of contacts included in your mailing audience, contacts that have invalid email addresses are automatically excluded from the count. The count involved with the segment can change over time due to new contacts added to the application and email addresses becoming invalid Â based on other mailings. Note: This can also occur when you upload contacts. If the record already exists in the database and if the email address is flagged as invalid, the number of contacts you upload may be significantly greater than the number of contacts with valid email addresses. For example, if you upload 1,000 contacts to a list, when you view the contacts in the list, you will see all 1,000 contacts. However, say that 100 of the records already exist in the database and have an invalid email address. When you calculate the count for the list, only 900 will be listed since those records are not flagged as invalid.  Â  Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service automatically flags email addresses that result in a hard bounce as invalid. These display in the console with a red exclamation point. For more information on the types of bounces that can result from mailings, refer to Bounced E-mail message handling. In addition, if the audience is created so that a contact is included multiple times in the audience, that contact is counted only once. The outbound mailing will only be sent once to contacts that are included multiple times in a mailing audience.  Â  When you look at the delivery statistics Â for a specific mailing, these values are fixed based on the transactions that occurred for a specific mailing. The report does not filter out records that currently have invalid email addresses. Â  You can use the Mailing Delivery Analysis report to get delivery and bounce statistics for a specific mailing. Therefore, at the time the mailing was sent, a contact's email may have been valid, but at a later time, another mailing may have been sent to that contact that created a hard bounce and that email address was then flagged as invalid. When that happens, the count associated with the segment as determined by the Count / Calculate Â feature will differ from the number of non-bounced emails sent from your report. For example, Â the delivery statistics for a mailing Â might show that 3210 emails were sent with 825 hard bounces. This results in 2385 emails that were not hard bounces. If you then calculate the segment size, the segment size will most likely be close to 2385, though it might not match exactly. Several contacts are included in multiple segments, and if a mailing was sent that resulted in a hard bounce, the contact record would be flagged with an invalid email address. Since the email address was valid at the time of the initial mailing, the static results from the report would not reflect the current status of the record. As a result, the calculated segment count would exclude the contact record whose email address was later flagged as invalid.

Â  Click the ""Add --&gt;"" button and OK Â to add the selected report to the Results tab. Â  Â Added reports Â will then be available from all surveys.  For transactional surveys sent for incidents, adding the standard Â 'Incident Details by Survey' report may be useful. See also Tracking transactional survey results by agent Â in online documentation.  Once results are generated, you can choose to Â forward or export Â the report using options in the top Ribbon. Â   Topic Monitoring: This is a wizard that helps Â group text responses containing similar content and look for emerging themes (a.k.a. clustering). Â  This feature helps you more easily Â spot trends in text responses to your survey questions.

Exporting mailing addresses for labels;Answer ID 2388;How can our Marketing department print mailing labels from the contact information?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Exporting address data;  It is not possible to Â directly output address data into a format that can be directly printed to mailing labels. However, you can create a custom report to export contact or organization addresses with each address in a single row. You can then convert the format into mailing labels in another application. Create a custom report that includes output columns for the contact or organization name, address, city, state, and zip code. With contact records, the address fields are in the Contacts table. For organization records, you must join the Organization Addresses table to the Organization table so that you can include a filter to specify which type of address (Billing or Shipping) to use. When you generate the report, export the data to Excel or in a .csv format. From Excel or other spreadsheet program, you should be able to do a mail merge to format the addresses into a mailing label format.

Notifications can be sent to individual staff members or to all staff members who are logged in.  Profile permissions: To Â broadcast a notification to Â staff members, you must have the Broadcast Notification Â permission in your staff profile. Â  The Broadcast Notification feature can be enabled on the Â Administration tab. When enabled, the New button is enabled on the Notifications window. In addition, the staff member's navigation set must include the Notifications navigation item. Â  Typically, the Notifications item is added to the Communications Center navigation button.  Sending a broadcast notification: When you Â broadcast a Â notification to other staff members, they will receive a toast notification only. They do not receive an email. Therefore, no mailbox is required for this functionality. You can Â broadcast notifications without having a Service or Outreach mailbox configured, and without RNMD (RightNow Mailer Daemon) Â utility being enabled. To Â broadcast a Â notification:  From the Â admin Console, select Communication Center &gt; Notifications. From the Notifications window, click Â New. To Â broadcast a Â notification to all users, check the ""Send to all logged in Users"" check box. To broadcast a notification to individual users, click the To button and select the users name from the list. Type the message you want sent in the Message field. Click Send Message.  Note: If a notification is sent to an individual user who is not logged in, the user will receive the notification when they do log in. Â  However, they will not receive notifications broadcast to all users logged in. Â  For broadcasts sent to all logged in users, the recipient must be Â logged in at the time the notification was sent. Additionally, the broadcast notification will appear to the logged in agent after they perform most any action within the console (i.e. run or refresh a report, save an incident, etc.)."

Changing the date and time format in the Oracle B2C Service application;Answer ID 2392;How do I change the date format used in the Oracle B2C Service application?;['Answer ID 2368', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Configuration Settings, Changing the Date/Time Format displayed in the console Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  Within your Â Oracle B2C Service application, several configuration settings affect the display of date and time fields throughout the application. These settings affect Â the display format when viewing records from the administration pages as well as end-user display on the Answers, Ask a Question, or My Â Account Overview Â pages. Note: Â Within views and reports, the display format for date/time fields is controlled by the configuration of the output column. When editing the configuration settings below, you will affect all locations in the application that use the setting format for displaying date and time information. For example, if you edit the DTF_TIME setting, the change you make will apply to all fields that use the DTF_TIME format, not just the fields used with specific record types. To remove the time element from fields within the Oracle B2C Service application, you can edit the DTF_TIME setting to be blank. As a result, only the date elements display. The settings below allow you to determine how date/time formats are displayed in records in your Â Oracle B2C Service application. For example, you can specify whether a month displays as a full name or a three-letter abbreviation, such as November or Nov. Note: Once your changes are complete, select Save or Save &amp; Close (if in the Settings Editor). It may also be necessary to log out of Oracle B2C Service and log back in for some configuration setting changes to become active.

It is also used to identify information inserted within the original message, within the block quote area. In May 2009 and later releases the size indicator numbers are always present Â even if you are sending HTML emails out of the Oracle B2C Service system. Â  In previous versions, if the message is sent as HTML enabled as configured from the Messages table, the byte count is not required and the stamp is not included in the outgoing email response. Therefore, to remove this field, you can enable your message as HTML enabled. To access the Messages table, from the Common Configuration menu, select Communication Configuration and then Messages. For text messages, since the system relies on this stamp to update incidents correctly, it cannot be removed from the email.  For more information on this functionality, refer to Answer ID 2017: Disabling the Reply Between the Lines Feature. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

With an Outreach campaign, users go to a blank page after clicking Submit;Answer ID 2419;Why are users being directed to the blank page?;['Answer ID 1960'];"   Outreach Campaign, Thank You Page Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service  Issue   We have an Outreach campaign set up; when users click the submit button, they end up at a blank page instead of the 'thank you' page.";"  Campaigns track activity using the contact record. When a campaign is configured with a web form that does not contain an email address or Login / User ID field (methods used to identify the contact), users submitting the form will be directed to a blank page, even if the campaign directs the user to a Thank You page. Because Outreach cannot identify the contact, the user is directed to a blank page instead of the Thank You page. Therefore, to resolve this issue, include the email address to your form and the sequence of events within your campaign will work as expected. If you do not want to edit your web form to identify the contact, you can modify the RNM_DEFAULT_URL configuration setting. This setting specifies a default URL that is used in cases where a blank page would have otherwise been loaded. Examples of this include: a user attempting to access an action in a suspended campaign; a user submitting a web form and no follow-up page is defined; and a user attempting to access a file attachment that has been disabled. In all cases, the user will be redirected to this URL specified in RNM_DEFAULT_URL automatically. By default, this setting is blank.

Importing records using Data Import Wizard;Answer ID 2427;How do I import records? What format does the data need to be in?;['Answer ID 4191', 'Answer ID 768', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 31', 'Answer ID 4162'];   Data Import Wizard;"  Within the Oracle B2C Service Â application, you can use the Â Data Â Import Wizard Â to add a list of contacts to your Â Oracle B2C Service database. The data must be in a .csv file in order to import the contact information. Using this import tool, you can also Â import other record types such as answers, incidents, Â organizations, and more. Â  For more information on the Data Import Wizard, refer to Answer ID 4191: What is the Data Import feature?. NOTE: In order to access the Data Import Wizard, in the Administration tab of your profile permissions, you will need to select the 'Data Import' option. When this option is not selected, the Data Import options are not available. The Â Data Import Wizard Â helps you map your .csv file to columns in the database table you're importing into Â and checks the file for errors. The wizard also allows you to run external events or business rules on the imported records. The record limit for importing Â is 10,000. Â  If necessary, you can break a large set of records into smaller groupings as necessary and do multiple uploads. To use the Â Data Import Â Wizard, use the steps below. Â For additional information, refer to the 'Importing Data' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Step 1: Prepare the .csv file to upload  Create a .csv file so that each row represents Â one record and each column represents a specific field. You can create a file in Excel and then save it in .csv format. In most cases, the first row are column headers in the .csv file. However, you do not need headers in order to import the data with the Import Wizard. Â  If uploading data for menu fields, you can use the common name of the menu item within your dataset. So, if you have a field named Customer Type with the menu options, Customer, Prospect, or Partner, you can use Customer, Prospect, and Partner in the column for that field. Before uploading the file, review the data to ensure that the data is formatted correctly and that field information is listed correctly. If the cell is blank, it will upload as a null value in the record.  Step 2: Begin the Upload Process  The Data Import Wizard Â is accessed from Configuration &gt; Â Database &gt; Â Data Import Â Wizard. On the first page of the wizard, complete the fields below: CSV File: Type the full path or click Browse to specify the .csv file to upload. Header Location: Set whether the column headers are: in a separate file, the first line of the .csv file, or there are no column headers. Duplicate Records: Select the option for handling duplicate records. If two or more records have the same contact ID (c_id) or the same email address (email, email_alt1, or email_alt2), the records are considered duplicates. When duplicates are found, you can either update the database with the data from the .csv file (select Update Existing Data) or you can retain the data values from the database and not overwrite the content (select Keep Original Data). Â  You can flag duplicates as errors by selecting Record Error. If your staff account is set to receive notifications, the error notification is sent to your Notifications console. Insert Into Contact Â List: Select from the options below to associate all uploaded contact records with an existing contact list or to create a new list. Click Browse to specify an existing list. Click New to create a new list. Stop Import On Error: Check this box to prevent any records from being imported if an error is detected, for example, a missing or incorrectly formatted email address is found in the CSV file. If this check box is not enabled, the import will continue despite any error, and only records without errors will be imported. We recommend that you always have this box enabled so that you can be notified. Run External Events: Select this check box if you want external events to run against the data you are uploading. Run Workflow Rules: Select this check box if you want business rules to run against the data you are uploading. When all of the fields on the first page are set, click Next.  Step 3: Map CSV Columns to Database Fields  On the second page of the Â Import Wizard, you select a template (if applicable) and map the columns to the database. Template: If you have a template defined to map the columns in the file to fields in the database, select the appropriate template. For more information, refer to the 'Data import templates' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently on. Column Mappings: Map the columns from your .csv file to the database fields in the table you're importing into. Within the mapping table, the first column (named Column) is the column names from your .csv file. For each value listed, click in the Field to specify the appropriate database field to map this to. The Ignore on Update check box specifies whether data for existing records should overwrite existing values or be ignored when the data is uploaded. Enable the check box if you want the data to be added for new records, but do not want the data updated for existing records. If you selected Keep Original Contact Data for the Duplicate field on the previous page, then the Ignore on Update field has no effect. Click Next to proceed. The Import Wizard now runs a prescan. Â  Your .csv file will be checked for errors such as incorrectly formatted email addresses. If errors are found, the .csv Data Error panel will be displayed; otherwise, sample output will be displayed. Checking the .csv file can take Â time. For large files, this could take a considerable amount of time. Note: In order for custom fields to be available within the Import Wizard, you will need to enable the admin 'edit' privileges within each custom field, as you are essentially editing these fields when uploading the data. Â  Â You may do this by accessing the custom field(s) in question for editing, and then placing a check mark within the option for admin &gt;&gt; edit. Â  Â After this is enabled your custom fields should be available in the Â Import Wizard.   Step 4: Review Any Errors from the CSV File  If there is an error with the data you are trying to upload, you will see it in Prescan page. This page provides the number of good and bad records in your file along with links to view both the good and bad records. Review the bad records to determine what you need to update in the .csv file. The last column in each row lists the error. For example, ""Value Ã¢â‚¬Ëœxxyyzz.comÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for column Ã¢â‚¬ËœemailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ($3) is not a valid email addressÃ¢â‚¬Â. In this example, $3 is the column number where the error occurred. Note: When using the Import Wizard, you cannot upload more than 500 contacts for an individual organization record. If there are more than 500 contacts for an organization, you will receive a message indicating that there are ""Too many contacts assigned to the same organization in the file."" Review the sample output to verify that the columns of your .csv file are mapped properly to the database fields. If not, click the Back button and return to Step 3 above or click Cancel. If the data is mapped properly, click Next.  Step 5: Proceed with the Import  When you have no errors in the .csv file (or you selected to ignore them and upload only the good records), selecting Next will begin the import process. When the upload is complete, you will see a message indicating that the data has been uploaded successfully along with a summary of the records created (Insert) and updated.  Additional Information Â  If you should receive the error message ""The .csv Â file is too large or does not exist"" when attempting to upload contacts, this is most likely a Â result of Internet Explorer Â settings. Â  Â Please review Answer ID 31: Oracle B2C Service Infrastructure Requirements Â and select the link that corresponds to the version of Oracle B2C Service you're using and follow the instructions for browser settings. Â  You will need to restart Internet Explorer and login to the Oracle B2C Service application after making any changes to these settings. Â  Some users have reported that adding the site to the list of ""trusted sites"" in Internet Explorer remedies the issue. For information on 'duplicate criteria' message, refer to Answer 4162: Duplicate Criteria in Data Import Wizard."

Including a variable on a custom tab, custom link, or browser control URL;Answer ID 2429;When defining a URL for a browser control, custom link or custom tab, how can I include a variable so that users see information that is relevant to their incident, contact, or organization?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle B2C Service;"  When adding a browser control to a workspace or script, you can pass variables as URL parameters to prepopulate field values in the resulting page. You can also include variables when adding custom links to the Links menu. Â  Â  When passed through a parameterized URL, each variable is replaced with the field value from the record (or associated record) that is currently being edited. Variables can be used to pass ID values for certain record types including incidents, answers, contacts, organizations, and staff accounts. They can also pass values from database fields, custom fields, or custom object fields. Â  Â  To pass variables to a target page, build the URL using the standard query-string syntax, as follows: http://server/path?&lt;parameter_1&gt;=&lt;variable&gt;[&amp;&lt;parameter_2&gt;=&lt;variable&gt;[&amp;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦]] The following sections provide descriptions and examples of variables that can be passed from records in Oracle B2C Service through parameterized URLs. Note: Â  Â This function is supported for menu, integer, text field, date, date-time, and yes/no field types. To successfully pass variables through a parameterized URL, the target page must be designed to process and/or display the variables you include. You can use PHP or another HTML-embedded scripting language to perform the task of populating the fields. Â  Â    Passing Record IDs  The following variables can be used to pass the ID value of the current record.   $p_acct_id Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes the account ID of the user currently logged in. $p_c_id Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes the contact ID of the contact you are currently editing or the contact associated with the incident you are currently editing. $p_org_id Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes the organization ID of the organization you are currently editing. $p_refno Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes the reference number of the incident you are currently editing. $p_a_id Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes the answer ID of the answer you are currently editing. $p_m_id Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes the meta-answer ID of the meta-answer or answer you are currently editing. $opportunity.op_id Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes the opportunity ID of the opportunity being edited $p_sid Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Passes the session id of the account   Example: Â  Â The following URL passes the value of the current record's contact ID to a field named contact id. http://www.mydomain.com/myform.php?customer_id=$p_c_id   Passing Database Field Values  The following variables can be used to pass database field values associated with the current record. Database field names and functions are described by the Data Dictionary (Configuration&gt;Database&gt;Data Dictionary). Â  Â Except where indicated, database field values can be passed in Â Oracle B2C Service Â versions 8.0 and higher. Â  Â  $contact.&lt;field_name&gt; Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes contact field values. $org.&lt;field_name&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes organization field values $incident.&lt;field_name&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes incident field values $opportunity.&lt;field_name&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes opportunity field values $p_sid  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Passes the session ID Â  value Example: Â  Â In some cases, you can also specify an object within a field. Â  Â The following URL passes the street portion of the contact address field to a field named street_addr. http://www.mydomain.com/myform.php?street_addr=$contact.street.addr For more information on this refer to the Â 'Passing variables in URL in Browser Control in Custom Workspaces' Â Community post.   Passing Custom Field Values  August 2012 and newer releases You can pass information in the URL Query string using standard query string syntax of the form: &lt;base_URL&gt;?&lt;param_name&gt;=&lt;param_value&gt;&amp;&lt;param_name&gt;=&lt;param_value&gt; You can specify Oracle data in a URL &lt;param_value&gt; as follows:   Contact attributes as $contact.&lt;fieldname&gt;   Organization attributes as $org.&lt;fieldname&gt;   Incident attributes as $incident.&lt;fieldname&gt;   Answer attributes as $answer.&lt;fieldname&gt; (Note: only customer fields and system attributes are supported for answers. Standard fields are not supported.)   Opportunity attributes as $opportunity.&lt;fieldname&gt;   Session ID Â (account session id) Â as $p_sid   You can specify customer fields by name in the URL by replacing &lt;param_name&gt; with the name of the custom field you wish to use. For instance, $object_name.c$field_name. For example, you could pass an incident custom field in a URL as follows: http://server/testpage.php?p_1=$incident.c$text1 For further information, refer to the online documentation for URL Parameters.   Passing Custom Object Field Values  The following variable can be used to pass the value of a custom object field based on the package name, object name, and field name. $package_name$object_name.field_name To find the package name, object name, and field name to use in a custom object field variable, open the Data Dictionary (Configuration&gt;Database&gt;Data Dictionary). Custom object tables are listed in the format package_name$object_name. Â  Â For example, if a custom object named WorkOrder resides in the CO package, it will be listed in the Data Dictionary as CO$WorkOrder. Â  Â You can click the table to see a list of columns (fields) that can be passed in variables. For a column containing menu items, click the column to see the list of items along with the values that represent them. Example: Â  Â The following URL passes information about a field named PaymentType in an object named WorkOrder in the CO package to a field named payment_type. http://www.mydomain.com/myform.php?payment_type=$CO$WorkOrder.PaymentType System/Custom Attribute on the Incident object: Â  Â System attributes can be passed using this syntax: $object_name.package_name$field_name, e.g. $incident.CO$FieldText  Passing variables to custom tabs in the Mailing Editor  You can also pass variables to custom tabs created in the Mailing Editor using the MAILING_EDITOR_TABS configuration setting (found under Rightnow User Interface &gt; Miscellaneous). Â  Â Any field from the mailings table may be passed as a parameter in URLs defined by this setting. Â  Â  Example: Â  Â The following URL uses a merge field to pass the mailing id to a custom page. (tab(""Revenue"",http://www.mydomain.com/revenue/report.php?mailing=$mailing.mailing_id)) See the setting's description in the configuration editor for more information about its use.

Requesting a Web Log;Answer ID 2431;What is a Web Log and how do I generate one for my site?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Web Logs;"  A web log is a document that lists all web hits to a specific interface, for a 24 hour period, between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 GMT. A web log is useful for generic web analysis purposes, and can also be used to track down a specific request to an IP address for security matters. While the web log files are based on 00:00 to 23:59 GMT time, the time stamps for entries in the log are in local data center time. Â  Â For example, if your site is hosted in the Â CA Â data center, the time stamps in the Web Log will be Â Pacific time. To request a Web Log use the steps below:  From the Site Tools Â link from the Support home page, login, then click on the Web Log link, you will be taken to the Current Web Log Requests page. If you have previously requested Web Logs, you will see all current requests for Web Logs and what their status is.   In the upper right hand corner of the Current Web Log Requests page, click the Request Calendar link.   Click on the day you want the Web Log generated for. You can request a log only from the dates displayed in a different color.  Note: You can only request logs for one day at a time. You cannot request a log for a span of days.   Once you click on a date, choose the sites/interfaces from the list, then click the check box at the far right for each interface you want to generate a log for.   At the bottom of that page will be a drop down menu that you can use to select what format to use for the log. There are two supported formats; Common and Combined. The definitions for these formats can be viewed at the Apache web site: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#common http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#combined   You will receive an email notification once the log has been generated.   To download the log once it has been generated, go to the Current Requests page, click on the link in the green row.   The log files will be standard UNIX format text files that have been compressed. To view the log, uncompress them with the utility of your choosing and then open them with a program such as Microsoft Wordpad.  There are factors that can cause the generation of a log to take more than an hour. These factors include the amount of traffic your site gets and how many other requests are in the queue. While logs can be a useful tool only 12 requests at any one time for a domain name are allowed. Any request that sits in the queue for more than 7 days will be automatically removed."

Using different run-time parameters for reports in a dashboard;Answer ID 2436;How can I have different run-time parameters for reports in the same dashboard?;['Answer ID 1954'];  Analytics, Run-time Filters in Dashboards Oracle B2C Service, All versions; When running multiple reports in the same dashboard, run-time filters for the same field can either be combined across the reports or each filter can be Â listed separately for each report. Â For example, if you want one report to list unresolved incidents created in the previous week and another report to list waiting incidents, you can use a run-time filter for incident status in each report, but not have those filters combined in the Search window. To indicate whether the run-time filters should be combined: 1. Open the dashboard for editing.  Â  Â  2. From the Home tab, select the Options button and enable or disable the Combine Filters on the Same Field in Search Dialog item. 3. Save the dashboard When the Combine Filters check box is enabled, filters shared across reports are listed at the top of the Search window under the Common Filters heading. Filters for each specific report are listed below the common filter. When the Combine Filters check box is disabled, the filters for each report are listed separately under a heading for that report name. For example, if incident status is included as a filter for multiple reports and the Combine Filters box is clear, the status filter is listed separately under each report heading and each filter can be set independently for the different reports. Dashboards honor fixed filters as they are configured in each report. Since you cannot edit fixed filters at run-time, the report generates the reports in the dashboard Â using the criteria set in the fixed filters.

Creating and customizing navigation sets;Answer ID 2439;How do I create navigation sets for our staff?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Navigation sets, Tool Window;"  Navigation sets are the visual layout and accessible items in the Oracle B2C Service Console when a staff member logs in. Navigation sets are specified in the staff profile. They control which buttons, reports, and explorers a staff member sees in Â the left side of the Â console screen. Â  They are also specific to an interface. A navigation set consists of the following:  Navigation panes are Â the distinct sections of the console, including the navigation buttons, Â Home Items, Recent Items, and Outlook Items.  Â  Note: Â Outlook items are visible only Â if you have Outlook Integration enabled and configured.   Navigation buttons are the features listed in the left pane that allow access to the different types of records and reports in your site. When the navigation pane is collapsed, Â each button displays as an icon.   Navigation lists are the list of reports and items within a navigation pane. Â  One example of a navigation list is the list of incident reports that displays Â when the staff member clicks the Incidents button.   Configuring Navigation Sets  Administrators can add and edit navigation sets if their staff profile has the Business Process Settings option enabled on the Common tab in their staff profile. When creating a navigation set, you define which navigation buttons are available and which reports and components are listed for each button. For example, the Notifications component allows staff to view the notifications that are sent to them when an incident is assigned or reassigned. If Outlook Integration is configured for your site, you can include Outlook components, including the Inbox and Sent Items folder within a navigation set. To add or edit a navigation set:  From the Â Configuration items, Â click Application Appearance &gt; Navigation Sets. Â    To create a new navigation set, Â click New in the toolbar. You can also right click on a navigation set in the Â right frame and select Copy.  Â  To edit an existing navigation set, right click on the item in the right frame and select Open Â or double click on the item. Â  Â    In the navigation editor, click a button on the left and drag and drop reports and Â components from the list in the right frame. Â    Click the Quick Search button to define which reports are included in the Quick Search Â menu.   To disable certain buttons, click the down arrow in the lower right corner Â of the left frame and select Navigation Pane Options. Disable the check boxes next to the buttons to be disabled and click OK. Â    Click Save or Save and Close.  If a new navigation set was created, then it must be applied to a profile to take effect. To do this, go to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles. Open the profile you wish to apply the new navigation set to.  Â In the Interfaces table &gt; Navigation Set column, search for and select the new navigation set.  Â Save the profile for the change to apply. Note: Â Agents Â must log out and then back in for the new Navigation Set Â to take affect.  Customizing Navigation Sets  Staff profiles Â can be configured to Â allow staff to customize their navigation sets. The Customize Navigation Set check box on the profile's Common tab Â allows staff to add and remove reports from the Â navigation lists for each of the tabs that display when they log in. Â  If the staff member has the ability to customize their navigation set, Â a Customize List... link displays in the items list. Â In addition, when the staff member right clicks on an item, the Â Remove from List option displays For staff whose profile allows them to customize their navigation set, the navigation set specified in the profile define the initial Â configuration used by the staff member. From that basis, staff can add and remove items as they wish. If an administrator edits a navigation set from the Common Administration items, changes to the navigation set are not updated for staff members who can customize their Â navigation set.  Â Instead, staff must add or remove the item themselves when they are logged in. Staff can Â add items to Â a navigation list with the following steps:  Click the Â button on the navigation pane that you wish to customize the list for. Click Â Customize List... Add the Â items from the full Â list of reports to the navigation list. Drag and drop the items in the order to be displayed. Click OK.  The navigation pane refreshes to display the new items in their proper order. Â  Staff can Â remove items from a navigation list by Â right clicking on the item and selecting Remove from List.  Adding a web site URL to navigation sets A Â web site URL can be added to a navigation set. Â  Â A web page can now be embedded on the navigation pane. Â  Staff members can choose to have Â the new navigation section Â display or not display by selecting the check box Â in the Navigation Pane options under Tool Windows. Â  Note: The web URL added affects the entire interface, and cannot be changed by staff members who don't have administrative permissions. Â   To add a custom web site to navigation set:  Path to setting(s): Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.&gt; NAVPANE_CUSTOM_WEB_CONTROL_URL Â  Â  Input the value of the web site URL, for example: http://www.google.com.

Fill Inbox button is not pulling incidents to the staff member;Answer ID 2446;Why isn't the Fill Inbox button pulling incidents to the staff member?;['Answer ID 1873'];  Analytics, My Inbox - Fill function; The Fill Inbox button displays for staff members whose profile specifies queues from which they can pull incidents and the profile allows incident editing. Â  Â When the staff profile is configured properly to allow incidents to be pulled the Fill Inbox button displays Â  The Fill Inbox button displays on the Home tab Â for an incident report Â generated at the RightNow Console. The Fill Inbox button does not display on the Incident tab of another record, for example, opening a contact record and clicking the Incidents tab. Â   Â  If the staff profile does not indicate any queues on the Service tab, the Fill button Â does not display when the staff member is logged in. In order for an incident to be eligible to be pulled into an agent's inbox, the incident must have the following criteria: The status type is Unresolved. Incidents assigned to the Unresolved and Updated statuses are eligible to be pulled along with incidents assigned to custom Unresolved statuses. Â   Â  The incident is not already assigned to a staff member. Only incidents that are unassigned are eligible to be pulled. Â   Â  The incident is assigned to a queue that the staff member can pull incidents from as set in their staff profile. That is, the incident must first be assigned to an incident queue AND the staff member's profile must specify that queue in the Queues box. Â   Â  The staff member's inbox limit has not been reached already.  Therefore, if an incident is not getting pulled into a staff member's inbox, review the following conditions:   Incidents are Assigned to a Queue: Verify that there are actually unresolved incidents assigned to the queue. You can create a report that includes Queue as a run-time filter and search for all of the unresolved incidents for that queue. Then, if you know a specific incident reference number that you feel should have been pulled, do a quick search on that reference number and verify that the incident is assigned to a queue, is assigned to an Unresolved status type, and is not currently assigned to another staff member. Â   Â   Verify the Profile Includes the Queue: Open the staff member's profile and on the Service tab, verify that the queue is listed in the Incident Queue box. If the queue is not listed on the profile Services tab, select the queue and click the Add New button. In addition, make sure that the pull policy is set to Manual, Strict Priority or First Due. Save the profile. Â  Â   Â   Inbox Limit for the Profile: Check the staff member's profile to determine the limit for the staff member's inbox. If the staff member is close to the limit, when they click the Fill Inbox button, they will pull as many incidents as is allowed up to the inbox limit. When evaluating how many unresolved incidents are assigned to the staff member, be sure to include all statuses with an Unresolved status type. For example, if the inbox limit is 25 incidents and the staff member has 22 unresolved Â incidents in their inbox, when the staff member clicks the Fill button, three incidents will be assigned, even if the pull quantity is 5 incidents. The inbox limit takes precedence over the pull quantity. Â   Â   Multiple Staff pulling from a Queue: If there are many agents working from the same queue, multiple agents can click the Fill Inbox button in a narrow timespan and deplete the unassigned incidents from the queue without realizing that the incidents have already been pulled into another staff member's inbox. For example, if the queue has 12 unassigned incidents and the pull quantity is 5, two staff members could click the Fill button and have 5 incidents assigned. The third staff member would only have 2 incidents assigned since that is all there is left in the queue to assign. If the staff member has a view of the unassigned incidents in the queue, the grid may not have refreshed since the first two staff members clicked Fill. As a result, it would appear that the Fill feature is not working correctly, though it really is. Â   Â   Rules: When the staff member clicks Fill Inbox and incidents are assigned, the incident is actually updated and compared to the incident rules configured in your site. Depending upon how your Rules are configured, the incident could match one of your rules used for initial routing that assigns the incident to the queue and unassigned to a staff member. This is an indication that the incident did not transition from the initial rule state. You can determine if this is happening by using the Rule Log to see what rules acted on the incident and when. For more information on using the Rule Log, refer to Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log to troubleshoot rules.

Creating dashboards to run multiple reports at the same time;Answer ID 2447;What is a dashboard and how do I use it?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics;"  A Â dashboard is any combination of reports and components shown together on the content pane. Â This makes it easy to view and search several reports at the same time. Â  Dashboards are opened from the reports explorer the same way a report is. Â Dashboards show Â current data when opened. Â   Â  There are several dashboards built into the Oracle B2C Service application. Â You can copy and edit these by right clicking on them from the reports explorer. To create a dashboard: Â   Select the Analytics navigation button from your navigation set area. Â Select Reports Explorer, and click New Dashboard from the top ribbon. Â    Drag and drop the reports you want from the Reports Explorer listing to the dashboard design pane, positioning them where you want. Â When you drag a report to the design pane, you will see positioning markers that show you where the report will be placed once you have dropped it. Â  Â    Click Save.  You can change the number of reports in your dashboard by changing the layout. Â Click Home &gt; Â Layouts Â at the top of the window Â and choose the layout you want for your dashboard. Adding more reports to a layout: Â  You can add more reports by doing the following: Â  Â When you drag your report over the top of one of the sections (whether there is a report in it or not), two sets of arrows will show up. Â  Â If you drop the report when the section is red, it will put the report in that section as defined. Â  Â If you drag it over to one of the arrows that are in the center of the section, it will split the section and place the report in the section highlighted in blue. Â  Â The same is true for the outer arrows, but they refer to the entire space rather than just the section in question. Â  Â  Adding other Â Components: Â  In addition to reports, you can also add specific components to a dashboard. Additional components are available at the bottom of the Reports Explorer tab. You can Â drag and drop Â the Notifications component Â to a dashboard to alert staff members of Â notices that come up. Â  If Oracle Service Chat is enabled, you can also Â drag and drop Â a chat component to allow staff members to monitor Â chats.

Assigning workspaces to staff profiles;Answer ID 2451;How do I assign a workspace to a profile?;['Answer ID 2483'];Workspaces / Profile association All versions;" Workspaces define the configuration of the content panes when you view, add or edit any records. Â Each staff member is assigned Â workspaces through the profile assigned to their staff account. Â  When a new profile is created, if a workspace is not specified, Â the standard, system-defined Â workspaces Â are used. If a custom workspace has been created, workspaces are assigned in alphabetical order. Â  For example, in the Service tab in an Account Profile, if no custom workspaces are created, then the default Incident workspace will be used for incidents. Â  However if a workspace was created and named Anna's Incident, then Anna's Incident workspace would be used if you assign it to that profile. Â  There are different workspaces for different record types, including Organizations, Contacts, Service, Sales and Tasks. Â  For example, under the Service tab, there are workspaces for Answers, and workspaces for Incidents. In order to access records Â and Â edit a record using Â a workspace, the profile must grant the ability to edit that record type. Â  To change the workspace assigned to a profile  Â  From the Configuration Items, select Staff Management &gt; Profiles.  Â  Open the profile you want to assign the workspace to either by right clicking on the profile and selecting Edit Profile, or double clicking Â the profile name.

Impact on other records when deleting a sales opportunity;Answer ID 2452;Are contacts, related incidents, notes, tasks, and quotesÃ‚Â deleted when I delete a sales opportunity?;['Answer ID 2483'];  Opportunities;" When a sales opportunity is deleted, quotes, notes, and tasks that are associated with that opportunity are also deleted. The contact record and organization record that are associated with the sales opportunity are NOT deleted. As a result, incidents and other opportunities associated with the contact are not deleted and remain associated to the contact. Prior to deleting an opportunity, you can save copies of quotes and save tasks so that they are not associated with an opportunity. That way, when you delete the opportunity, the copy of a quote is retained elsewhere. Similarly, tasks can be associated to the contact or organization even after the opportunity is deleted. Notes that are associated with an opportunity cannot be disassociated. As a result, notes are deleted with the opportunity. Quotes: To save a quote before deleting the sales opportunity, use the steps below: Open the sales opportunity and click the Quotes tab. Click Edit next to the quote. In the pop-up window, click Edit Quote Document at the bottom of the window. Open an application (such as Word) where you can copy the content of the quote. Highlight all the content of the quote and press CTRL+C (or right click and select Copy). Paste the contents into Word or another application and save the file. Close the Word application. In the Quote window, click Cancel. In the Quote Edit window, click Cancel to return to the Quotes tab. Repeat for other quotes you wish to retain.  Tasks: You can edit a task so that it is not associated to a sales opportunity. To do this, use the steps below: Using a Tasks view or the Task quick search, search for the task of interest. Open the task for editing. For the Opportunity menu, select Clear so that no opportunity is listed in the field. Note that you can change the organization or contact as well. Click Save.  IMPORTANT!

Including controls in a workspace;Answer ID 2457;WhenÃ‚Â creating and editing workspaces, what are controls used for?;['Answer ID 2518', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Workspace Control Items;"  When configuring workspaces, controls allow you to add items that affect the Â layout of items in your workspace. This includes adding features such as Â tab sets, spacers, tables, title bars, panels, and reports. Â  Different types of controls have different type of properties associated with them. For example, when you drag a title bar control into the workspace, you Â can add Â the title in the control. Â  Â You can also control the appearance of the text, including the color, height, and column span. For more information on editing workspace properties, refer to Answer ID 2518: Setting Properties in Workspaces.  Types of controls: Â  The controls listed below can be added to any type of workspace. The control options do not vary for the different types of workspaces available.        Browser: Lets you add a browser window to the workspace. Using the Properties options, you can define the URL for the browser that appears in the workspace.           Panel: Lets you group Â fields or items together in a specific section of the workspace. You can nest a panel within a table and then add multiple fields to the panel, using a scroll bar to view all fields. Â              Report: Inserts Â a report you select into the workspace. The report uses the current record and must contain at least one fixed filter for the primary identification types for the workspace type. For example, reports used in an incident workspace must have a fixed filter on incident ID, contact ID, or organization ID. Â          Spacer: Used to add white space, fill gaps within a workspace, or hold a place for a field you want to insert later. When you create a workspace, spacers have a light gray background to let you know where they are. When a staff member opens a record, the spacers are not visible because they are the same color as the background. You can move or delete a spacer just as you can move and delete other fields and controls. Â            Tab set: Â  Lets you add multiple tab sets or nested tab sets to your workspace. Â  Â  Â            Table: Â  Lets you add a table to form a grid for the workspace or nest one table in another.           Text: Â  Adds a text block. Using the Properties options, you can define the background color, text alignment, and content. The text control is similar to the title bar, except that its default background color and font match the workspace it is used on rather than the heading style used by the title bar. Â              Title Bar: Â  Adds a text block that can be used for headers or sections within tabs, panels, or Â tables. Using the Properties options, you can define the background color, text alignment, and content. By default, the title bar control uses a heading style font and a different background color than the rest of the workspace.      Important: Deleting controls or moving controls to another location can cause vertical or horizontal collapse. Â If the control is the last field in a row, if you remove the item, the row is deleted and vertical collapse occurs. Similarly, if the control is the last field in a column, horizontal collapse occurs, which deletes the column.  To modify controls in a workspace: Â  Open the workspace for editing. From the Common Administration Items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces. Then, in the right frame, right click on the workspace and click Edit. To customize a standard workspace, you must first copy the standard workspace and edit the copy. Then, you must update the appropriate staff profiles to use your newly-created workspace.  To add a control to a workspace: Click the Insert Controls tab from the ribbon and drag and drop the control onto the workspace Â    To move a control: Select the control you want to move, keeping the left mouse button depressed, and drag the control to its new location. Â  Â Release the mouse button to position the control in its new location.   To remove a control: In the workspace, Â click on Â the control you want to delete and Â press Delete or right-click the control and select Delete.   To resize a control, use the Size menu in the ribbon (when available). For additional information, refer to the 'Working with controls' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

This table includes information from a variety of tables (i.e. Contacts, Organizations, Answers, Accounts, Workspace/Workflows, Profiles, Segments, Custom Fields, and more) To determine if certain records have been deleted, you can create a custom report with the following characteristics: Tables / Table Instances: Â  You can select the Deleted Records table and join Â the Accounts (accounts) table to it using an outer join. The tables are added automatically to the report based on the fields you select.  Â  Filters: Include appropriate filters for your report. Recommended filters include a filter on the deletion date (deleted_recs.deleted) to specify a certain date range and include a run-time filter for the Table value (deleted_recs.tbl). The Table value indicates which table the record was deleted from which allows you to specify which type of record was deleted.  Â  Output Columns: Include output columns as necessary. Useful output columns include: Table value Record ID Staff member who deleted the record (accounts.full_name) Date of deletion Record label Deleted Source Hierarchy: Â  The source the record was deleted from, displayed in a hierarchy. Â  Source (del_source_lvl1_source_lvl2) The first and second level sources the record was deleted from, Level 1 sources are the general area of Â  the Oracle B2C Service product, and the Level 2 sources are the specific sections of the Level 1 source. For example, a record could have a Level 1 source of Â CX Console, and a Level 2 source of Opportunity Editor. Â  For more information on creating custom reports, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating Custom Reports. In the Deleted Records table, the ID field represents the numerical database value associated with the record, such as the contact or org ID, the answer ID or the opportunity or incident ID. The ID is not the incident reference number. The Label field includes more specific information about the record. The Label field allows you to more easily determine the specific nature of the record that was deleted. For incidents, the label includes the reference number along with the subject of the incident. The label for opportunities or tasks is the name. For answers, the label is the summary of the answer or meta-answer. With contacts and organizations, the label is the contact or organization name.

Updates to navigation sets do not take effect;Answer ID 2462;Why do staffÃ‚Â not see the changes in the console after modifications toÃ‚Â some navigation setsÃ‚Â have been made?;['Answer ID 2509'];Navigation Sets, Profile Options;" If you update a navigation set and those changes are not implemented when the staff member logs in, this is an indication that the staff member's profile allows them to customize their navigation set. This can be enabled by editing the profile and enabling the Customize Navigation Sets checkbox located in the Interfaces section. Note Changes to Navigation sets may also be implemented by setting the Navigation set back to the default: Click File (top left) and go Options &gt; Navigation Pane &gt; check the box ""Reset Navigation Set to Profile Default"" &gt; choose OK. They should notice a change if they log out and back in.   Staff Â Profile Allows Â Staff to Customize the Navigation Set  Â  If the Customize Navigation Sets button is enabled, in the staff profile, the navigation set in the profile defines the initial navigation configuration used by the staff member. From that basis, staff can add and remove items Â to their navigation set as they wish. If an administrator edits a navigation set from the Configuration items &gt; Application Appearances &gt; Navigation Sets, changes to the navigation set are not updated for staff members who can customize their navigation set. Â  That is, editing a navigation set does not push Â additional items or a customized list to an existing navigation set if staff have the ability to customize their navigation set. Â  Instead, staff members must add or remove the items themselves when they are logged in. Forcing changes to a navigation set: If you determine that you must force the changes to the navigation set out to your staff members, you can do so. Â  However, all customizations made by the staff member will be lost. You can edit the staff profile to use a different navigation set and then edit the profile again and set it to the navigation set that has been modified. Â  When a profile is saved with a different navigation set, that navigation set is pushed out to the staff members and the customized navigation set configured by the staff member is lost. Important! Â  Before modifying the navigation set in a profile, be sure to notify your staff that they will lose their customizations. This allows them the opportunity to review which customizations they have made and document them so that they can more easily customize their navigation set after their profile is modified. In addition, modify the profile during non-peak hours and request that your agents log out temporarily while you modify the profile. Note: Â  If you only have a couple of modifications, consider sending an email to your staff and having them add, remove, or replace certain reports on their own.  Editing reports: If a staff member edits a report that is used as part of a navigation set (the report is used by several staff members), the edits to the report affect all staff who use that report. To prevent this, consider removing the edit privileges for standard reports from the Analytics Â section of the staff profile. For staff groups who can customize their navigation sets, train your staff to not remove or edit standard reports that are to be used and available across all members of that group. This ensures that the common items initially configured in their navigation set remain available to all staff.  Staff Â Cannot Customize their Navigation Set  Â  Administrators can modify the navigation set from the Configuration items &gt; Application Appearances &gt; Navigation Sets Â folder. Staff using that navigation set will see the changes the next time they log in to the application. That is, administrator changes to a navigation set Â ARE pushed to the staff members when their profile does not have the Customize Navigation Set option enabled.  New Items and Profile Permissions Â  Â  When a feature Â is added to the New Items list within a navigation set, staff must have 'create' permissions enabled for that item to be available.  Â  To help illustrate: Agent Adams with Profile A does not have permissions to reports or custom objects. Agent Bryans with Profile B does have all permissions enabled for reports and all custom objects (CO). Both profiles use the same navigation set which has Â 'New Report' and 'New Customer CO' included in the New Items listing.  Â  Result: These items will appear for Agent B when accessing File Menu &gt; New, but will not appear for Agent A."

Including fields in a workspace;Answer ID 2466;Which fields can be included in a workspace?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2483'];   Editing or Creating Workspaces Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  When configuring a workspace, you can add database fields, including custom fields, Â in the workspace. Fields are pieces of information Â from the Â database, such as a contact name, address, or incident subject. In order for staff to view or edit a field, you must include it in the workspace. Each workspace is based on a record type, and each record type has different fields associated with the database table. For example, contact records are stored in the contacts database table, and fields from the contacts table include First Name, Last Name, and Email Address as available fields. Similarly, answer records are stored in the answers table and have fields such as Summary, Status, Language, and Access Level as available fields. When you create a new workspace, the type of workspace you choose determines which fields can be included in the workspace. That is, an answer workspace has different fields available than an incident workspace or a contact workspace. When copying an existing workspace, you can add new fields or more or delete the existing fields to customize the workspace to fit your needs. Certain fields are not available to be added to workspaces. Â  Â If the field is not listed as an available option on the Insert Fields tab in the Ribbon, it cannot be added to the workspace. Â  Â  To modify fields in a workspace: Open the workspace for editing. From the Common Administration Items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces. Then, in the right frame, right click on the workspace and select Edit. To customize a standard workspace, you must first Â copy the workspace and edit the copy. Â Then, you must update the appropriate staff profiles to use your newly-created workspace.  To add a field: Click the Insert Field tab at the top of the page and drag and drop fields onto the workspace.   To move a field: Locate the field on the workspace and drag and drop the field to its new location.   To delete a field: In the workspace, right click on the field and select Delete.  For additional information, refer to the 'Edit a workspace' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Configuring relationship items in workspaces;Answer ID 2469;What are relationship items in workspaces?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2518'];   Workspaces, Relationship Items Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  To add a relationship item to your workspace:  From the Â Configuration items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces/Workflows. Â    From the Workspaces Explorer, right click on the workspace you want to edit and select Open or double click on the workspace. Â    If necessary, add a tab to the workspace. Right click to the left of the first tab and select Add Tab. Â    Relationship items are listed on the Insert Control tab in the workspace designer.   Drag and drop the relationship items onto the tab in the workspace.   Set the properties for the item.   Save the workspace. Â     When configuring workspaces, relationship items Â are specific features and functions that can be added in the workspace for the specific record type. While fields list information from database tables, relationship items include functionality Â specific to the record type of the workspace. Â  Within a workspace, each relationship item can only be added once. Â Typically a relationship item is added to a single tab in the workspace. This allows users to easily view and work with the feature in the tab. For example, in an incident workspace, the relationship items below can be added. Note that these relationship items add considerable functionality when adding or editing incidents.  Audit Log -- this displays the edit history for the incident. Â    Contacts -- this includes the ability to add, edit, and remove contact records associated to the incident. Â    File Attachments -- this allows the ability to add and remove file attachments for the incident. Â    Guided Assistance - gives agents the ability to Search or Select a Guide   Rich Text Incident Thread -- Â this includes the entire functionality around adding and sending incident responses, adding notes or customer entries Â to an incident. The Incident Thread also includes the Smart Assistant, Search Knowledgebase and Standard Text buttons above the response panel. This allows Â staff to format responses, customer entries, and private notes with a variety of HTML attributes.  Â  Â  Tasks -- this allows staff to view, edit, and remove tasks associated with the specific incident. Â    Time Billed -- this allows the staff to add and modify time billed for the incident.    Similarly, in contact workspaces, relationship items can be added to view associated incidents, opportunities, mailing activity, Â and surveys results. Different Â record types have different relationship items available for the workspace. That is, Â a contact workspace Â has different relationship items available Â than an answer or opportunity Â workspace. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. Properties: Â  Each relationship item has properties that can be used to set attributes for that item. Once you add a relationship item to your workspace, you can click on that item and see the available properties for it Properties are listed on the Design tab in the workspace designer. For more information on editing workspace properties, refer to Answer ID 2518: Setting Properties in Workspaces. Multi-edit workspaces: Most multi-edit workspaces do not have relationship items available. However the following multi-edit workspaces may include the relationship items listed:  Multi-edit incident workspaces may include the Incident Thread Â relationship item Â to allow staff to updated and send responses to multiple incidents at the same time. Â    Multi-edit answer workspaces may include the Product Linker item. This allows staff to Â assign different products and categories to groups of answers."

Customizing menu field names in a report;Answer ID 2471;When I runÃ‚Â a report, can I customize the menu item values that are displayed in our report?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics Oracle B2C Service;  When creating reports that include a custom menu field, the specific menu item is restricted to be 40 characters. If you wish to customize the value displayed in your report, you can use the decode function or use embedded IF statements. In general, the decode statement looks like the following: decode(table.c$menu_field_name), #, 'Custom Text Â 1', #2, 'Custom Text Â 2', #3, 'Custom Text Â 3', etc.) You can also embed multiple IF statements, similar to the following format: if(table.c$menu_field_name=#, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMenu Item 1Ã¢â‚¬â„¢, (if(table.c$menu_field_name=#2, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMenu Item 2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢, (if(table.c$menu_field_name=#3, 'Menu Item 3,')))))  Note: To determine the # values in the statements, open the custom field for editing and hover over the menu item. Â  The value that displays in the ID pop-up is the database value to use in the statement. For example, if you have a custom menu field named Severity that you use with incidents, you might have four different menu options to set: Level 1 through Level 4. Within the database, though, these four options correspond to specific menu ID values such as: 6 - Level 1 7 - Level 2 8 - Level 3 9 - Level 4  As a result, if you include the Severity custom field (incidents.c$severity) in the output of your report, you can customize the values that display in your report that correspond to the menu ID values Â 6, 7, 8, and 9. You can use a decode statement for the output column similar to the one below. decode(incidents.c$severity, 6, '1: Site Down', 7, '2: Severe', 8, '3: Moderate', 9, '4: Minor')  The decode statement maps the numerical database values to the text strings you define within the single quotes for each item. The default return value is given if there is no comparison value provided as shown on the syntax line below. This is useful if the field is nullable since decode doesn't accept NULL as a comparison value. Syntax: decode(expression , compare_value, return_value [,compare, return_value] ... [,default_return_value] )  For additional information, refer to the 'Creating Basic Reports' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Actions to take when disabling a staff account;Answer ID 2474;When I disable a staff member, what other actions should I take?;['Answer ID 570', 'Answer ID 2260'];   Staff Accounts, All versions;"  You Â can either permanently disable a staff account or temporarily disable the account. To permanently disable a staff account, edit the staff account and select Â ""Permanently Disabled"" from the Disabled dropdown menu. Â Permanently disabling an account cannot be reversed. If an account has been permanently disabled, Â the account will Â display in reports, but the account Â cannot be re-enabled. You would need to add another account. You can temporarily disable an account a couple of ways.  Check Â the ""Account Locked"" check box. When this box is checked, the staff member cannot log in to the administration side of the application. Disable an account from Assignment by selecting the ""Disable from Assignment"" option from the Disabled dropdown menu. This option will exclude the account from being assigned to incidents and other types of records. Disable Â an Â account from Â Assignment and Reports by selecting the ""Disable from Assignment/Report filters"" option from the Disabled dropdown menu. This option will exclude an account from being assigned to incidents and other types of records and from appearing in report filters. It is also recommended to Â move disabled accounts out of chat-enabled profiles. Â This will ensure the disabled agent account will not be counted as a chat seat.  For descriptions of the checkboxes available when disabling an account, refer to Answer ID 570: Disabling Staff Accounts. When you first access the Staff Accounts table, only enabled staff accounts and temporarily disabled staff accounts are listed. To view permanently disabled staff, click the Search button on the ribbon and Â select accounts you want to view. Temporarily disabled accounts are shown in italic text and permanently disabled accounts are displayed in grey text.  When you disable a staff account, you should evaluate specific features in your site to ensure that incidents remain accessible to the enabled staff members. This includes evaluating your views and rules to ensure that incidents get reassigned accordingly.  Determine how Existing Records Should be Assigned  When disabling a staff member, determine how existing records that are assigned to them should be reassigned. This includes evaluating incidents, answers, and sales opportunities. Specifically, incidents that are assigned to a disabled staff member remain assigned to that staff member if the incident is updated by the end-user. For this reason, you should evaluate the incidents assigned to a staff member that you are disabling and reassign incident to other staff members as appropriate. For example, consider how unresolved incidents should be reassigned to other staff members prior to disabling the account. Then, search for all unresolved incidents for that staff member and assign them to another staff account or staff group. In addition, consider reassigning recently-solved incidents  Â that are assigned to Â the disabled staff member. If the customer updates an incident that was set to Waiting or Solved, the updated incident is still assigned to the now-disabled staff member. By searching for all recent incidents assigned to the staff member and assigning them to another staff account or group, updated incidents are assigned correctly. That way, if the end-user updates the solved incident, the incident will be assigned to an active staff member. Otherwise, designate a staff member to check for updated incidents assigned to a disabled staff member. You can create a custom report or view to display updated incidents that are assigned to disabled staff accounts. Similarly, you can create a report subscription or alert to notify a staff member if an incident is updated that is assigned to a disabled staff member. Another option is to set up a rule to check for incidents with a status of Updated that are assigned to the specific disabled staff members and then use the rule to re-assign the incident to another, active staff member. Similarly, evaluate answers and sales opportunities as appropriate to determine how to reassign these records to enabled staff members.  Evaluate Console Reports Â  When you disable a staff member, if the Reports box is checked, that staff member is no longer listed if the Assigned field is used as a fixed or run-time filter in a view or report. When the Report option is checked in a staff account, that name will no longer be included as a search option if you have filters in place on specific reports or views. When you permanently disable a staff account, the Reports box is checked automatically. Â  For this reason, when reassigning records to another staff member, search for the assigned Â records prior to disabling the account. For example, if a staff account has the Reports box checked, you will not be able to search Â for only the incidents that are assigned to the disabled staff member since the name is not included in the menu. Incidents assigned to the disabled staff member still appear in the view output -- as long as the records aren't filtered for another specific staff member. If you include the Assigned or Created by fields as an output column in the view, incidents assigned to the disabled staff member are listed as still belonging to that staff member, even if the staff member has been permanently disabled or has the Views/Reports box checked in their staff account. Additionally, any report schedules designated to run from the disabled account, will be updated to run from the administrator account instead.  Evaluate Rules  If you use rules to assign records directly to the staff member that you are disabling, you need to edit those rules to either remove that assignment action or edit the action to assign the records to a different staff member. For example, if you use an incident rule to assign certain incidents to the staff member you are disabling, you will first need to edit the rule so that it assigns those incidents to another staff member or remove the action that assigns the incident to the staff member. Another option would be to disable or delete the rule. Important! When evaluating and editing your rules, be sure to consider the overall strategy you have in place for handling and routing records. By editing or removing a single rule, you may end up having records meet the criteria for other existing rules in your ruleset. This could lead to records be handled or assigned to agents unexpectedly. If you try to disable the Reports option Â (enable the check box in the staff account) Â when that account is used in a rule, when you click Update, a pop-up window indicates which rules include actions associated with that staff member. If you get this pop-up when you try to disable a staff member, modify the associated rules to remove the staff member and then edit the staff account again to disable from the views and reports and lock their account.

Including a recursive drill-down in a custom report;Answer ID 2482;How can I include a recursive drill-down in my custom report?;['Answer ID 2059', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics;  When creating custom reports, if you include a hierarchical field as a column in the report, such as Product, Category, and Disposition, you can configure the report to use recursive drill-down. If Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service is enabled on your site, recursive drill-downs can be used with Outbound Email categories and Tracked Link categories. The recursive drill-down feature automatically includes links at a top level of a hierarchy so that you can drill down into the sub-levels configured for that field. You can only enable recursive drill down for a level that has a hierarchical output column. If a node has a hierarchical output column and you do not enable recursive drill-down for the node, then only data for the columnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first level will be displayed. A node can have both regular and recursive drill-down enabled, but the drill-down links cannot be the same. Nodes that have recursive drill-down enabled will have a different icon in the output level tree than non-recursive nodes. To configure recursive drill-down for a field:  In your report, Â create an output column from a hierarchical item, for example, incidents.prod_hierarchy or accounts.hierarchy. Â   Â  Click Â on the Â output column that you added. Click the Level tab on the ribbon. Click Edit located in the Current Level section of the ribbon. Â   Â  The recursive drill-down feature is automatically enabled in the Recursive Drilldown Settings section of the window. To disable the feature, clear the Enable Recursive Drilldown check box. Â   Â  In the Starting Level field, select the starting point of the hierarchy for the drill-down. For example, a starting level of 1 for products is the top products listed in the Products table. Â   Â  In the Link field, select the output column you want as the drill-down link in the report. By default, this is the hierarchical item. Â   Â  Click OK and save your report.  For additional information, refer to the 'Configure Recursive Drill-Down Levels' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Different record types such as incidents, contacts, and opportunities have different workspaces. In addition, different workspaces are used when staff multi-edit records. To see the full listing of standard workspaces, go to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces, then select the Standard folder. Standard workspace layouts are included Â for answers, incidents, contacts, organizations, tasks, opportunities, and more. These standard workspaces cannot be opened, edited or deleted. They mainly exist to be selected in staff profiles. Â  However, you can copy them and modify the copies as you wish. The workspaces used by staff members are specified in the staff profile for the account. See Answer ID 2451: Assigning workspaces to staff profiles Â for more information. You can create custom workspaces for different staff profiles. Â  This allows you to make certain fields editable in one workspace so that only specific staff members Â can access and edit those fields. Similarly, you can create workspaces so that additional tabs are available Â to some staff members but are not available to Â other staff. Note: Â The read-only, required, and hidden properties can be enabled or disabled for each profile. This means that within a single workspace, you can make a field required for some profiles and not required for others. Â  Similarly, you can make a field read-only or hidden for some profiles and not other profiles. The Hidden property is accessible when you click the Design tab at the top of the workspace designer.  For additional information, refer to the 'Workspaces' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Â To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Creating a New Workspace  To create a new workspace, you can either copy an existing workspace and modify the copy Â or you can Â create a new, blank workspace and add fields, controls and relationship items to the workspace. Note: Â  When first creating a new workspace, it is typically easier to copy a Â standard workspace and add or remove items from the copy that starting with a new, blank workspace. This allows you to become familiar with the features and configuration of the workspace based on the initial, default configuration. To copy a standard workspace, use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces. Â    In the left frame, click the Standard folder and in the right frame, right click on the workspace you want to copy and select Copy. Â    In the pop-up window, select the interface and folder of where to save the copy and Â add the name of your copied workspace. Â  Â Click OK. Â    Navigate to where you saved the copy. Â Right click on the copied workspace and select Edit or double-click on the name to open the workspace for editing. Â    Modify the workspace as you wish. Drag and drop additional fields, controls, or relationship items onto the design surface. Â   Â  Click the Insert Field or Insert Control tab to view the items that can be added to the workspace. Then, drag and drop the item into the design area.  Â  To delete items, right click on the item and select Delete. Â  Â    To view the properties of an item, click the item and then select the Design tab. Â  Select Show Details to view specifics about the item.   Click Save. Â    Update appropriate staff profiles to use the workspace.  To create a new, blank Â workspace, use the steps below: See also 'Best practices for creating workspaces'.  From the Configuration items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces. Â    Click New Workspace on the toolbar at the top. Â  Â  Â    Select the type of workspace you want to create. This Â opens Â the Workspace Editor. Â    Create the workspace you want. Using options from the Insert Field and Insert Control tabs, drag and drop tabsets, Â fields, controls, and relationship items to the design surface.  Â  Frequently, you will include a tabset in your workspace (from the Controls list) and then drag and drop specific fields or relationships items onto each tab. Â   Â  The Insert Field and Insert Control tabs list the fields and controls that can be added to the workspace. Fields available depend on the type of workspace selected. Â    Set the properties for each field and relationship item. Click on the field or item and Â set the properties for that item.   Click Save or Save and Close. In the pop-up window specify the folder and name of your new workspace. Â    Update appropriate staff profiles to use the new workspace.   Using the Workspace Designer  Workspaces consist of four primary elements: fields, controls, relationship items and the ribbon / toolbar.        Fields: pieces of information that make up a record, for example, the contact name, or incident ID are fields that can be added to a workspace. For more information on using Fields, refer to Answer ID 2466: Including Fields in a Workspace. Â            Controls: items such as title bars, tab sets or reports you can add to your workspace. In the basic mode you can add report, spacer, tab set, text, and title bar controls to the workspace. In advanced mode you can add browsers, panels, and tables. For more information on using Controls, refer to Answer ID 2457: Including Controls in a Workspace. Â  Â            Relationship Items: items relating to the record such as files, audit logs.

HTML editor hangs when copying content and saving;Answer ID 2484;Why does the HTML editor hang when saving answers?;['Answer ID 2451', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2466', 'Answer ID 2457', 'Answer ID 2469', 'Answer ID 2580', 'Answer ID 2518', 'Answer ID 5168'];   HTML Editor for Answers andÃ‚Â Documents;  When working with the HTML editor for creating answers or documents, if you have difficulty saving content that is copied and pasted from another application, check the source code of the content you are copying. While the content may display as basic text and paragraphs, several applications include considerable additional HTML code around that content. It is recommended to use Â the standard WYSIWYG HTML editor within the Oracle B2C Service application. Frequently, other applications, including Microsoft Word 2000 and higher, include custom HTML code for formatting and other span codes that are extraneous to the Ektron HTML editor. This can add several hundred lines of HTML code and several thousand characters which adversely affects performance at the Answer Console. If the content of your answer or document is large to begin with, i.e. several paragraphs and / or tables of content, the extraneous HTML code can severely interfere with the ability to save that content in the HTML editor. To avoid this condition, you can use the following options:  Paste as Text: When you copy the content, go into the answer editor and right click and choose Paste as Text. This will take out any extraneous code.  Â  Wordpad: Consider opening the document in Wordpad and then copy the content from Wordpad into the HTML editor. Copying formatted content from Wordpad instead of Word frequently includes less HTML formatting, which reduces the overall content of the answer that is being saved and viewed in the HTML editor.  Â  File Attachment or Link to Document: If the content that you want to publish or mail is lengthy itself, such as an entire chapter of a document or an entire document itself, you can include the document as a file attachment to the answer or move the document to a public web server so that you can link to that document from within the body of your answer or from the outbound email.  Â  Text Editor: You can create the initial content in a text editor such as Notepad and then copy that content into the HTML editor for your answer. Basic HTML coding such as paragraphs and line breaks are added to the underlying HTML code for that answer. You can then format the content from within the HTML editor.

Reducing the number of answers returned in a search;Answer ID 2487;How can we reduce the number of answers returned in a search?;['Answer ID 5144'];   Answer Searching;"  Within your Oracle B2C Service application, there are features that allow you to influence search results on your end-user pages so that fewer answers are returned.  Limiting Results to Less than One Page  You can modify the SEARCH_RESULT_LIMITING configuration setting to Â restrict the number of results Â returned with an initial Â search. If the initial results are not adequate, users can click the More Matches button on the page to see the full result list. The initial results are Â determined by natural breaks in the search scores for the answers returned. Â You can set the SEARCH_RESULT_LIMITING setting to one of the following values:  0 implies no limiting. Â  Â This is the default value.   1 limits the results to less than or equal to 90% of one page. That is, if you display Â 20 answers per page, when this setting is set to 1, the initial search results will be less than or equal to 18 answers.   2 limits the results to less than or equal to 50% of one page. Â    3 limits the results to less than or equal to 20% of one page. Â  Â    Configuring an AND Join Between Multiple Words  The ANS_AND_SEARCH configuration setting specifies whether multiple words in a search phrase should be joined with an AND connector (Boolean ""AND"" searches). If this setting is enabled, multiple words in a search are joined with AND. If disabled, multiple words are joined with OR. This setting affects searching on both the end-user pages and when working with answers from the administrative pages. This setting only applies to regular phrase searches and complex searches and does not affect searches using the Similar or Exact Search options. With regard to incidents, the SC_AND_SEARCH configuration setting similarly affects searching for incidents at the Support Console and on the Account - Questions Â page. If you choose to enable the ANS_AND_SEARCH or the SC_AND_SEARCH Â setting, it is much more likely that users will get zero search results if they include several words in their searches. When several words are joined with an AND connector, it is much more likely that none of your answers or incidents include all of those words.  Note: Aliasing does work when ANS_AND_SEARCH is enabled.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.   Limiting Rows Returned in Results Another option is to limit the number of rows returned within the report itself. This can be done by mondifying the Record Limit. Â See Answer ID 5144: Limiting the results of a report Â for steps on how to do this."

SPF and Sender ID considerations with Oracle B2C Service sites;Answer ID 2489;What are SPF and Sender IDÃ‚Â and how do they affect our OracleÃ‚Â ServiceÃ‚Â CloudÃ‚Â site?;['Answer ID 2701', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Sender Policy Framework (SPF);"  Sender Policy Framework (SPFv1) and Sender ID (also known as SPFv2) are two email authentication technologies that use Domain Name System (DNS) to specify which servers are allowed to send email on behalf of a particular domain name. The two technologies share common heritage and are almost identical in how they work. The main difference is how the receiver determines who (what domain) is the sender. SPFv1 uses the domain in the envelope sender address (the MAIL FROM: portion of an SMTP transaction), while Sender ID uses the Purported Responsible Address (PRA). For your Oracle B2C Service mailboxes, you will need to publish an SPF record if the domain specified in the Envelope From/Bounce Address field in the console is branded to your organization's domain. If you only edit the Friendly From/Branded Address field of the hosted mailbox, then this answer does not apply. However, if you do change the Friendly From/Branded Address field, you will need to set up DKIM. Please see Â DomainKeys and DKIM email authentication configuration. Note: If you set the configuration IFWD_UI_FROM_ADDR to 3 allowing forwards to be sent using your agent's personal email addresses, you will need to verify that the domain used by your agents email addresses also publishes the SPF record like the above scenarios.  For more information and complete procedures, see Email Management in the online documentation Â for your release. Â   How do I implement this SPF change?  The following example shows what you should publish in your SPF record. This example applies to Service Â email Â as well as Outreach and Feedback email. Example: As the director of customer service Â for Widgets R Us, you want to Â send email from your hosted Oracle B2C Service Â site to your customers, Â and you want to brand your email so that your customers see ""offers@widgetsrus.com"" in the email's From address. Action: Â Define SPF records in the widgetsrus.com DNS as follows: widgetsrus.com IN TXT ""v=spf1 include:rnmk.com ~all"" Note: You must add your own domain in your SPF record (e.g. Â widgetsrus.com Â as seen above) In this example, hosts identified in the rnmk.com SPF record are allowed to send on behalf of widgetsrus.com. The final entry, ""~all"" defines the policy that Â will be used. Â In this case, all email originating from hosts listed in the rnmk.com SPF record that use the domain in the example will be accepted as legitimate sources of email for widgetsrus.com. If the receiver identifies email coming from a host that is not listed in the SPF record, the receiver should soft fail those emails.   Full Specifications For more information on SPF, Â see http://www.openspf.org/ and http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4408.txt For more information on Sender ID, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/antispam-and-antimalware/antispam-protection/sender-id?view=exchserver-2019"

Using the audit log;Answer ID 2490;What is the audit log?;['Answer ID 1873', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Viewing the Audit Log for various record types;"  When looking at a record in your Oracle B2C Service application, the audit log lists a series of actions or transactions Â that have affected that record, including when the record was created, events that occurred related to the record (such as editing or changing the status of an incident), and by whom. Items are listed in reverse chronological order.  Record types that have Audit Logs  The Â default workspaces include a tab for the audit log. Custom workspaces may have the audit log embedded on another tab or removed from the workspace for some reason. If you do not have an Audit Log tab for the record types below, contact the Oracle B2C Service administrator for your site to determine how to access the audit log. Audit logs are associated with the types of records listed below.  Incidents Answers Contacts Organizations Opportunities Tasks Campaigns Surveys Mailings Audiences (segments and contact lists) Documents  Â   Additional Considerations  Viewing the entire audit log: Â The inclusion of audit logs is controlled by the workspace used by the staff member. Â  The default workspaces include a tab for the audit log. When viewing an audit log, staff can use the Options menu to print, sort, and export the content of the audit log. This is particularly useful if there are a large number of entries in the log. Rule actions: Â If a rule acts on a record, the action is included in the audit log, but the name of the rule is not. To determine which rule or rules act on an incident, you must use the Rule Log. For more information on the Rule Log, refer to Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log to troubleshoot rules.  Deleted staff accounts: The audit log uses the transactions table along with the current staff accounts and contacts tables to determine actions that have affected the record. If you delete a staff account from your application, the action is still part of the transactions table, but the staff name is no longer accessible from the accounts table. As a result, the audit log can no longer display the name of the staff member who performed the action (since it no longer exists in the database). Â  Instead the audit log attributes the action to a ""deleted or unset value"". (In older versions, ""No Value"" or ""Deleted Staff Account"" may be seen in the audit log of a record.)  Â  Customizing the audit log: Â  Staff Â have some ability to customize the layout of the contents of the audit log. From the Options menu, staff can sort and slice the rows as with any report. The Field Chooser option allows staff to modify the order of the columns and even remove columns. In addition, the user can right click on a column to edit the format, sort the records or hide the column.

Some top-level values do not show in a drill-down;Answer ID 2491;With some drill-down reports, why are some of the top-level valuesÃ‚Â not listed within the top level?;['Answer ID 1873', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Analytics, All versions;" Values missing from top level: When using multiple levels for drill-down reporting, a value at the top level will only display if there are drill-down records for that parent value. For example, if you have a Â report that lists unresolved incidents for each queue, the queues that have unresolved incidents will be listed at the highest level. Then, Â when you drill down, you can see the list of individual incidents. In this case, if a queue does not have unresolved incidents, it will not be listed in the top level of the Â report since there is nothing to drill down to. Records not assigned to any value: If there are records at the drill down level that are not assigned any value in the top level, there will be an additional Â top level listed as ""No Value"". For example, in a Â report that displays unresolved incidents by queue, if there are several incidents that are not assigned to a queue, at the top level of the report, there will be a row that states, ""No Value"" and the count of incidents is listed. You can drill down on the No Value option to see the specific incidents that are not assigned to a queue."

Configuring Search Priority Words and Recommended Links;Answer ID 2492;How do I add items to the Recommended Links section on the answers page?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Search Priority Words;"  Search Priority Words Â allow you to fix an answer or other Web page to the search results of a specific word. You can also flag a record to always display with any search that is performed. Search Priority Words can be associated with either a specific published answer or to a separate Web page or document. Â  Priority words are interface-specific. Â  Â The priority word will display on the same interface in which it was created. Â  Â For example, if a priority word should display on interface B, one must login to interface B before creating the priority word, or access interface B's Admin Console via the Links menu. On the end-user pages, the answer or document specified in a priority word are returned in a separate section named Recommended Links. If you wish to have two answers or documents returned with the same search term, you can create multiple Priority words that share the same keyword(s). Multiple priority words are displayed in the order that they are entered into the table. Using Search Priority Words effectively There is no limit to the number of priority words that can be employed; however, Â an excessive number will cause search performance degradation. Â  Â  Multiple search words can be associated within a single Ã¢â‚¬Å“priority wordÃ¢â‚¬Â group. Â  Â Again, Â search performance may be affected as the number of search words increases. To configure search priority words in your interface, use the steps below:  Go to Â Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Knowledge Base &gt; Search Priority Words. Complete the fields listed below:  Search Priority Word Name: This field is the name of the keyword or group of keywords that will return the answer or document specified. This is not the word that is searched on to return the document of interest. If an end-user enters the Name field value as a search term, the associated answer or document will not be returned unless you have also entered the same data in the Keywords field.  Keywords: Similar to keywords in an answer, enter search words or phrases in this field. Use a comma or semicolon to separate words and phrases, or enter each word or phrase on a separate line. You can enter up to 125 characters per search term. After saving your priority words, each word or phrase appears on a new line the next time you edit priority words.  When end-users enter any of these terms, the answer or document will be returned. The end-user must enter the exact phrase as a search term to have the answer or document returned.  For example, if you include a multi-word phrase such as ""user conference"", the end-user must search on that phrase in order for the priority word to be returned. If you are working with phrases, you should consider including the single words -- in this case, ""user"" and ""conference"" -- so that the document will be returned if the user searches on any of words included in the phrase. You could enter the following in the Keywords field: user conference user conference  This would return the priority word if the end-user searches on a single word or some similar phrase that includes one of the words such as ""customer conference"" or ""user forum"". Â   Â  Disabled: You can check this box to make the priority word ineffective. That is, the answer or document will not be returned with the search results based on the priority word configuration. An answer may still be returned with search results if it contains the word used in the search or has that word listed as a keyword in the answer.  Always Show: Check this box if you want the priority word Â to display for all searches performed from the Answers page. The priority word will display even if the search term does not match any of the keywords or phrases for that priority word. If unchecked, the priority word will display only when a search is performed that includes a word or phrase entered in the Keywords field.  Type: Specify whether the priority word is to be associated with a published answer or another Web-accessible document from a URL.  Answer ID: If the type is set to Public Answer, enter the answer ID to associate.  Title: If the type is set to WWW Document, enter the title to use for the link.  URL: If the type is WWW Document, enter the URL of the document to link to.  Text: This field is optional and allows you to provide a brief description of the answer or document if you want to include more information that just the Summary of the answer or the Title field. Â    Click Save. Â   Â  In sites utilitizing Customer Portal 3.3.X or later you must ensure that the Answer Results page includes the TopicWords widget.  Â This is not included on the page by default but it can be added with the following widget declaration: &lt;rn:widget path=""knowledgebase/TopicWords"" /&gt;  Â  Go to your end-user pages and search on the priority word you configured. Verify that the answer or document displays in the Recommended Links section.

Viewing ID values of various fields and records;Answer ID 2493;How can I determine the database ID values of various fields andÃ‚Â records? Can I add the field ID as an output column in a report?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Explorers;"  There are a variety of ways to view the database ID value for fields and records. In most cases, go to the area where you would edit the field. You can typically place the mouse directly over the value of interest and a small pop-up will appear that indicates the ID for that field. You can use this feature with system fields such as profiles, groups, staff accounts, countries, products, categories, dispositions, incidents, answers, statuses, access level and custom fields. For example, to determine the database ID for a specific staff profile, go to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles. Â  Â Then, in the list of profiles, hover over the specific profile you are interested in and the ID value displays in a pop-up. Note: The contents of the Notes field also displays when you hover over the field name. This allows you to more easily review internal notes for each field. Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  Â  Â Data Dictionary (i.e. field IDs) While editing a report, example: status 1. If it's not already visible, open the Data Dictionary (click the Data Dictionary button on the Home ribbon) 2. In the left pane, select the table you are interested in (i.e. incidents) 3. In the right pane, on the field that you would like to see the IDs for, right-click and select View Data Definition That will open a window that shows all the IDs for the selected field. The Data Dictionary may also be available from the Navigation area: Configuration &gt; Database &gt; Data Dictionary   Â By Creating a Custom Report (i.e. adding ID output column)  If you would like to make the data IDs available to people that don't have access to the report editor, it is possible to obtain database IDs for certain custom menu items by creating a simple custom report. Â  Â To do so, follow the steps below:  1. Â Create a new custom report 2. Output the field in question as a column (e.g., incidents.status_id) 3. Â Output the same field as a column again, but with "".id"" appended to the field name (e.g., incidents.status_id.id) 4. Â Save and generate the report  This should provide something similar to the following, for example:      STATUS ID NAME  STATUS ID #       Pending      4         Review      28         Development      7         Legal      124      ...and so forth. The database values are helpful to know when using particular fields in reports. Â  Â For example, a report may use the transactions table joined to the incidents table to report on incidents that have undergone a status change transaction (transactions.trans_type = 6). Â  Â The ""transactions.id1"" field can be output in the report, which will display the status ID number of the status the incident was changed to, not the status ID name. Â  Â Therefore, it is helpful to have the corresponding status ID numbers available to interpret this information.  Â  Â Feature Explorer windows (i.e. reports, mailings, navigation sets, workspaces, etc.) Â   You can add the ID column to any explorer window using the Choose Details... button. This allows you to easily determine the ID for the feature listed in the explorer.  1. Open the explorer associated with reports, navigation sets or workspaces. 2. In the top portion of the explorer, click Choose Details... 3. Â Click the ID checkbox and click OK.  When the pop-up window closes, the explorer window will refresh and the ID column will now be visible."

Creating rules for transactional surveys;Answer ID 2495;How can IÃ‚Â create rules for transactional survey?;['Answer ID 2506', 'Answer ID 2386', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Surveys, Feedback;" After creating Â a transactional survey, you must Â also create or update a rule to trigger the survey to be sent to Â the contact. The survey can be sent based on updates to contact records, incident updates, or opportunity updates. The rule must be added to the appropriate ruleset so that an update to that record type will send the survey. For more information on creating transactional surveys, refer to Answer ID 2506: Configuring Transactional Surveys. Within a rule, the Send Transactional Survey action Â can be added to either the Â THEN or ELSE part of the rule. To add the Send Transactional Survey action, use the appropriate path below: In Â incident or opportunity rules, click Add Action &gt; Email &gt; Send Transactional Survey.  Â  In contact rules, Â click Add Action &gt; Send Transactional Survey.  Functions: Â  If you have several transactional surveys, consider placing the Â survey rules in a function so that you can call the function to evaluate your group of rules to determine which survey should be sent. Launched surveys: Â The survey must be in Launched state for rule to Â actually send the survey. The application allows you to configure a rule and select a survey in the draft state as part of the rule. Â  However, before the survey can be sent as part of a rule action, you must launch the survey. To launch the survey, use the steps below: From the Surveys Explorer, open the survey for editing.  Â  Click the Delivery tab and click the Launch button.  Â  Close the survey. Â  You do not need to save the survey before closing the tab.  Example for sending a closed-incident survey: Â To create a rule to send a closed-incident survey, use the steps below. Â  Since the survey is sent based on a change to an incident, you must configure an incident rule to send the survey. From the Service Administration Items Â &gt; Rules &gt; Incident &gt; Edit Incident Rules. Â   Â  Within the appropriate rule state or function, create a rule that includes the Send Transactional Survey Â action. Â  Â   Â  For example, the rule might read:  Â  IF Incident.Status equals Solved AND Incidents.Previous Status not Â equals Solved  Â  THEN Send Transactional Survey (select survey by name from the menu) Â after X minutes Note: this action includes an option to delay the sending of the survey hours or days later. Â  Â   Â  Â  Â  Save the rule and activate the ruleset.  Â  Create a test incident and save it so that it will trigger the rule. NOTE: Once a survey is sent for a solved incident, it cannot be sent a second time for the same incident. You can workaround this by sending a secondary survey for the same incident Â if needed. Viewing Results: Â Once the survey is launched, Â rules are activated and a Â test incident is done, you can go to the Results tab of the survey to view various results reports. Â  For more information, refer to Answer ID 2386: Viewing survey results Â or see the 'Viewing survey results' section in online documentation for your versions. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Â  Transactional surveys can be sent as part of a campaign or can be sent as an action included in a contact, incident, or opportunity rule. Â When included in the THEN section of a rule, when Â a record is updated and matches the IF criteria of the rule, the survey is sent to the contact associated to that Â incident or opportunity. You can also include the action to send a survey as part of the ELSE clause of a rule. The most common application for transactional surveys is to send a survey to a contact Â after a service incident closes (also called a closed-incident survey). Â  This allows you to obtain customer satisfaction ratings associated with the customer service experience provided to your end-users. For Â comprehensive information on Â survey settings and features, Â refer to the Â 'Outreach and Feedback' chapter in online documentation Â for your specific release. Â To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Creating a New Transactional Survey  In order to create transactional surveys, the navigation set specified in your staff profile must Â have the Surveys button included. This allows you to access the Surveys and Questions explorers. In addition, your staff profile must have features enabled on the Â Feedback tab to allow you to perform create surveys and add or create questions. If your profile allows you to create questions and survey, use the steps below to create a transactional survey:  Click New &gt; Survey from the RightNow Console toolbar. Â  Â You can also Â click the Surveys navigation button on the left and Â click the Survey Explorer. Then select New from the Surveys Explorer. Â  Â    Select Â Transactional Survey. Â  Â    On the Summary tab, assign the survey to the appropriate staff member. Â   You can allow customers to anonymously take the survey, by checking the Allow Anonymous box. However with a Closed Incident Survey, this is not recommended as you Â may want to be able to contact customers who are not satisfied. Â  Â    Click the Â Questionnaire tab to design your survey.  Note: To create a template for your survey, select New &gt; Content Library &gt; Template. Â After saving the template, you can use it for your survey by clicking Pick Â a Template Â from the Tasks box. Â    Add questions to your survey. Click Add a Question to select from already-saved questions or to create a new question for your survey.   The audience for the survey is defined to include all contacts who trigger the survey to be sent. You can, however, exclude contacts from receiving the survey.  On Â the Audience tab, Â evaluate the Options listed. By default, the survey is configured to honor the global opt-in list and to honor the external suppression list so that surveys are sent only to contacts who have not opted out from receiving surveys. Â    If you have a custom opt-in field that users can select to Â opt out of specific types of surveys, define a segment Â based on the custom opt-in field that allows them to opt out of closed-incident surveys. Then, add that segment to Â the Excluded section of the Audiences Â tab. Â This allows you to exclude contacts who have opted out of receiving this specific type of survey by clicking an option associated to a custom opt-in field.  Â  Â  From the Invitation Message tab, create the email that will be sent to customers. Â  When creating the message, the application defaults to include a link to the survey. Â To modify the text and format of the link, double click and enter your changes in the pop-up window.  Be Â sure that Â the invitation email includes a link to your survey. Â  Â In addition, be sure that the survey includes appropriate opt-out links.   Save the survey. In the pop-up window, select the location and Â name your survey.   Proof the survey by sending it to a list of reviewers. From the Proofing tab, click Send Proof Message to define the proof Â recipients and Â specific message to them. Â This will allow members of your organization to review the Survey layout and either approve or suggest improvements. Â  Â No statistics will be collected from your reviewers which might otherwise skew reporting once you have launched the survey. Â Please note that survey results for Surveys/Mailings filled out in proof mode will be available for 7 days, after which will be purged from the question_sessions table by the agedatabase utility. The 7 days setting is not configurable. Â  Â Proofing is intended to quickly show a proof of your survey to approving members of your team.   Â  Note: Â If you did not save the survey Â already, you must save the survey before the proof can be sent.  Â  Â  When you are satisfied with the survey and proof results, launch your survey. Â  From the Delivery tab, click the Launch button and confirm the launch.  Note: To maintain the integrity of the survey and its results, it is recommended that you not make any changes to it, once your survey has been launched. Important Next Steps! Â  At this point, you have created the survey to be used, but it does not yet have a means to actually be sent. You must either include the survey as part of a campaign or you must configure a rule that defines the criteria as to when it will be sent. To have the survey sent based on Â a rule, you must Â create and activate appropriate contact, opportunity, or incident rules to trigger the survey. Â The survey must be in a launched state in order for the rule to send it. Â  For more information on using rules with your survey, refer to Â  Answer ID 2495: Creating Rules for Transactional Surveys. "

Cannot access navigation buttons for our new Oracle B2C Service module;Answer ID 2507;Why don't we see any of the newly enabled Feedback module buttons on the Oracle B2C Service Console?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2495'];   For sites where a new module has only recently beenÃ‚Â enabled (i.e. Outreach, Feedback, Chat, etc.)  Issue   We just had Feedback enabled on our site.Ã‚Â  When we log in, though, we don't see any of the Feedback buttons on the Oracle B2C Service Console.;  When a new module is enabled for your site by enabling the appropriate configuration setting, that module is not automatically added to be included or enabled in navigation sets or Â staff profiles. As a result, when the module is enabled, you do not automatically see the new features for that module added to the Â Oracle B2C Service Console. This applies to enabling the following modules:  Service Outlook Â  Opportunities Â  Chat Feedback Outlook Integration Disconnected Access  Therefore, after the configuration setting for the module has been enabled, you still need to review and update the appropriate navigation sets and profiles. Â  For example, if your site recently had Â Outreach enabled, once the MOD_MA_ENABLED setting is enabled for your site, you need to create at least one navigation set that allows access to the Outreach navigation buttons and also add or update at least one staff profile to allow staff the ability to add and edit Outreach documents, templates, mailings and campaigns. Similarly, if your site recently had Â Opportunities enabled, you still need to add or edit a navigation set to allow access to the Opportunities navigation button and then add or edit a profile to allow the ability to create opportunities and send quotes.  After a module has been enabled for your site, you still must do the following: Step 1: Â  Add or edit a navigation set to include the navigation buttons for module that was just enabled. If you are editing an existing navigation set, open the set for editing and then click the down arrow at the bottom of the left frame and select Add or Remove Buttons. From there you can enable the new navigation buttons associated with the newly-enabled module. If you create a new navigation set, all of the buttons are visible by default, including the Â buttons associated with the newly-enabled module. Â  From there, you can remove certain buttons from being available in the navigation set by clicking the down arrowhead in the left frame and selecting Add or Remove Buttons.  Step 2: Â  Then, add or edit a staff profile to use the new or updated navigation set. Â  Â  If you updated an existing navigation set, the navigation set does not need to be modified in the profile. Â  If you created a new navigation set, you must either edit the existing profile or create a new one that calls out the new navigation set on the Common tab. Step 3: Â  In the staff profile, you must also enable appropriate features for the newly-enabled module. Â  Â  In the Â staff profile, Â click the tab associated with the new module, i.e. the Â Outlook, Opportunities, or Feedback Â tab, Â and enable appropriate boxes to enable the ability to perform the necessary functions associated with that module. For example, on the Â Outlook tab, you can enable the ability to create documents, templates, Â mailings, and campaigns. Â  Â  Oracle Service Chat features Â display on the Service tab in the profile. Â  Outlook Integration and Disconnected Access features display on the Sales tab in the profile. Step 4: Â  If you added a new profile for the new module features, edit the appropriate Â staff account(s) to Â  Â use the new profile. Â  When the staff member logs in the next time, the additional buttons are available to them -- even if the Â Customize Navigation Set checkbox Â is enabled in the profile.

Allowing staff to customize their navigation sets;Answer ID 2508;How can I allowÃ‚Â staff membersÃ‚Â to customize their own navigation set?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2495'];   Navigation Sets;"  Navigation sets define the buttons and reports listed in the left frame of the Â Oracle B2C Service console when a staff member logs in. Navigation sets allow Â access to different Â features, reports, and records Â within the application. Navigation sets are assigned to staff members from the Interfaces Â section Â of their staff profile. Therefore, you can create different navigation Â set for different profiles in your application. This allows you to customize which buttons and reports are accessible to staff when they log in. If you do not create navigation sets and assign them to profiles, staff members will not have access to navigation buttons and lists. For example, the navigation set used for your marketing staff could include the navigation buttons for campaigns, mailings, content library, and audiences, while your support staff would not have these buttons included in their support navigation set. Note: Â  From the Oracle B2C Service console, all staff can reorder the buttons or disable buttons from the navigation set specified in their profile by selecting the Â Oracle Icon in the top left corner &gt; Â  Options &gt; Navigation Pane.  Allowing Staff to Customize their Navigation Â Lists  Staff can only customize the report lists for each button if the Customize Navigation Set button is enabled in their staff profile. If this box is disabled (clear), then the staff member cannot add or remove reports listed for each navigation button. To change the Customize Navigation Set feature in a staff profile, use the steps below:  From Configuration item, select Staff Management &gt; Profiles.   Right click on the profile you want to change and select Open.   Check the Customize Navigation Set check box.   Click Save.  When the Customize Navigation Set box is enabled, all staff accounts assigned to the profile are able to customize the navigation lists for each of the navigation buttons in their navigation set. After the profile has been edited, the agent must log out and log back in for these changes to take effect. Important! Â Remember that editing a navigation set used in a profile does not impact staff members who have permission to customize their navigation sets. Staff members should know that they may not be able to access some Â specific records Â if their Â workspace layout or profile Â prevents them from doing so. Once staff members are given access to change their navigation lists, they can use the steps in the following section to make changes.  Changing the Navigation List  Only staff whose profile has the Customize Navigation Set checkbox enabled can customize the list of reports for each navigation button.  Click the Customize List link in the section you want to change. The Customize List window will open.   Select the report from the left frame and click Add. To remove an report from the list, highlight it in the right Â frame and click Remove.  You can search for a specific report. Click the Find in List link above the Available Items field or press CTRL+F. Then enter your search term to find the report of interest. Click OK to save. Changes take effect immediately.  Changing the Order of the Navigation Buttons  All staff can change the order of the navigation buttons or disable buttons that are included in their navigation set.  From the Oracle Â RightNow Console, all staff can select the Â Oracle Icon in the top left corner &gt; Options &gt; Navigation Pane.   Check or uncheck the options you want to see in the Navigation buttons list.   Change the order of the buttons by highlighting a button and selecting Move Up or Move Down.   Click OK. The changes take effect immediately.  Changing the Navigation Item that Opens at Startup  All staff can customize whether a report opens automatically when you login, regardless of whether the staff profile has the Customize Navigation Set button enabled. Â  From the Oracle Â RightNow Console, all staff can select the Â Oracle Icon in the top left corner &gt; Options &gt; Navigation Pane. From the Behavior section, select from the following options:  Nothing Default navigation item for current page Last navigation item opened in previous session  Note: Whatever is set in the agent's profile is the navigation set used when the staff member logs in. Then, if the agent has customized his navigation list, that is the navigation set Â used."

Creating a basic custom report;Answer ID 2509;How do I create a custom report?;['Answer ID 1041', 'Answer ID 1884'];   All Versions, Analytics;"  This answer addresses steps for creating a simple report Â that displays data without grouping or drill-down levels. Â  Reports are interface specific. If you add a new report while logged in to an interface, you can only access that report from that same interface. Â  When you copy a report, you can save the copy to a different interface. In order to edit the copied report, though, you must access it from the console for the interface the copy is saved to. Copying Â reports: All releases come with many standard reports. Â  To copy a standard report, Â right-click on the report in the Reports Explorer and select Copy. If you Â have created a custom report that is close to the report you would like, you can copy that report to provide a solid starting point for your new report. Report Builder: Creating a basic custom report is all done from within the Report Builder. You can customize reports based on your organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needs using the Report Design Center Ribbon, Â Data Dictionary, and Design Surface.        Ribbon: Â The report design centerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ribbon includes eight tabs from which you can access options to create or edit a report. The tabs on the ribbon change depending on which view you use and what is selected on the design surface. Â                   Data Dictionary: Lists the available database Â tables and fields Â that you can use in custom reports. Â            Design Surface: this is where you design the Â report layout, including Â output columns, headings, and charts.      Overview for Adding a New Report The high-level steps in creating a new report are listed below.  Add the new report. Define filters and search criteria for the report. Select the output columns and layout of your report. Determine who can run and/or edit your report. Save your report. Â  Â   Each of these steps is described in more detail below.   Step 1: Add a New Report When adding a new report, you must Â select which type of report to add: grid, standard, or standard with chart. Â  Grid reports are most commonly used for use within the console to list multiple records which can then be opened for editing. Â  After selecting the report type, the Report Builder opens to allow you to define your report. To add a new report:  Click the Â ""File"" button in the upper left of console, select Â Report Â   OR  You can also add a new report from the Reports Explorer, using the steps below:   Click the Analytics button on the navigation pane. Double-click Reports to open the Reports Explorer. Click New Report on the ribbon Choose the type of report you want to build; a Grid report, a Standard report, or a Standard report with Chart.    Step 2: Define the Search Criteria (Filters) Used for the Report Filters are used to restrict and define Â which records should be returned in your report. This allows you to run a report that returns a manageable amount of data or return records that are of specific interest to Â your business operations.  Â If the record matches your filter definitions, then that record is included in the report. For example, a Support manager is interested in reviewing unresolved incidents assigned to her group. Two report filters to define are:  Incident status type equal Unresolved Incident Assigned Group equals Support  When configuring a filter, you must include a database field, an operator, and a value or values of interest.  Filter types: When setting up a report, you can set two types of filters: fixed and run-time selectable filters.        Fixed filters Â are set at the time the report is configured and cannot be changed when the report is run. Â            Run-time selectable filters Â can be changed each time the report is run. When configuring the report, you specify the default value(s) to use, but when you actually run the report, you can change the value for that search criteria.     For example, you can configure a report that lists all of your public answers. Then you decide that you would like Â a report to list all of your proposed answer. Instead of copying the report, you can simply include the Â Answer Status Â field as a run-time selectable filter in your existing report. That way, when you run the report, you can Â select the specific status Â to use for the report output. This allows you to have one report to maintain, but you have the added flexibility of generating the report based on values you specify at the time the report is run.  Adding filters to your report: Â   From Â the Home tab, click Add Filter. Â  Or click the Filters button and from the pop-up window, click Add Filter.   In the pop-up window, enter the following information:  Name: (optional) displays under the Filters icon. If this is left blank, the Expression is used in the Filters section.  Type: Enable the top check box to set the filter as a run-time filter and if you wish, enter custom text to use as the label for that filter when the user performs the search. Â  Also, enable the Required check box if the user must select a field when performing a search.  Definition: Â  Right click in the Expression field to select the database table and field to use for your filter. Or if you know the name, simply type in the table name and field in the format table_name.field_name. As you type, you can select from the matching tables and fields. For example, type ""in"" and you will be able to select the incidents table.  Next, select the operator. The operator options change depending on the type of field you select. For example, date fields Â include a ""between"" Â operator to configure a date range. Menu fields include the ""in list"" and ""not in list"" operators to select multiple menu items.  Finally, enter the value used for comparison, such as the date range of interest or the status of interest.   Click OK. The window closes and your filter displays under the Filters icon in your Report Outline.   If you have multiple filters, by default, the logical expression joins the filters using an AND connector. i.e. filter 1 AND filter 2 AND filter 3. If you need to modify the logical expression, right click on the Filters icon and select Edit Logical Expression. For more information on using logical expressions, refer to Answer ID 1041: Using Logical Expressions.   Step 3: Define the Report Output and Format   In a basic report, each record is displayed as a row in your report. You define the columns of the report by dragging and dropping database fields onto the design surface. Â You can also right-click in the design surface and select Add Column. The Data Dictionary section allows you to easily select fields to include in your report. Â  The options below are available when working with the Data Dictionary. Â  To Â view a description of a table, right click on it and choose View Data Definition.        Customize: Â  To the right of the Data Dictionary heading, the Customize Â link allows you to narrow the list of tables by enabling specific types of tables. For example to easily review tables associated with your Service module, click Customize and deselect everything except Service and click OK. Â  Now when you select All Tables, you only see the database tables associated with Service (including incident and answer-related tables).           Current Dataset: Â  This option displays all of the tables that are currently used in your report. Â  The tables you used in defining your filters are listed. As you add output columns to your report, additional tables may be added to the current dataset if you include fields from other tables.          Â   All Tables: Â  This option allows you to select from the entire list of Common, Service, Outreach, Â Opportunity, and Feedback Â database tables (as determined by which modules are enabled in your application. Â           Â   Functions: Â  When creating more advanced reports, the functions allow you to summarize a column of data. For more information on functions, refer to Answer ID 1884: Functions Used in Reports.      When you click on a table name, the fields for that table display alphabetically in the Fields section. Drag the fields for your report Â to the design area. Â  You can reorder your columns by dragging and dropping the fields relative to one another. You can also reorder your columns by right-clicking on the column Â and selecting Â Move Column Right or Move Column Left. Â   Editing options: You can further format each column by right clicking the column and selecting from the edit options below:       Â   Edit Definition: Â Allows you to customize the column heading, add a description of the field, or select a different field for that column.          Â   Edit Formatting: Â Allows you to customize the layout of the contents in that column including numerical displays, column width, text alignment, and font style. Â  Specific formatting features depend on the type of field displayed. Â  That is, formatting options differ for date fields than for text fields.          Â   Edit Calculations: Â Allows you to add summary information at the bottom of Â each column, such as a maximum, minimum, average, or total.     Sorting the output: Â  If you are only using one field to sort the records in your report, you can right click on that output column and select either Sort Ascending or Sort Descending. Â  For example, in a list of answers, you could sort by the Answer ID field. Simply, right click on the Answer ID column and select Sort Ascending. You can define up to four levels of sorting for your report.  From the Home tab, click the Sort button. Â   Â  Â  Â   In the pop-up window define the primary, secondary and additional sort criteria and indicate whether the sort is to be ascending or descending for each level.   Step 4: Define Who Can Use and Edit the Report You can grant permission based on staff profiles to allow other staff members the ability to either run and/or edit your report. In order for other staff to be able to access the report, you must save the report in a Public Reports Â folder. Â Reports saved in the My Reports folders are only accessible to the staff member who created and saved the report. Staff members whose profiles have the Analytics - Administer permissions enabled are automatically granted permission to Â open and edit all reports saved in the public folders. To grant access for other staff to run or edit your report, use the steps below:  From the Home tab, click the Permissions button. Determine which profiles should have access to Â run your report Â and enable the Â check box in the Â Open column.   Determine which profiles should be able to edit the view and enable the appropriate check boxes in the Edit column.   Step 5: Save and Run Your Report To save your custom report: Â   Click the Save icon in the upper-left corner of your design surface and select Save, Save As, or Save and Close. For new reports, the Save and Save As options are identical.   In the pop-up window, highlight the appropriate Â folder (which fills out the Â Folder field) and Â  enter the name of the report in the Â Name field.   Click OK. If you created your report from the Reports Explorer, your report will be listed in the appropriate folder.  To generate your report: You can open the report from the Reports Explorer.  Click the Analytics button in your navigation pane and double click Reports Explorer.   In the right pane, navigate to the folder containing your report.   Either double-click on the report or right click and select Open.   For further information, refer to the online documentation for Overview of Custom Reports Â and the Creating a Custom Report video."

Using slicing and rollups with reports;Answer ID 2511;What is the difference between rollups and slices?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Formatting Results;  When generating a report, you can use slicing and rollups to view specific subsets of data based on an output column in the report.  Slices: Including slices in Â a report allows you to Â view all of the Â data or Â just a portion of the data that you want to view. For example, you have a report that shows all incidents by agents. You can slice the report to show data assigned to specific agents. You can then click on the agent's name to view only those Â incidents assigned to that agent. When adding slices to a report, you can have the slices listed to the left of the report in a tree structure or you can have the slices listed across the top of the report as links. You can edit the report to include slicing so that when you run the report, the slices are generated. You can also Â  include slices to a report after it has been generated. To add Â slices to Â a report, use the steps below:  Either open the report for editing or run the report of interest.   From the Home tab, click Slice from the Analyze group. Â  Â  Â  Â    Enter the criteria you want to slice by in the fields provided. Â   Â  For example, you can slice by column values and then specify whether to display the slices as a tree or as links. Then, specify the column or columns to slice by.   Click OK to save the slice settings.   If editing a report, save the report.  Rollups: Â Rollups allow you to collapse (or rollup) a section of Â data within your report based on a column value. This allows you to expand and view a specific section of your report Â at a time. Â  With a rollup, you can have a section of Â data and either expand it to show all Â records associated with the value Â or you can collapse that section. For example, you can display incidents for a group and use a rollup on the status to easily access all incidents associated with that status. Then, you can expand the Unresolved incidents to see which new incidents were submitted or you can expand the Updated incidents to see which incidents had been updated by the end-user. When rollups are used, each grouping displays a sub-total of the number of records in that group so that you can easily see which rollup has the most records associated with it. You can edit a report and add a rollup so that the rollup is included automatically when the report is run. You can also add a rollup to a report after it has been run to allow you to easily group records based on a column value. To create a rollup, use the steps below:  Open the report for editing or run the report.   From the Home tab, click Rollups from the Analyze group. Â  Â    In the pop-up window, select the column and sort order for the rollup groups.   To include groups counts for the rollup values, scroll to the bottom of the Â pop-up window and enable the Display Group Counts check box.   Click OK to close the pop-up window.   If you edited a report, save the report and generate it to review the rollup groups.  Whether to use slices or rollups depends on your preference for how to access and review the data. Consider running a report that you are familiar with and then add slices and rollups to that report to determine which options works best for you and your staff.  For additional information, refer to the 'Slicing report data' and 'Define rollups' Â section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Determining Tag, Quarantine, and Block Scores in Barracuda;Answer ID 2512;How can I determine the best scores to use for the tag, quarantine and block thresholds for the Barracuda filtering?;['Answer ID 1595', 'Answer ID 9764'];   Incoming Email, Barracuda;"  The Spam filters that Â Oracle implements are Barracuda Networks appliances. The method that Barracuda Networks uses to rate Spam uses a point system. Spam messages generally have certain attributes that help to identify them as Spam. Each of these attributes is assigned a point value and the points for all of the applicable attributes for each email are added together to arrive at the final Spam score. It is this Spam score that is compared to the three scores listed on the Preferences &gt; Spam Settings page to determine how the message should be treated -- whether it should be blocked or quarantined.  Default Scoring for Email (as set by Oracle's Hosting group):  The recommended scores that display on the Preferences &gt; Spam Settings page are recommendations written into the Barracuda page itself. However, Oracle's Hosting team has set the default scores to be different than the values recommended on the page. This is because we recommend that the blocking feature be set higher initially. The email blocking feature is disabled by setting the Block Score to a value of 10. With blocking disabled, you can be sure that emails are not being blocked and your legitimate customer requests are delivered to the mailbox. The default value for this setting is 9. Note: Even with blocking disabled in Barracuda, email messages may be discarded based on the mailbox configuration or your rule configuration within the Â Oracle B2C Service Â application itself. By default, the quarantine feature is disabled as configured on the Preferences &gt; Quarantine Settings page. This ensures that email messages are delivered to your hosted mailbox and are processed to become incidents based on your mailbox settings within your Â Oracle B2C Service Â application. Oracle's default score are set with a Tag score of 3.5 and a Quarantine score of 10 (disabled). Email messages with a score that exceeds the Quarantine Score will have #QUAR# pre-pended to the Subject line of the incident. Email messages with a score between the Tag Score and Quarantine Score result in incidents with #TAG# pre-pended to the Subject line. The default scoring as configured Â in Oracle is: Tag Score: 3.5 Quarantine Score: 10.0 (disabled) Block Score: 9.0  Score Descriptions  Tag Score: If a message has a spam score above the tag value (3.5 by default), the text ""#TAG#"" is added in the subject line. This is then passed on to your techmail mailbox, and incidents created from these messages will have #TAG# in the subject field. This is used to flag messages as potential SPAM. Within your workflow rules, you can add a rule to route the messages with #TAG# in the subject differently than other incidents. Quarantine Score: If a message has a cumulative score above the set value the Barracuda appliance will put #QUAR# in the subject. If you have the Quarantine feature enabled, the Barracuda will keep the message in quarantine, and the message will not be delivered to your techmail mailbox. When you first log in to the Barracuda, the first screen you see shows the messages that are quarantined. From this screen, you can delete or deliver the messages that are held in the quarantine. Block Score: If this is set to a value other than 10, any message with a spam score greater than the block score is not delivered or quarantined. It is instead deleted. You will not see the message in your Support Console and the message will not be visible via the quarantine on the Barracuda. Effectively this message will become permanently lost. Note: If the block score is lower than the quarantine score, blocking takes precedence and the message is blocked (as opposed to being flagged as quarantined). Similarly, if the quarantine score is less than the tagging score, the quarantine score takes precedence. In this case, no messages will ever get #TAG# put into the subject line (effectively disabling tagging).  Evaluating Individual Email Scores  If the EGW_SAVE_EMAIL_HEADERS configuration setting is enabled in your Â Oracle B2C Service application, you can view the email header of an incident by clicking on the envelope icon next to the contact name in the incident thread. The envelope only displays if the end-user submits the incident or an update to an incident via email (and not the Ask a Question or Account - Â Questions page). For more information on this setting, refer to Answer ID 1595: Enabling Email Headers for Incidents. Within the email header, look for a section similar to the following: X-Barracuda-Spam-Score: 2.07 X-Barracuda-Spam-Status: No, SCORE=2.07 using per-user scores of TAG_LEVEL=3.5 QUARANTINE_LEVEL=9.0 KILL_LEVEL=1000.0 tests=HTML_ATTR_UNIQUE, HTML_IMAGE_RATIO_04, THREAD_INDEX, THREAD_TOPIC, X_PRIORITY_HIGH X-Barracuda-Spam-Report: Code version 3.02, rules version 3.0.17279 Rule breakdown below pts rule name description ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0.30 THREAD_TOPIC Thread-Topic: ...(Japanese Subject)... 0.12 X_PRIORITY_HIGH Sent with 'X-Priority' set to high 0.30 THREAD_INDEX thread-index: AcO7Y8iR61tzADqsRmmc5wNiFHEOig== 0.18 HTML_IMAGE_RATIO_04 BODY: HTML has a low ratio of text to image area 1.17 HTML_ATTR_UNIQUE BODY: HTML appears to have random attributes in tags  In this case, the score calculated for the incoming email is 2.07. Within the following lines of the header, the TAG_LEVEL, QUARANTINE_LEVEL, and KILL_LEVEL correspond to the Tag, Quarantine, and Block scores configured in the Barracuda. This allows you to determine how the individual email compared to your scores. The section below the dashed lines is a breakout of how the email's spam score was calculated based on the attributes within that email.  Determining Appropriate Scores  You can review the scores of both Spam messages and legitimate messages in order to determine the score values to set in the Barracuda for your mailbox. By evaluating the spam scores for email that should be blocked or quarantined, you can determine the threshold values to use for tagging, quarantining, or blocking incoming email. You can experiment with the scores by disabling the quarantine feature on the Preferences &gt; Quarantine Settings page (by default, this is disabled), and then adjusting the Tag and Quarantine scores. This allows you to see two levels of scores in the Support Console just by examining the subject line of incoming incidents. During this process, blocking should be disabled (Block score at 10). Determining the scoring values involves some experimentation. Set the Tag score to be the value that you want to use for the Quarantine score, and set the Quarantine score to be what you want to use for the Block score. With this approach, the Tag score simulates the quarantine action and the Quarantine score simulates the blocking action. Within the Support Console, incidents flagged with #TAG# indicate incidents that should be considered for being quarantined. Incidents with #QUAR# indicate incidents that should be blocked. Watch your incoming incidents for a couple of days. Review the spam scores for the incidents with a #TAG# or #QUAR# in the subject line to determine how effective the tag and quarantine scores are working. Absolutely no legitimate messages should have #QUAR# in the subject -- since these messages will end up being blocked when blocking is enabled. If any legitimate messages are flagged with #QUAR#, evaluate the spam score for those messages and then raise the quarantine score to be above that value. Similarly, incidents with #TAG# in the subject indicate incidents that will be quarantined. If too many legitimate messages are getting #TAG# added to the subject line, increase the Tag score a little - in increments of 0.2 or 0.3. For example, if the Tag score starts with a value of 3.5, you could raise it to 3.7 or 3.8 and then if necessary, raise it further. If several SPAM messages are creating incidents without either #TAG# or #QUAR#, then lower the Tag and/or Quarantine score, so that these incidents would at least be quarantined or even blocked. When adjusting the scores, you need to find a balance that allows only a few Spam messages into the Support Console without a #TAG# or #QUAR# while keeping legitimate messages that receive #TAG# in the subject to a minimum. Ideally, if possible, 0 legitimate messages should be flagged with #TAG#. Once you have adjusted your scores, let the system run with that configuration for what you consider an adequate amount of time -- one week, a month, or whatever you are comfortable with. Continue to evaluate the scores to verify that Spam incidents are getting blocked adequately and then no legitimate incidents have a #QUAR# in the subject line. Then, once you are comfortable with which incidents are being flagged with #QUAR# and #TAG#, you can implement blocking and the quarantine on your site. Set the Quarantine score value to be the value you used for tagging. Then, set the Block score to be the value used for the quarantine. Next, enable the quarantine feature from the Preferences &gt; Quarantine Settings page in the Barracuda. To enable the quarantine, click Yes for the Enable Quarantine field and then click Save Changes in the heading for that section. You should now receive a minimal amount of Spam while keeping questionable messages on the Barracuda in the quarantine. You can check the quarantine daily or weekly to delete Spam that was quarantined and to deliver any legitimate messages that were quarantined due to the spam score of the email message. For example: You could start with the following scores as a starting point: Tag score = 3.5 Quarantine score = 9.0 (with Quarantine disabled) Block score = 10 (to disable blocking)  By reviewing the incidents coming in, you determine that there are too many Spam messages that are being created with #TAG# instead of #QUAR# and that these should be blocked outright, so you decide to drop the Quarantine score to 8.0. Through additional evaluation, you determine that 3.5 is too low a value for the tag score and that too many legitimate emails would be quarantined, so you test further to determine that the tag score works best if set to 4.2. Therefore, based on testing, the scores that seem to work best are: Tag score = 4.2 Quarantine score = 8.0 (with Quarantine disabled) Block score = 10 (to disable blocking)  After running with this configuration for a time, you determine you are ready to implement blocking and quarantine on your mailbox, so you edit the scores to be as follows: Tag score = 4.3 (which disables tagging of incidents) Quarantine score = 4.2 Block score = 8.0 (so blocking is enabled)  Then, you need to enable the quarantine feature on the Preferences &gt; Quarantine Settings page. Note: To disable tagging (including #TAG# in the subject line of incidents), set the Tag score to be greater than the Quarantine score. If you wish to tag incidents, you can set the Tag score to be less than the Quarantine score. This allows you to further evaluate whether the Quarantine threshold should be modified further.

Associating a contact to an incident;Answer ID 2516;When creating a new incident, how do I add contact information to the incident?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 2483'];  Contacts / Organization, Incident Association;" You are able to create a new contact when creating an incident. Â  From the Incident workspace click on the Contact tab, and select Add. Â  This will bring up a window allowing you to create a new contact. When creating a new incident, you may need to create a new contact record at the same time. In other cases, the contact record may already exist and you need to create a new incident for that record. Â The steps and options for creating new incidents and associating contact information to the incident are provided below. Workspace requirements: When associating contacts to incidents, your incident workspace MUST include the Contact field with a magnifying glass icon. This allows Â staff to search for the contact from within the incident. When editing Â an incident workspace, this field is added from the Toolbox by expanding the Incidents table and dragging the Contact field listed under the Incidents table. In addition, if you wish to add incidents to open contact records, the contact workspace MUST include the Incident View relationship item in the workspace. The default contact workspace includes the Incident View item on the Incidents tab. For more information on editing workspaces, refer to Answer ID 2483: Setting Up a New Workspace.  Creating a New Incident and a New Contact Record If the contact record does not already exist in your site, Â you must create both the contact record and the incident and associate them together. You can start with either record first and then create the other record and then save them both. Option 1: Creating the Incident first. Â  You can open a new incident and then Â create a contact record from within the incident. Select New &gt; Incident from the upper left corner of the Agent Console.  Â  Right click on the Contact field and select Add New. Â  Or click the magnifying glass icon and select Â New Contact. Â The contact editor / workspace opens.  Â  In the contact editor, add your contact information, including name, email address, login information and custom fields.  Â  Click OK. Â  The contact editor closes.  Â  Important: At this point, the contact name populates the Contact field in the incident. Â  However, the contact record Â has not yet been saved to the database. Â  The contact record is created Â when the incident is saved. If you cancel the incident from being created, the contact record is not saved to the database either.  Â  Fill out the incident information and save the incident. Â  At this point, both the incident and contact record Â are saved and added to the database.  Option 2: Creating the Contact Record Â First: Â  You can Â create your contact record first and then open an incident while adding the contact. Select New &gt; Contact from the upper left corner of the Agent Console. The contact editor / workspace opens.  Â  Add contact information in the editor.  Â  Click the Incidents tab and Â click New. Â  The incident workspace / editor Â opens. Note that the contact's name populates the Contact field in the incident.  Â  Fill out the incident information and click OK.  Â  Important:  Â The incident editor closes and the incident displays on the Incidents tab in the contact record. The incident, however, is not yet saved to the database. You must finish saving the contact record in order to create and execute any actions associated with the incident Â (such as sending a response). If you cancel the contact record (close without saving), then the incident is not saved to the database either.  Â  Save the contact record. At that point, both the contact and incident are added to the database and any actions associated with the incident such as sending a response to the contact are executed.  Â   Creating a New Incident for an Existing Contact If your contact already exists in your site, you can associate the contact to the incident in a couple of ways. Â  You can search for the contact and then create a new incident for the contact or you can create the new incident and then associate the contact to the incident. Option 1: New Incident from a Contact Report. Â  You can run a report that lists the contact record to be used with the incident and then create an incident specifically for that contact record. Run a report that lists contact records or incidents Â and use search criteria so that the contact of interest is listed in the report output.  Â  From the report, right click on the contact record and select New &gt; Incident (For selected Org / Contact). This creates a new incident that is automatically associated to the contact record you selected. Â  In the new incident, the Contact field in the incident workspace displays the first and last name of the contact. When you click the Contacts tab, the contact information displays and is editable. Note: From the report, you can also click on the contact record to highlight that row in the report Â and then click the small down arrow beneath the New button in the toolbar and select Incident (For selected Org / Contact). Â  Â  Option 2: Associate Contact to New Incident. Â  You can also start with a new, blank incident and from the incident editor, you can associate the contact of interest to your new incident. Note: To use this option, your incident workspace MUST include the Contact field with a magnifying glass icon to allow you to search for the contact from within the incident. Create a new incident. Â  You can either select New &gt; Incident from the upper left corner of your console or if you have an incidents report open, you can click the New button from the toolbar.  Â  Click the magnifying glass next to the Contact field.  Â  In the pop-up window, search for the contact of interest by name or other criteria such as email address or organization. Â  From the search results, Â double click on the contact Â record or click on the contact record and Â click Select. When the search window Â closes, the contact's name populates the Contact field.  Â When you click the Contacts tab, the contact information is listed and you can edit the fields if necessary (and your staff profile allows you to edit contacts). With the contact associated to the incident, you can fill out the incident information and proceed with handling the incident."

Setting properties in workspaces;Answer ID 2518;How do I set properties within workspaces?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 11374'];   Workspaces, Field and control properties;"  When configuring workspaces, different items within the workspace Â have different properties associated depending on the type of element involved. Â  Â   Database fields, including custom fields, generally have properties that are most common across several fields and features. This includes properties such as spell checking, read-only, and required Â properties. Â    Relationship items and controls Â typically have properties that are more unique and specific to that item. For example, in an incident workspace, the Incident Thread relationship item (which is on the Messages tab by default) includes the Send Response Default and Commit Response on Save properties. Â  These properties are unique to the incident thread item only.  For comprehensive information regarding workspaces, refer to the 'Workspaces' section in online documentation for the version your site is on. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Setting Properties in Â a Workspace  To view and set the properties for an Â item in a workspace, Â use the steps below:  From the navigation pane items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces / Workflows.   In the right frame, open the workspace for editing. Â  For a standard workspace, you must copy the workspace and then open the copy for editing.   Within the workspace, click on the specific item. When the item is selected, it is surrounded by a dashed line.   When you select an item in the workspace, the properties for that item display.   To change the value of the property, click the property and edit the value.   If you modified any properties, save the workspace.  Note: Â  If you copied a standard workspace and edited the copy, you must update the staff profiles to use the saved copy instead of the standard workspace.  Mandatory Required Fields in Workspaces Â  When creating a custom workspace, certain fields may be required by the system for Â that type of Â workspace. You Â must include Â those fields when creating a custom workspace. Â  Required fields are already included in the standard workspaces Â that are configured Â within the application. For example, when creating an answer workspace, the Summary field is required in order to save a new answer. As a result, your workspace must have the Summary field included in order to save answers in your application. In addition, some fields are set as required by default. For most fields, the Required Option property allows you to specify whether the field is required when a staff member uses that workspace. In the workspace designer, required fields are Â designated in red Â with an asterisk. Â  For a list of required fields for each workspace, refer to ""Required fields"". Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Profile-based Field Â Properties  Database fields Hidden, Read Only and Required Â properties can be based on Â profiles. Â  For example, Â in a single workspace, you can make Â fields required for Â some profiles and not required for other profiles. Â Similarly, you can make fields read-only or hidden for some profiles and not for others. Â  This allows you to use a single workspace across several profiles that may have different properties for different fields. These Â Hidden, Read Only and Required Â properties can take on one of the following values:  On New On Open Profile Based  For example, Â the Â Required property can be the following:  On New: Â The field is Â required for all profiles when creating new records.   On Open: Â The field is Â required for all profiles Â when editing/opening an existing record.   Profile Based: Â This property will make records required for selected profiles when creating or opening a record.  To set profile-based values for the Hidden, Read Only and Required Â properties:  Click the item and then from the Design tab, click the property and select Profile Based. Â  For example, click a custom field and from the Design tab, click Read Only &gt; Profile based.  Â  In the pop-up window, enable the checkboxes for the appropriate profile so that the property is in Â effect for new records or when opening existing records.    For more information on profile-based properties, Â refer to ""Setting hidden, required, and read-only properties"" within the online documentation. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Hidden and Read-only Properties for Required Fields  If a field is Â required, you can only set the Read Only or Hidden Â properties under specific conditions. Â  Namely, if the field is configured to use a default value, for new records and the field is required, then you can set that field to be read-only or hidden for new records. Â  If the field is required for new records and no default value is set, you cannot set that field to be read-only or hidden on new records. That is, if the field is required on new records, the staff member must be able to access and Â edit that field to set the value. Â  As a result, you cannot make a field read-only or hidden on new records if it is required and does not have a default value.  For additional information, refer to the 'Field and control properties' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Changing the height of a hierarchical field in a workspace;Answer ID 2520;Is it possible to change the height of hierarchical fields such as Assigned, Disposition, Product, and Category in ourÃ‚Â workspace?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 2518', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Workspaces  Issue   I would like forÃ‚Â fields such as Assigned, Product, etcÃ‚Â to onlyÃ‚Â show the lowest level menu selection within the workspaceÃ‚Â instead of the lowest level selection and its parent.;"  When Â configuring a workspace, you can modify the height associated to hierarchical fields to show only the lowest level of values by editing the Show Parent property within the workspace. At most you can show two levels of a hierarchical field.  When Show Parent is disabled (set to False), the box for the selected field displays a single line Â and only displays the lowest level selection in the menu.   When Show Parent is enabled (set to True), the box for the field shows two levels -- the lowest level selected and the value immediately above it.  To modify the property, use the steps below: Â   From the Â Configuration items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces Â    Double-click on the appropriate workspace Â to Open and Edit. Â   Note: Â  To determine which workspace to edit, you may need to Â open the staff profile to determine which workspace is called out. For example, to determine which incident workspace is used by a staff member, Â open the profile and click the Service tab to see which incident workspace is listed. Â    In the open workspace, click on Â the hierarchical field you wish to Â edit, such as Disposition, Product, Category, or Assigned. Â  Â    From the Design tab Â on the ribbon, click the Â Show Parent property.   Save the workspace.  For more information on editing workspace properties, refer to Answer ID 2518: Setting Properties in Workspaces.

Creating drill-down reports;Answer ID 2523;How do I create a report that has drill-down levels so that I can have summary information at the top level but then view specific records at a more detailed level?;['Answer ID 2511', 'Answer ID 2509'];  Analytics, Rollups and Slices;"  Rollups and Slices You can use rollups or slices to collapse records based on a common value in your report. This, in effect, creates a drill-down level based on the field used to configure the slice or rollup. For example, if you have a report that lists all the unassigned incidents in your site, you can create a rollup Â based on the staff group or even the staff account. Â  When the rollup is configured, all the incidents assigned to Â the staff groups or staff accounts are Â grouped together in the report based. When you expand the rollup, you can view the individual records assigned to the specific staff group or staff account. Similarly, slices allow you to list the values for the slice you create and if you display the slices in a tree format, you can include group counts so that the slices and group counts display to the left of the overall report. When you click on a specific slice only the records associated with that record display. Rollups and slices can either be configured as part of the saved report so that when the report is run, the rollup or slice is generated as part of the report or they can be added to a report after the report is generated. Rollups and slices are added to a report either in edit mode or after the report has been run. Â  From the Home tab, select Rollup or Slice and select Choose Columns to define the grouping. For more information on slices and rollups, refer to Answer ID 2511: Using Slicing and Rollups with Reports.  Adding Drill-down Levels to a Report Â  When configuring a report, you can include drill-down levels so that staff can view summary information from the top level of the report and then click on a row of data or link within that row to view more detailed records and information. Drill-down levels are configured as part of the report and cannot be added or removed after the report is generated. The top level of the report typically includes some kind of grouping of records. Most frequently, the Count(expr) aggregate function is used with at least one field at the top level. That way, the count of the number of supporting records displays in the top level. Then, the user can drill down to see the specific records reported in the count number. For example, you can create a report that lists your active customers along with a count of their support incidents and a count of sales opportunities associated to them. Â  Then, you can create a drill-down so that when staff click on the count of incidents, they view the incidents assigned to the customer. Similarly, you can create a drill-down level so that when staff click on the count of sales opportunities, they can see the specific opportunities for that customer. To add a drill-down level to a report, you must first determine what information to display at the top level and then determine what information to display in the drill-down levels. Â  Then, you can add the additional levels and define the output columns for each additional level. To configure a report with a drill-down level, use the steps below. For more information on creating a single-level report, including adding report filters and output columns, Â refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a Basic Custom Report. From the toolbar, select New &gt; Report or open a report for editing.  Â  In the report outline, define the filters used for the report.  Â  Drag and drop fields from the Data Dictionary section to the Data Area. Â   Â  To add a function (such as Count) to the output column, right click on the output column, Â select Edit Definition and edit the Expression field to be Count(table.field_name). Â  Then, click OK.  Â  In the Report Outline area, under the Output Levels heading, right click on the report level and select Add Drilldown.  Â  Add the name for the level and a brief description.  Â  In the Drilldown Settings area, set the Filter field to the field or fields used to group and filter the data into subgroups. For example, if you want to drill down to see incidents assigned to a specific status, the filter is incidents.status.  Â  For the Link field, indicate which field should be used to access the drill down level. Â  Or select Entire Row and the user can double click anywhere on the row to drill down.  Â  Click OK.  Â  In the new report level, drag and drop output columns into the Data Area.  Â  Add additional drill down levels as appropriate.  Â  Save your report. Â   After saving the report, run your report and verify that the links work as you expect and that the data displays correctly."

Oracle B2C Service - Product Release Updates;Answer ID 2525;What areÃ‚Â product updatesÃ‚Â and how are they applied?;['Answer ID 9013', 'Answer ID 7223', 'Answer ID 7224'];   Software updates for supported versions Oracle B2C Service;  Oracle periodically issues software updates for supported versions of Oracle B2C Service. Â  Â The purpose of these updates are to improve the capabilities of the service and/or to re-mediate known defects. Oracle's update technology utilizes a lightweight background process that minimizes impact on your network resources, requires no involvement from your IS team, and is seamless to customers and staff members. The key benefits of this technology include:  Important updates are deployed without requiring a full site update A low-bandwidth download process ensures minimal impact on network resources No impact to IS team or staff members currently using the workstation  Delivery The application of an update is not expected to result in downtime or reduced functionality and special preparation is not necessary for your agents and end-users. When the smart client detects that a new Â update is available, it automatically downloads the update using a low-bandwidth, background process so that any current staff member activity on the workstation is not impacted. Once the update has been downloaded and deployed, it will be activated the next time the staff member logs into the application. Because all updated files have been previously downloaded and deployed, the time required to log in is not significantly impacted. In the rare event an update should fail, a service request Â will be generated automatically and Technical Support will troubleshoot the issue. Content and Schedule There are several different types of Â updates including Maintenance Packs, Â Patches and Untested Patches. Â  Â All types of updates are built and deployed using the same technology. Â  Â The type of Â update is dictated solely by differences in the content and schedule. Â  Â The update process is designed to cause no impact to your service. However, because maintenance is being conducted, we want you to understand when it will occur. Â  Â See the answers below for additional descriptions of each type and for application scheduling (where available): Oracle B2C Service Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Maintenance Packs Oracle B2C Service Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Patches Oracle B2C Service Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Untested Patches Refer to the Â Support Notifications Â portal for service Â notifications relating to Â system updates. Important information It is imperative that customers indicate an accurate synopsis of the impact a defect has to their business when they report a problem to Technical Support so Oracle can determine if the defect needs to be fixed in an update. Oracle does not take additional action based on customer requests for an update. Â  Oracle determines when a product defect will be fixed through a release update as well as the type that will be used to deliver the fix. Â  Â Oracle strives to fix severe issues when it is possible. Â  Â  If the fix requires the implementation of new features, schema changes, or changes to customer-facing user interfaces and APIs, customers will be required to update for the fix.

Reporting on staff profile characteristics;Answer ID 2528;How can we report on our staff profiles?;['Answer ID 2527'];   Analytics,Ã‚Â Profiles / Accounts All versions;"  Standard Reports  Two standard reports allow you to view staff account information based on profile permissions. For more information on the Accounts by Profile Permission (Report ID 13004) Â and Profile Permissions by Account (Report ID 13003) Â reports, refer to Answer ID 2527: Administration Reports in RightNow.  Custom Reports using the Profiles Â Table  Â  You Â can include the profiles database table in a custom report. This allows you to create a list of staff profiles that are configured in your site. Within the profiles table, several fields indicate permissions granted on each of the profile tabs. Â  These permissions fields are all bitmaps where each checkbox on the tab corresponds to a numerical value. Â  The value of the permission field is the sum of the checkbox numbers.  Permissions as filters: You can include permission fields as filters within a report. Â  Use the In List operator to enable specific permission checkboxes of interest. Profiles with any of the selected permissions will be included in your report. Within a filter, Â the filter uses an OR join between multiple checkboxes that are enabled. That is if you include the css_perms field as a filter and set the filter to use an operator of ""in list"", if you enable both the Incident View and Incident Edit options, profiles that have either of those permissions enabled (but not necessarily both) Â are returned in the report.  Permissions as output columns: When displayed as an output column, the permission field lists which checkboxes are enabled on the corresponding tab. For example, if you include the CSS Permissions field in the report, the field displays similar to:  Incident View, Incident Edit, Incident Respond, Answer Edit, Answer Set Public, Assign Other Groups  In this case, the Incident Delete and Answer Delete options are not listed, which indicates that those boxes are not enabled in the staff profile.  Types of permission fields: Â  The permission fields listed below correspond to features enabled in Â specific profiles tabs.  Contact Permissions -- (contact_perms) -- Includes options enabled on the Contacts tab.   CSS Permissions -- (css_perms) -- Includes options enabled on the Service tab when Oracle B2C Service is enabled.   Global Permissions -- (global_perms) -- Includes options enabled on the Common, Analytics and Tasks tabs.   MA Permissions -- (ma_perms) -- Includes options enabled on the Outreach tab when Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service is enabled.   Org Permissions -- (org_perms) -- Includes options enabled on the Organization tab.   SA Permissions -- (sa_perms) -- Includes options enabled on the Sales tab when Oracle RightNow Opportunity Tracking Cloud Service is enabled.   Survey Permissions -- (survey_perms) -- Includes options enabled on the Surveys tab when Oracle RightNow Feedback Cloud Service is enabled.  From the profiles table, you can also report on other profile features such as the inbox limit, incident pull policy and the pull policy and pull quantity. Note: Staff whose staff profile has the Administration box checked can also access descriptions for the profiles table from the data dictionary. If your staff profile has the Administration box checked on the Common tab, you can access the data dictionary from the path: Common Administration Items &gt; Database Administration &gt; Data Dictionary."

Updates to incidents are included as text file attachments;Answer ID 2529;Some of our end-user updates to incidents are included as a file attachment to the incident instead of an update to the incident thread.Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 5168'];   Incident, Incoming email, Service Mailboxes Oracle B2C Service;"  If Â an email exceeds the Maximum Description Size Â value, the email is Â appended to the incident as a Â file attachment and a small thread entry refers agents to the attached file. Â  Â This reduces the possibility of long emails being cut in half, which Â may Â leave malformed HTML in the attachment. Â  Â  To allow the majority of these emails to be added as incident threads instead of being added as attachments, you must Â increase the Maximum Description Size value. Â The maximum value allowed for this field is 1,048,576. The default is 250,000. Â  The Maximum Description Size value is configured individually for each mailbox that is configured in your site. Â Therefore, if you have multiple mailboxes configured, you must update the Maximum Description Size for each mailbox. To modify the Maximum Description Size, use the steps below:  From the Configuration items, select Site Configuration &gt; Â Mailboxes. The mailbox tree displays on the content pane.  Â  Expand the Service Mailboxes tree and double click on the Â mailbox Â listed in the left frame. On the ribbon, click the Incoming Email button.  Â  Change the Maximum Description Size value. Â The maximum value allowed for this field is 1,048,576. Â We don't recommend using the maximum value, as this could prevent you from sending responses on your incidents.  Â  Click Save.  For additional information, refer to the Â 'Editing Oracle-managed Service Mailboxes' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  Determining the appropriate value to use depends on the configuration of your site, the nature of your business and the emails you receive from your end-users. In general, setting this value somewhere between 25000 and 50000 should correct most of the cases where an attachment is appended rather than the incident thread being updated. Â  Â  In each case when an email is attached as text file there is a note inserted into the thread of the incident similar to the following: ""=============== Â text Â File Â Attachment Â ============== Attachment Â 1.txt, Â 6032 Â bytes, Â added Â to Â incident"" The size of the email is listed in this information. Â  Â You can use these values to determine the value of your Maximum Description Size configuration."

Admin_vis field in answer reports;Answer ID 2530;In our answer report, there is a filter for answers.admin_vis. What does that filter do?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Analytics Oracle B2C Service;" The answers.admin_vis field Â can be added as a filter to answer reports. This filter allows you to delineate answers associated with Â different interfaces based on which products and categories the answer is assigned to. If an answer is assigned to at least one product and category that is enabled for administration visibility for the interface that you are running the report from, then the answers.admin_vis field is evaluated as Yes. Â  This allows you to report on answers that are associated with products and categories for the interface you are working in. The answers.admin_vis feature is not an actual field in the answers database table. Â  Therefore, it is not listed in the data dictionary and cannot be used as an output column in a report. It is only visible when adding filters to a report. To add the admin_vis feature as a filter in a report, use the steps below: Open an answers report for editing.  Â  From the Home tab, click Add Filter from the Data Set section. Â  Â   Â  Right click in the Expressions field and select Answers &gt; Admin Visibility. Â  The Expression field is populated with answers.admin_vis.  Â  Set the Operator field to in list and set the Value options to the default values you wish.  Â  Configure the rest of the filter, including adding a name and indicating whether it can be edited at run-time.  Â  Click OK and save the report.  By including a filter Â in the report with Answers.admin_vis equal to Yes, only the answers that are assigned to a product and category combination that are enabled for administration visibility for that interface are returned. Â  Â Answers that are assigned to product and category combinations that are only visible to other interfaces are not included in the report. This allows your knowledge engineers the ability to access only those answers with a product and category combination for the interface they work in. If you do not include a filter for answers.admin_vis in the report, all answers in your site are eligible to be returned regardless of the product and category visibility. Â  This allows knowledge engineers the ability to access and manage all answers in their site while being logged in to a single interface. Â  Answers, of course, may be excluded based on other filters in the report."

Conditional formatting of a column in a report;Answer ID 2532;How can I customizeÃ‚Â certain cells in my report using conditional formatting?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics;"  You can use conditional formatting to customize the display of output columns in your report. Â  Conditional formatting only affects the display of cells in that output column. Â  To affect an entire row in your report, you must define data exceptions.  Conditional Formatting  You can use conditional formatting Â to customize the cells in Â an output Â column of your report. Â You can define certain criteria and then define Â how the text displays by changing the Â color, font face and size, Â or the Â style (bold, italics or underlined). Â  You can also include an image or flag within the cell, such as a check mark, flag, Â circle or Â arrow. Â  For example:  In an incident report that includes multiple statuses, you can create a conditional format to list unresolved statuses in red and waiting statuses in blue. Â    In Â an answer report that lists public answers and their score, Â you can set a conditional Â format to display answers with a score less than 50 in blue with a down arrow Â next to it.  The criteria you define must be based on the value in the output column. Â  That is, if you add conditional formatting to Â the incident status that is listed Â as an output column, you must define the conditional criteria Â based on incident status. You cannot define the conditional formatting based on the status type. Conditional formatting can be defined and saved Â as part of the report, so that when the report is run, cells within the output column display in Â the format defined for the criteria. Â  You can also apply conditional formatting after the report is run. This allows you to evaluate your report and then flag cells that meet certain criteria of interest.  To add a conditional format to an output column of your report:  To save the conditional format as part of the report, open the report for editing. Â  Otherwise, run the report.   Right click on the output column and select Edit Format.   Click the Conditional tab and click Add.   On the condition tab, set the operator and value to complete the IF statement. For example, if you are flagging all incidents with an unresolved status as red, set the Operator field to ""in list"" and set the Value field to ""Unresolved"".   Click the Format tab.   Set the Display field to display either just the text for the cell, just an image for the cell or both an image and text.   If including an image, set which type of image to display. Click Â the Change Color link to change the color of the image as well.   To change the style of the text, click the Change Style link to the right of the Preview field.   Click OK.   Add additional conditions and formatting as you wish.  Multiple conditional formats: Â  When adding multiple formats to a column, the order of those formats affects how the cells display. Once a value in the output column matches a conditional format, that value is not evaluated against Â any other conditional formats that you have configured. Â  As a result, your most stringent criteria should be listed first. For example, in an answer report, Â you can flag the answer score column in red if the score is less than 10 Â and flag the score as blue if Â it is less than 50. Â  In this case, Â you would set up two conditional formats on the answer score column in your report: Â   IF Â Score &lt; 10, then show red, and  Â  IF Score &lt; 50, then show blue  In this case, order the conditional formats so that the first criteria to evaluate is if the score is less than 10. Â  That way, if a cell is less than 10, it shows in red and does not get compared to the other conditional format that you configured.  For additional information, refer to the Edit conditional format options Â section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Â To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Reports in navigation panes are grayed out for staff members;Answer ID 2533;Why are reports grayed out in navigation panes?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Navigation Sets Oracle B2C Service;  If a staff member logs in and see that reports in their navigation set or quick search are grayed out, this is due to the permission configuration on the report. Â  If the staff member's profile does not have permission to run the report, that report is grayed out in the navigation set. To resolve this, as an administrator, use the steps below:  Open the Reports explorer and find the report that is grayed out. Â  Right click on the report and select Edit. For system-defined reports, you can only edit the scheduling and permissions. Â  If the report is a custom report, click the Permissions button. Â The Permissions button is accessed from the Home tab. Â  Â  For the staff Â profile, enable the Open check box next to the profile name. Â  Â  Save and close the report. Â   After editing the report permissions, have the staff member log out and log back in order to run the reports.

Rulebase compile error for Then and Else clauses;Answer ID 2534;Why do I receive a 'Rulebase Compile Error' when compiling my rulebase?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Business Rules Issue  When I try to compile our rules, I get an error:   Rulebase Compile ErrorÃ‚Â  Rules following 'Rule Name' will never be evaluated. Both the Then and Else clause of this rule contain a Stop.; When creating rules, if you include the action Transition State and Stop in both the THEN and the ELSE clauses of the rule, you cannot list other rules beneath that rule or you will get the following error: Rulebase Compile Error Rules following 'Rule Name' will never be evaluated. Both the Then and Else clause of this rule contain a Stop. Due to the Transition State and Stop action in both parts of the rule, all records will be transitioned to another state. Â  As a result, Â there is no way for a record to continue past that rule to be compared to any rules listed beneath it. To resolve this, you must either: Modify the rule so that either the THEN or ELSE clause does not transition to another state, or  Â  Reorder your rules so that the rule with the Transition State and Stop actions is listed last within the rule state.

Creating Oracle Service Chat transcripts;Answer ID 2536;Do I have to create incidents in order to store our chat transcripts?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Chat, Transcripts;" Incidents are no longer the only means of storing Â chat transcripts. Historical chat transcripts can be reviewed through Â standard report ""Chat Event Details"" (Report ID 3029).  Â Additionally at the time of review, a new incident can be created or the chat transcript can be appended to an existing incident. Note: Â In February 2012 and later releases there is an additional standard chat report called ""Chat Events"" (Report ID 3054). A custom report utilizing the chats table can be created to review chat transcripts. Â  Â When a report is created based on this table and Â a record is viewed from the report's output, the console Â automatically associates the chat transcript to the engagement. Note: Â  Â The functionality to create a new incident or append the chat transcript to an existing incident Â depends on whether the agent's Chat Session workspace includes the New Incident or Add to Incident buttons."

Increasing the height above a tabset in a workspace;Answer ID 2540;How can I increase the height of the area above the tabset in our workspace (or decrease the height of the tabs)?;['Answer ID 2518'];  Workspaces, All versions;" When editing workspaces, you can modify the height of the summary Â area above the primary Â tabset. Â  This allows you to add fields or change the display as you need. Â  Or you can remove fields from the summary pane and then decrease its height to allow more space for the tab content. When you add a tabset to a workspace, the Summary Panel Height Â property defines the amount of space (in pixels) Â above the tabset that can be used for specific fields. The summary pane displays regardless of which tab is selected. To modify the summary Â pane Â height above the tabset, use the steps below: From the Â Configuration Items, select Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces.  Â  Open the appropriate workspace for editing. If it is a standard workspace, you must copy Â the workspace Â and open the copy for editing.

Including file attachments with mailings and surveys;Answer ID 2542;When I send the mailing as a proof,Ã‚Â why aren't theÃ‚Â attachmentsÃ‚Â appearing in my email?;['Answer ID 2518'];   Outreach and Feedback, Surveys and Mailings, Attachments;"  From the Summary tab, you can include file attachment to a mailing or survey and that file becomes permanently attached to the mailing. The Attachments tab lists any files attached to the mailing and contains the file name, size, content type, and description. Files attached to the mailing in this way are intended Â to be Â supporting information or documentation related to the mailing or survey. Â These attachment are not sent to customers. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   Linking to files: You can Â add files to your Â Oracle B2C Service application Â in the Content Library. Â  These files Â can be included in mailings and surveys. Â  These files can be viewed by contacts who receive your mailings or surveys. After Â the files are added, you can use them as many times as you want in several mailings or surveys. With the files added to the Files explorer, you can include links to the files Â within documents, templates, and snippets. Â  The recipient receives a link within the mailing or survey invitation message Â that links to the file you have added. With this approach you do not have to worry about the attachment itself being blocked from delivery. Note: Â  Oracle B2C Service's marketing best practices indicate that it is best to not send files as attachments to mailings Â for the following reasons: Emails with attachments may be blocked Â from delivery due to virus risks and/or spam identification procedures. Attachments also contribute to exceeding email account quotas (B2C marketing to personal email accounts), and to increased download times, delivery times and hardware requirements. Instead, include a link to the attachment(s) and give contacts the option to read the document on-line or download where appropriate.  To add a file that can be used as a link in a mailing: Â Add the file to the Content Library:  From the console, select New &gt; Content Library &gt; File.   Click Browse to locate the file to upload.   To disable the file from being added to mailings, click the Menu Access Disabled checkbox. Â  This prevents staff from including the file in a mailing.   To disable the file from being viewed by recipients, enable the End User Access Disabled box. This allows you to disable a file after a period of time has passed from when the file was included in a mailing.   Add a description of the file.   Click Save. Â  Add a name for the file and click the Save button.  To include a file link within a mailing: Â  Once the file is defined in the Content Library &gt; Files explorer, and if the file is not disabled from menu access, staff can include a link to the file in their mailing. Links to files can also be included in the invitation message to a survey:  Open the mailing for editing and click the Messages tab. Or open the survey for editing and click the Invitation Message tab.   From the Toolbox, click File Link.   From the pop-up window, select the file. Â    In the Text field, add the text used for the link. You can also specify additional class or style attributes as well as target attributes for the link that is created.   Click OK to close the Insert File Attachment window.   Modify your mailing or survey and then save, proof, and send the mailing or launch the survey.  When the recipient receives the mailing or survey, they can click the link within the email to view the attachment."

Using a sitemap with our Oracle B2C Service application;Answer ID 2553;What is the sitemap featureÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â Oracle B2C ServiceÃ‚Â and how can I use it for my site?;['Answer ID 31'];   Sitemap Oracle B2C Service sites, All versions;"  Search engines use web crawlers (spiders) to explore your website and index the pages that will be available when searches are conducted. They usually find the pages from links within your site and from other sites. But you may have pages that are not accessible by browsing on the interface (for example, pages that are accessed only when customers complete a form). The spider will not be able to index those pages because it cannot access them. Content in iFrames is not searched and indexed either. Sitemap lets you inform search engines about all the answer links that are available on your site, including those that are not accessible through links. Sitemap is an XML-based protocol used by the major search engines, including Yahoo! and Google. By using the Sitemap protocol, you can identify all the web pages on your customer portal instead of waiting for the search engine spiders to find them. For more information on sitemap technology, refer to http://www.sitemaps.org.   The Â Sitemap page is an XML-formatted document on a web server that lists all the URLs for a site along with metadata for each URL, including the priority of each page and when it was last updated. Spiders use the page to crawl your end-user interface more intelligently rather than relying solely on links within the site. When a site is requested through Configuration Assistant, Sitemap is not enabled by default. If you wish to have it enabled, submit a service request Â with Technical Support. Â  Alternatively, if your site is newly provisioned, then Sitemap Â is enabled. A Sitemap page is created and registered with Yahoo and Google. Â The XML output of the page is available at: https://&lt;your_site&gt;/ci/sitemap The HTML output of the page is at: https://&lt;your_site&gt;/ci/sitemap/html  If you want to disable Sitemap, you can submit a service request to Ask Technical Support. If you have previously had the Sitemap disabled, you can submit a service request to have this feature re-enabled which automatically creates a sitemap that lists the contents of your end-user pages. You should be able to view the content of your site's robots.txt file via the following path: http://&lt;interface_name&gt;.custhelp.com/robots.txt  Important password considerations: Â  If Â passwords are required for your end-user pages, a sitemap Â can still be created and registered. However, due to the password requirement, search engines will be unable to reach any of the URLs listed in the sitemap file. As a result, search engines will not report results if end-user passwords are required for your end-user pages. Note: Â  Some of the security settings Â that restrict end user access such as SEC_VALID_ENDUSER_HOSTS and Â SEC_INVALID_ENDUSER_HOSTS can also impact whether the spider can access this information."

Â  Â Once the contract gets terminated officially, Oracle will contact primary supports of your organization via a support request for final data export process and site disablement. Upon official cancellation, you can receive a one-time data export free of charge. If you wish to have the data parsed in any way, this will require an Oracle Consulting engagement. In this case, please contact your Sales Account Manager. 2) Separately purchased database export The export is provided in MySQL format only.  Â If you want a data Â export in another format, you will need to scope a project with our Oracle Consulting Services team Â in order to export data via the APIs.  Â Please indicate if you are requesting ""Database only"" or a ""Full"" export, which also includes file attachments. If we are not able to post the data on our secure WebDav (e.g Data is too large), we will require a new, sealed hard drive to be supplied to us directly from a seller or re-seller. The drive must Â have a USB connection. All other drives will be returned. For information on what a Â Data Export file looks like, please Â refer to Answer ID 2825: How to decrypt a data dump. Depending on the type and amount of data, data export requests may take up to 1 month to complete. An estimated timeline and a guarantee to complete an export request within a requested time frame is not possible as it is highly dependent on the type and amount of data that is being requested. Note: Should the data export be place on a webdav server Â it will reside there for a maximum of 60 days Â before it is removed. Please note that the Oracle B2C Service Technical Support Team does not process data export requests. Data export requests are processed by the Oracle Consulting Services team.

Exporting and importing reports between sites;Answer ID 2566;How can we share reports between sites?;['Answer ID 75', 'Answer ID 378', 'Answer ID 2572'];   Analytics;"  From the Report Explorer, administrators can export reports from one site and then import them into another. Â  Â When reports are exported, they are saved as an XML file. Â  Â The XML file includes a hash value that is used when the file is imported to determine if the file has been modified externally. If the file has been modified, it is not available for importing, and an error message notifies you that the file is invalid. NOTE: Â  The following action could cause the file to be modified: Â  email as an attachment, copy the file, move the file, open/save. Â  When emailing a report definition, it would be best to zip the file and add a zip file attachment to minimize Â the possibility of a Â file modification.   The report definition includes the filters used in the report along with output columns, drill-down levels, and charts and styles used in the report. Â  Â This allows you to basically copy a report configuration from one application to another. Note: You cannot import reports to earlier versions.  Exporting report data: In all supported versions, you can export data from a report that has been run so that users can review and analyze that data in another format, such as .pdf or .csv format. For more information on exporting report data, refer to Answer ID 75: Exporting reports into another format for analysis  Exporting Report Definitions: To export a report definition, use the steps below. You can export the report after you have run it in the console or while editing the report. If you are exporting from edit mode, be sure to save the report configuration before exporting.  From the Analytics &gt; Reports Explorer or your navigation set, run the report. From the Home tab, click the Definition button and select Export. In the pop-up window, select the folder to save the .xml file to and click Save.   Importing Report Definitions To import a report definition, use the steps below.  From the Analytics &gt; Reports Â Explorer, click New to open a new report. Â  Â Or from the File tab menu, add a new report. In the New Report window, click Import Existing Report Definition. Select the location and XML file to import. If all fields referenced in the XML file exist in the database you are importing into, the report opens in edit mode in the console. Â  Â You can save the report or modify it further and then save it.  If the XML file references fields not configured in the import site, an error message displays listing the fields that cannot be imported. Click OK and the report opens in edit mode so that you can remove or modify the fields indicated in the error message. After removing or modifying the fields, save the report.  Copying reports between interfaces: Â  Â  For a single site with multiple interfaces, you can copy a report from one interface to another without having to export it and then import it to the other interface. Â  Â However, between different sites, you must export the report from one site, and then import it into the other site. Â  Â For more information on copying reports between interfaces in a site, refer to Answer ID 378: Copying a report.  In addition, Â you can also export and import workspace configurations between sites.

Importing Workspaces When importing workspaces, features and fields not available in the site you are importing into are replaced by spacers. This allows the workspace to function within the configuration of the site it is imported into. You can change the type of workspace created. For example, if the exported workspace is a contact workspace, the importer defaults to import it as a contact workspace. Â  However, you have the option of changing workspace types when importing. Upon import, objects that are not used in the workspace type you select are listed for you.

Actions that affect both the production and development pages in Customer Portal;Answer ID 2576;Are there any actionsÃ‚Â that affect both the production and development pages in Customer Portal?;['Answer ID 2566', 'Answer ID 2483', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Customer Portal (CP) Oracle B2C Service;  For the most part the development sandbox is entirely independent of the production site, however there are some actions that affect both the development pages and a production site.  Here are the actions that affect both Customer Portal deployed pages on a production site Â and the development pages:  Editing anything in the assets folder (css, images), with the exception of themes. Â This also includes editing the stock announcement.html file (instead of creating a custom one and updating the page to reference the custom one). Themes are an important exception, as they are the only files in this directory that are not shared by the development and production files. Â These files are used strictly by the development files. When you stage the development pages, these files are copied to a time-stamped folder in the staging directory and called from that folder. The themes you develop are kept in this isolated sandbox that cannot be accessed by production files. The themes are applied to your production site only when you promote the staged files into production. Editing message base values Editing configuration settings Editing custom reports that are referenced in both the production and dev pages. Â  Â For example, if you copy report 166 to generate report_id 101123, if you reference 101123 in your deployed pages and in the development pages, any changes you make to report 101123 would affect both sets of pages. Editing anything else stored in the database, i.e. editing things from the Administration Console. Â  Â This includes editing answer content, adding or editing products and categories, adding or editing custom statuses.  Any changes made to the files in the development folder affect only the development pages, until you deploy them. Changes made to files in other folders may affect both development and production pages when you upload them, without deploying them.

Configuring a report to include inline editing;Answer ID 2583;How can I configure a report to allow inline editing of fields?;['Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Inline Editing option Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  Inline editing is a reporting option that allows staff to edit content directly from a report without having to open the individual record. When inline editing is enabled for a field in a report, when the staff member clicks on the field, a blue box displays for that value. The staff member can click again to edit the value for that field. For example, with an incident report that allows inline editing, if you notice that an incident is assigned to the wrong agent, you can reassign the incident to the correct agent from the report without having to open the incident. If the Status field is also enabled for inline editing, you can edit the status without having to open the record. To configure a report to use inline editing: Â   Verify that your staff profile has the Modify Inline Report Editing box enabled on the Analytics tab.    Profile requirements: Â  In order to configure a report that allows inline editing, the staff profile must have the Modify Inline Report Editing option enabled on the Analytics tab. With this option enabled, when the staff member edits a report, the Properties tab displays an additional button named Editing Options. The Editing Option window allows staff to enable inline editing for specific fields in the report.      Create a new report or copy an existing report.    Copying reports: Â If Â a staff member uses a  Â profile that does not have the Modify Inline Report Editing option enabled but does have the Create/Edit Reports or Create/Edit Public Reports options enabled, that staff member can copy a report that has inline editing. The copy that is created also has inline editing enabled for the fields specified in the original report.  Therefore, when you enable a field for inline editing, other staff may be able to copy that report and make the copy available to other staff members that you did not originally consider. Â   As a result, when enabling inline editing for a specific field, consider who within your organization has the ability to copy reports and create and edit public reports that can be enabled for other staff members.  For more information on creating custom reports, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a Basic Custom Report.      Include the output columns of interest in your report.  Â    See Â Add Output Columns Â for steps to do this.      From the Home tab, click the Inline Editing button located within the Properties Â section.   Enable the Allow inline editing checkbox.   To have inline edits saved automatically, enable the Automatically save inline edit changes check box. If this box is not enabled, staff must manually push a save button in order for their inline edits to be saved to the database.   In the lower pane, enable the checkboxes for the fields that you want to be inline editable. Â   Â    Fields that cannot be edited are listed in gray text and cannot be enabled. This includes fields such as Reference # in an incident report, Answer ID, products and categories Â in an answer report and date fields such as Date Created or Date Last Updated.         Click OK to close the Editing Options window.   Save the report.  When staff run the report, the fields you enabled from the Editing Options window can be edited inline. The fields that are inline editable are highlighted when the mouse hovers over the field. In addition to editing individual rows, staff can edit multiple records at once. Use the CTRL key or Shift key to select multiple records. Then, click Edit Selection from the top of the page and select the field to edit. If the Auto Save button is not enabled, be sure to click Save after editing your records inline so that your edits are saved to the database.  Â  Additional considerations: Â  When editing a report to allow fields to be inline editable, note the items below and how they relate to your report and data.   The following record types are supported for inline editing: Â  Incidents, Contacts, Organizations, Opportunities, Tasks, and Answers. Â  For Â comprehensive information on inline editing with reports, refer to the 'Enable inline editing' and 'Editing data inline' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently on. Â To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.   Several features control whether a staff member can edit a report using inline editing and which fields can be edited:   The report must be configured to allow inline editing.   The staff profile must allow editing for that record type.  The fields enabled for inline editing must be editable. For example, you cannot include incident reference number to be edited inline since that field is not editable in any record.  The field must be in the primary (top) level of the report.  The field cannot be configured with grouping or other functions such as a count, maximum, or minimum function.   Â    Workspace configurations and read-only properties: Â  Â Inline editing may allow edit access to Â fields that otherwise cannot be edited by the staff member using a specific workspace. Â   Â  For example, within a workspace, you may restrict access to specific fields or make them read-only Â for certain profiles. Â If you allow those fields to be inline editable in a report outside the workspace, staff who Â cannot edit the field from the workspace can edit the field from the report if they are granted access to the report. Please note, it is not possible to use inline editing in a workspace.   Include the proper field in the report: Â  When including fields in your report, some fields include the same information, but one field may be editable and the other may not be. Evaluate the Â fields to Â determine which is best to include in the report.  Â  For example, in an incident report, you can include either the incidents.assgn_acct_id field or the Â accounts.full_name field as an output column to indicate which staff member is associated with the incident.  Â  In this case, the incidents.assgn_acct_id field is editable and can be enabled for inline editing. Â  However, the accounts.full_name field is not editable from a report. Therefore, include the Â incidents.assgn_acct_id field in the report if you want the Â Assigned value to be inline editable.   Columns using formulas: Â  If you include a formula in an output column that Â acts on a field, you Â cannot enable that field for inline editing. Â   Â  For example, if you use the formula: nvl(incidents.assgn_acct_id, 'No Assigned Account') to assign a display value for null values in the incident assigned field, that column cannot be enabled for inline editing. Â    Groupings: Â  Similarly, columns that group multiple records and report a summary value such as count, maximum, or minimum value cannot be enabled for inline editing. Â  If a row has any grouping in it, the field will not be able to be inline edited.

Responding to a survey or mailing email creates an incident;Answer ID 2607;How do we prevent incidents created from replies to low survey score notifications?;['Answer ID 385', 'Answer ID 551'];   Surveys, Mailings Outreach and Feedback Oracle B2C Service, All versions  Issue   We get notified via email if a survey score is at certain value. If someone replies to the email, it automatically creates a new incident. We do not want these incidents created.;"  When a survey email, or mailing from the Outreach/Feedback is replied to, it is sent back to the Reply-to address of the Outreach Mailbox specified on the Message tab. The techmail utility will then run against this mailbox and process any messages in the mailbox. If it finds a reply from a customer in the mailbox, it will create an incident in the Service side of the product. If you do not Â wish to have incidents created from replies to surveys or mailings, you will need to create an incident rule that will filter on the incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s source or incoming mailbox and then have an action to Do Not Create Incident. Â  For the best service to your customer you should send a response giving them instructions on how to get support. Follow the example below:  1. Create a standard text called ""Incident not created"" with instructions on how the customer can reach your support team using the web, email or chat. 2. Create a rule in the beginning of the default incident rule state called ""Do not create incidents from mailings"". 3. Add Â conditions and actions as follow:  If Incident.Incoming Mailbox equals &lt;enter the name of a specific Outreach mailbox&gt; alternately Incident.Source equals Utilities/Techmail - Â Outreach Mailbox Then 1. Append Response Template to Response Field (select the ""Incident not created"" standard text). 2. Send Email Response to Sender. Leave ""Incident Details"" unchecked. 3. Do Not Create Incident  4.

Finding a specific rule in the overall list;Answer ID 2608;How can I locate a specific rule?;['Answer ID 385', 'Answer ID 551'];   Business Rules Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  When troubleshooting rules, the Â rule log lists the rules that act on a specific record. Â  However, if your site has a lot of rules, it can still be difficult to locate a specific rule of interest. With rules, you can use the Search feature to open a pop-up window to find specific text in the rule list. This allows you to quickly find a specific rule based on its name. To find a specific rule in your site, use the steps below:  Open the active ruleset for the record type of interest. For example, Â you can view the active Incident Â ruleset by selecting Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Rules. On the ribbon click the Incident button and then click the View Active button. Â  Â   Â  Click the Search button located above the rule tree.  Â  Or another option Â is to Press CTRL + f to open the Find window.  Â  Enter the rule name or part of the rule name Â and press Enter or click Find.  When troubleshooting rules, be sure you are reviewing the active ruleset. Â  The active ruleset is listed when you select View Active from the options listed for the rule type. Â  For example, with Â contact rules, you can view the active ruleset by selecting Â Common Configuration &gt; Rules &gt; Â Contact &gt; View Active."

Notifying staff of tasks due for completion;Answer ID 2609;When adding tasks for our staff, how can I enable a notification to be sent to the staff member indicating when the task is due?;['Answer ID 1842', 'Answer ID 2181', 'Answer ID 1854'];  Tasks, Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;" When you first assign a task to a staff member, that staff member receives a Task Assigned notification at the console. Â  The staff member can double click the notification to open the task record to see when the task is due. To notify staff of upcoming tasks that are already assigned to them, you can configure task escalation rules or create scheduled reports or alerts to be sent when a task meets specific criteria you define. Task escalation rules: Â  As with other record types, you can create a set of rules to apply specifically to your task records. Â  From the Configuration options, select Site Configuration &gt; Rules. Click the Tasks button on the ribbon. Click the Â Edit button on the ribbon to open the Â Task Rules editor. As with other rulesets, it is best practice to have at least two rule states -- an initial rule state and an existing rule state. Â  Escalation rules are most commonly added to the existing rule state. Â  A single rule can be added to the initial rule state to simply transition the state to the existing state and continue processing rules. Then, within the existing rule state, you can configure the two escalation rules. Â  The first rule defines when the task should be escalated; the second rule indicates the action to take when the task is escalated (send a notification). For example, to send a notification 24 Â  hours before the task is due, you can configure two rules as follows: Rule: Â Esc 24 hours prior to due date (chain rule) IF Tasks.Status not equals Completed AND Tasks.Escalation Level equals Unspecified THEN Escalate to Level: 24 hr notify (or whatever name you choose) - 1 day relative to Tasks.Planned Completion Date (1 day or 24 hours previous to the planned completion date) Ã¢Ë†Å¡ Revalidate Ã¢Ë†Å¡ Recalculate (Check the relative check box and check the Revalidate and Recalculate check boxes.) Rule: Â Esc send notification IF Task.Escalation Level = 24 hr notify AND Task.Previous Escalation Level not equals 24 hr notify THEN Send Escalation Notification to assignee with Subject Line ""24 Hour Task Completion Notice"" (Enable the To Assignee box and enter the text for the subject line of the notification email send to the staff member) With your task rules configured, activate the ruleset and test your rules. For more information on configuring rule sets, refer to Answer ID 1842: Overview of Rule Functionality. Â  For more information on escalation rules, refer to Answer ID 2181: Setting up Escalation Rules. Scheduled reports and alerts: Â  You can also create a custom report that lists the tasks assigned to the logged in staff member and then schedule reports to be send on a regular basis or create alerts to be sent when a task is within a specified time period of its planned completion date and time. For example, you can create a custom report that filters tasks by staff member (task_instances.assgn_acct_id) Â and status type (task_instances.status_type). Then, you can schedule the report to be sent at a specific frequency. You can also create a data exception based on the planned completion date and send an alert when tasks are within a set time frame of their planned completion date. For more information on configuring alerts, refer to Answer ID 1854: Using Alerts when Scheduling Report Subscriptions."

Linking to a pre-populated answer page in CP;Answer ID 2629;How do I create a link to a pre-populated answer page?;['Answer ID 633', 'Answer ID 411', 'Answer ID 4273'];  Customer Portal (CP) end-use page set Oracle B2C Service Issue  I would like to link to a list of public answers related to a specific product/category combination or the results based on searching for a specific phrase.;" In Â the Customer Portal end-user pages, the basic URL to link to the answer list page is: http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/answers/list To pre-populate fields so that the search results match specific criteria, you can add parameters to the base URL. Â  Additional parameters that can be added are listed below: /p/3,15 -- sets the Products fields to the products and sub-products with the numerical value listed. Â  In this case, the top-level product field is set to the product name that has an ID of 3 and the sub-product field is set to the value that has an ID of 15. Â   Â  To obtain the numerical value to use, open the Products table (from the Service Configuration items) and hover over the product name. Use a comma to separate subsequent values.  Â  Â  /c/8,25,42 -- sets the Categories fields Â to the categories and sub-categories that match the numerical values listed. In this case, three category levels are set with the top level corresponding to the category with a numerical ID of 8. The second and third level categories are set to the values with IDs of 25 and 42.  Â  To obtain the numerical value to use, open the Â Categories table (from the Service Configuration items) and hover over the Â category name. Use a comma to separate subsequent values.  Â  Â  kw/word or kw/word1%20word2 -- the kw parameters allows you to set keywords to be searched on when the page opens. Â  To include multiple words separated by a space, use %20 to represent the space. For example, kw/apple%20banana pre-populates the Search by Keyword field with apple banana. Notes: In Customer Portal framework 3.x.x (CPv3), it is possible to directly link to the sub-product/sub-category. In order for pre-populated answer lists to work correctly using the URL extensions the answers.map_prod_hierarchy and answers.map_cat_hierarchy filters are required in the report. The CP pages that call reports against the answers table without these filters will throw an error and the default answer list will display.  Example 1: Â  An example of a URL that links directly to a specific product and sub-product is of the form: http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/answers/list/p/5,21 where 5 and 21 are the numerical database IDs for the product and sub-product values. CPv3 - http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/answers/list/p/21  Example 2: Â  Similarly, to link to a list of answers that are returned for a keyword search on ""staff profile"", the URL Â is: http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/answers/list/kw/staff%20profile  Example 3: Â  To link to the answers that match a specific category and are returned on a keyword search for ""account"", the URL is: http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/answers/list/c/14/kw/account where 14 is the numerical database ID for the category of interest. Additionally when referencing the URL from non-rightnow pages, you should URL encode the commas (replace them with %2C) to ensure you don't run into browser errors. Â  Â This isn't required but highly recommended. For Example 1: http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/answers/list/p/5,21 becomes: http://interfacename.custhelp.com/app/answers/list/p/5%2C21 In addition, other answers in this knowledgebase address linking to answers and other pages: Answer ID 633: Linking to an Answer from Ouside of Oracle B2C Service Answer ID 411: Linking to an Answer from an Answer Within Oracle B2C Service Answer ID 4273: Customer Portal 'answers.special_settings' filter"

Cobrowsing with chat customers;Answer ID 2658;"What is ""cobrowsing"" and how do I use it with Chat customers?";['Answer ID 5168'];   Chat,Ã‚Â Cobrowse Oracle B2C Service;  Cobrowsing lets customers share their desktop with agents who are helping them on the telephone or during a chat session. Staff members can guide customers through web pages using their mouse or other pointing device to demonstrate actions. In effect, they take control of the customer's browser to show the customer how to complete an action. Cobrowse helps eliminate the confusion that can arise when giving instructions to customers through dialog or text. Cobrowse is also effective for assisting customers in filling out forms or completing a sale. Your Oracle B2C Service administrator must enable Cobrowse before you can use this feature with a customer. Â For further information on Cobrowse, refer to the Cobrowse Overview Â section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Using CSS in Mailings;Answer ID 2661;What is a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)?;['Answer ID 2684'];   Cascading style sheetsÃ‚Â  (CSS) Oracle B2C Service Outreach and Feedback;"  Cascading style sheets give a web author the ability to control the appearance and formatting of web pages. Â  Web pages were traditionally constructed with markup tags surrounding individual pieces of each Â page to control its appearance, but making changes to a page or a set of pages became very labor intensive as the author was forced to edit each individual markup tag. Â  Alternatively, CSS allows an author's changes to ""cascade"" through all the web pages that it governs, saving time and effort. When you create a mailing in Oracle B2C Service Outreach and Feedback, you can use CSS to control the appearance of Â the message. Â  However, you may find that Â some mailings Â have the CSS formatting stripped out or ignored, depending on the mail client Â or webmail service that your recipients use. Â  By using the proofing functionality built into the RightNow mailing tool, you can send your mailings to Â 'test' email accounts Â to see if the formatting appears differently than what your CSS specifies. For more information refer to Answer ID 2684: Outreach Mailings and Outlook 2007."

Re-Queuing a Chat session;Answer ID 2662;How do I create rules to requeue a Chat request afterÃ‚Â a certain amount of time?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Chat, Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;"  You can use rule states to requeue a Chat Request after a certain number of seconds. Let's suppose you would like a Chat assigned to queue A, and then if it is not answered for 60 seconds, re-assigned to queue B. Â  Â  You could create a chat rule state called ""Initial State"" and a state called ""Requeued Once."" In the initial state, make a rule called ""Initial Assign"" with the actions ""Assign the chat to queue A"" and another rule called ""Requeue in 60 seconds"" with the actions ""Requeue Chat request in 60 seconds"" and ""Transition to state 'Requeued Once' and stop."" In the state ""Requeued Once"" create a rule ""Assign to B"" with the action ""Assign Chat to Queue B."" This will assign the chat to Queue A and start a timer. If that timer expires and the Chat has not been picked up, the rules in the state ""Requeued Once"" will now fire, assigning the chat to Queue B. Note: Transition to State and Stop action means that the record is transitioned to the state but is not compared to any rules in that state, however chat rules work a bit differently in this case. Chat rules will only compare a chat with rules that assign it to a different queue in order for re-queuing Â to work. However, other rules defined in that particular state (Requeued State) will not be triggered. Here Â are the example rules: Initial State: Rule 1: Assign Chat to Queue A Rule 2: Requeue Chat request in 60 seconds, Transition to state ""Requeued Once"" and stop Requeued Once State: Rule 1: Assign Chat to Queue B You can optionally create further states if you want further handling to occur if the incident is not answered in Queue B.  For additional information, refer to the 'Actions for chat rules' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Language setting for incidents received via Techmail;Answer ID 2663;How is the language setting determined for incidents that are created via incoming techmail?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Foreign Language, Email; For an incident created by techmail: Â   The language ID is set by language-detection software that uses the content from the message body and/or subject line. The language ID is set only if an interface of that language pack exists within your site. If language cannot be determined from the content or subject, then the language id is set to the language of the interface for the mailbox to which it was sent. Incidents generated for techmail processing errors will have the language id set to match that of the current interface. The interface for the resulting incident is not changed to match the interface where that language exists. If desired, create business rules to set the interface for these incidents to different values. The behavior for incoming emails and languages within the application functions as follows. Process message based on encoding which defines the language family. For example, ISO-8859-1 would be European language including English. Review the decoded text to identify the specific language, for example Dutch. Assign incident to interface of mailbox. Assign incident to language of email IF an interface of that language exists. In this case, the language would be English or Dutch if the incoming message is English or Dutch and the site has an English and Dutch interface. Assign incident language to the language of the interface for the mailbox to which it was sent.  For incidents created via other methods:  If other incidents are created with no language specification, you can use Workspace rules if desired. Language can't be set in Business Rules. Example workspace rules are below. Note: Set Language is not a conditional choice in Business Rules. An example of an incident work space rule, could be something like the following based on a site with English and Dutch interfaces.  Apply this rule when the editor loads. But only if interface = English interface Â and the language is not English or No Value Then set language to English.  A second work space rule could manage all the rest of the interfaces and set the value to Dutch if the language is Not Dutch or No Value. In using Work Space rules, the language is not set at incident creation but the first time the incident is edited. The behavior for End User Questions is as follows.   Assign incident to interface of Question page Assign incident to language of interface  Another option to manually set the language of incidents, would be to add the language field to the Incident Multi-Edit work space. Â  Â Then create a report which filters your incidents similar to the rules above. Â  Â Then you could multi-select and change the language.

Branching survey questions;Answer ID 2664;Can I create a survey that branches based on user input?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Outreach and Feedback Oracle B2C Service;"  It is possible to Â create a branching survey. Â  The following Â provides a basic overview of steps needed to accomplish this. 1. Â  Â From the Survey Explorer, create a new survey 2. Â  Â Switch to advanced mode from the Survey Tasks listing on the right 3. Â  Â Make sure you have at least two pages to branch to; for example, one for a ""yes"" entry, and another if the user selects ""no"". 4. Â  Â Add a decision element from the Survey Components toolbox. Â  Â Right-click the component and select ""Edit Properties"" to select the conditions that correspond to the logic of your survey. 5. Â  Â From the decision element, you can use the connectors, located in the Connectors box on the right, most appropriate to link to the subsequent pages in the survey. Â  Â In our example, we would use a green ""yes"" connector and a red ""no"" connector so that a user would be directed to different questions based on their answer to the first question. A very basic illustration is as follows:      For more information on surveys, refer to the Outreach and Feedback section in the documentation for your version.

Mailings and surveys using replication server;Answer ID 2665;How do I know mailings sent through the replication server are being sent correctly and on time?;['Answer ID 5609'];   Outreach, Feedback, Surveys, Mailings, Campaigns;  Mailings and surveys with a high volume audience will use the replication server to reduce the impact of large processes on the production database. Because the synchronization between the replication server and the production server can occasionally fall behind, the mailer daemon uses a failsafe function before sending to ensure that the replication server is caught up. If it is not, the mailing or survey will be delayed until the replication server has been synchronized. This failsafe system Â ensures the mailing or survey will reflect the current state of your production contact records (including their opt-in/opt-out and valid/invalid statuses) at the time the mailing or survey is sent. This function is similar to what is used with Analytics Reports when using the operational or reporting server to run reports. Please see Answer 5609: Information on different database types used for reporting Â for more information. Although you can manually change which server runs for reports, the failsafe system ensures the best data source will be used when generating an outgoing email for an Outreach product. There is functionality to use the operational data source when a mailing or survey is generated on a small site and small audience. This is dependent on the audience generated and how the selection is optimized. If you are uncertain whether your site uses the replication server to send mailings and surveys, please contact Oracle B2C Service Technical Support or your account representative.

Differing numbers of file attachments on answers;Answer ID 2666;Why do I have more attachments on an answer on the end user pages than I have in the attachments tab on the answer console?;['Answer ID 2483', 'Answer ID 2518'];   Attachments to published answers Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  The reason that the end user answer has more attachments on the end user page than you can see in the answer console is due to a missing element in the answer workspace you are using. The attachments tab in the answers workspace can be configured in such a way that you can attach two categories of attachments:  - Attachments for this answer (default) - Attachments for this answer and all sibling answers (not enabled by default)  To see all attachments that are associated to an answer and its siblings you will need to enable Â the ability to see the ""Attachments for this answer and all sibling answers"" sections within the workspace you are using. The answer workspace can be found Â under the Â Interfaces section Â of your profile. If you are using a default workspace it will need to be copied before you can edit it as the default workspaces are read only. For more information on copying a workspace, refer to Â Answer 2483: Setting up a new workspace. Once you have an editable workspace, you can add the ""Attachments for this answer and all sibling answers"" sections within the attachments tab of the workspace as follows:  1) Click on Attachments tab 2) Click on attachments object in the body of the attachments tab 3) From the Design ribbon &gt; Options section, set the ""Siblings Visible"" property to ""True"" 4) Note that the attachments object in the body of the tab is now split and has a ""Attachments for this answers and all sibling answers"" section. 5) Save and close the workspace.  All agents using profiles that you associate the modified workspace to will have to log out and back into the console Â to see this change.  Now when adding attachments, you can see you have two options for adding attachments. You should now be able to see the extra attachments in the answer console in the ""Attachments for this answer and all sibling answers"" sections of the workspace that were previously only visible on the end user pages.  For more information on setting up a workspace, refer to Answer 2518: Setting properties in workspaces."

Default character encodings for outgoing email;Answer ID 2668;What is the default character encoding for outgoing Service email, and how doesÃ‚Â it impact my customers?;['Answer ID 2483', 'Answer ID 2518'];   Oracle B2C Service, All versions - Interfaces / Languages;  Each interface is language specific. Â  Â Therefore, the outgoing email character encoding default is Â language specific. Â  Â  The Service outgoing email encoding utilized is as follows: (1) For Service, the interface encoding for the assigned interface of the incident, not the interface logged into. (2) For Service, forwarded email encoding Â is the encoding of the interface logged into. For example, an agent is logged into an English interface configured to Â use the UTF-8 encoding. Â  The agent is working an incident associated to the Japanese interface configured to use the ISO-2022-JP encoding. Â  The incident response will use the Japanese interface encoding. Â  If the incident is forwarded while logged into the English interface, the English interface encoding UTF-8 will be used for the forwarded email.  The following table identifies the language group and the default character encoding. Â  Â As an example, a French interface (Western European language) would have an outgoing email encoding of UTF-8. Â        Language      Character Encoding           Western Europe      UTF-8         Western and Central Europe      ISO-8859-2         Cyrillic (e.g., Russian) *      ISO-8859-5         Greek      ISO-8859-7         Japanese      ISO-2022-JP         Simplified Chinese - Mainland China      GB2312         Traditional Chinese - Hong Kong      Big5         Traditional Chinese - Taiwan      Big5         Korean      ISO-2022-KR             Arabic      ISO-8859-6  When multiple languages are used with Arabic,  UTF-8 should be used.      By default, outgoing email is NOT configured as a universal encoding except for Western European starting with the August 2010 version. The character encoding UTF-8 is the most universal encoding. Â  Â However, some characters may still not display correctly depending on the recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s email client as not all email clients support Â it. Note: Â  Outlook 2013 for Japanese appears to Â only support EUC, SHIFT-JIS, Â and UTF-8 Â encoding but NOT Â ISO-2022-JP. Â  Outgoing email may have garbled characters. If customer base or agent base is using Outlook 2013 the outgoing encoding may need to be changed for consistency. It is recommended to use UTF-8 if a change is required to make across interface incident handling consistent. Before deciding to change the Â character encoding to UTF-8, evaluate your customer base for the interface and/or language to determine if the change is appropriate to that customer base. Â  Â The recommendation is for the Agent to use the interface of the language of the customer base. Â  Â  To change the outgoing email encoding for an interface, you will Â need to submit an incident requesting a change in the outgoing email character encoding. Â  Â The specific site and interface are required to confirm the change.

Â  Â Because many items are workspace driven and specific to accounts/profiles, it is best that we clone the account experiencing the issue. Â  Â This gives us an exact replica of the profile permissions and staff account workspaces to investigate. Â  Â All work done by Technical Support through one of these cloned accounts is logged for security purposes. Generally, once we are done troubleshooting an issue, we will remove the cloned account. Â  Â However, in some cases it is necessary to let the account remain for escalation purposes. Â  Oracle uses these cloned accounts as a tool to help resolve service requests submitted by your organization. Â  Â Submission of a service request provides Oracle permission to create a cloned account and login to your site for investigation of reported issues. Â  Â As part of your contract, you agree to provide Oracle with all necessary information, access and full good faith cooperation reasonably necessary to enable Oracle to provide Support Services. Under the cloned account, Technical Support will attempt to reproduce the reported issue and/or diagnose unexpected behavior. Â  Â They will not make configuration or environmental changes within the application. Â  Â If such changes are needed, they will be communicated to you via the service request and instructions provided for you to make changes within your site. When you see these accounts, it is not necessary that you adjust the permissions or disable these accounts, as they may be in use for troubleshooting and are only temporary.

Modifications to the HTML source of documents;Answer ID 2673;Why does theÃ‚Â HTML source of my document get reformatted when I save or toggle between source and design modes?;['Answer ID 2483', 'Answer ID 2518'];   HTML Document Editor Answers, Mailings, Documents,Ã‚Â All versions;"  The reason you may see changes in html formatting is due to the use of a utility called Tidy. Â  It is not possible to disable Tidy in the Oracle B2C Service application. In versions 18A+ HTML is able to be saved directly from Source mode in the answer editor. In these versions Tidy is still used however when toggling between Design and Source mode. For example when an agent switches modes from Source -&gt; Design -&gt; Source, Tidy will perform the reformatting. Â  Documents in Oracle B2C Service are stored as XHTML, which is an HTML/XML (Ã¢â‚¬Å“eXtensible Markup LanguageÃ¢â‚¬Â) hybrid. The HTML heritage of XHTML documents allows the use of standard markup tags to specify how documents should be presented in an end-userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s browser. Its XML heritage Â affords the ability to define the custom tags from which Outreach and Feedback derive most of their power and utility. Reliably storing and processing these documents is much more straightforward with XHTML as opposed to using plain HTML. As an XML document, an XHTML document must meet a stricter set of requirements than HTML documents do. The way we ensure that documents are XML-compliant is by running them through the utility Â Tidy, a de facto industry standard software tool that cleans up HTML and offers a conversion into XHTML. A partial list of modifications that Tidy makes in the HTML-to-XHTML conversion process follows: 1. Â  It adds a DOCTYPE declaration, which indicates which XHTML specification the document uses. Three XHTML specifications are available: strict, transitional, and frameset. When a fresh document is created from Â the HTML editor, the DOCTYPE defaults to XHTML strict. If HTML is copied-and-pasted into the HTML editor's source mode, the DOCTYPE defaults to XHTML transitional. Oracle B2C Service does not Â use the frameset DOCTYPE. 2. Â  It makes sure that Â tags are properly closed, when necessary. For example, when a new paragraph is opened with the &lt;p&gt;, it must be closed with &lt;/p&gt;. Â  Â Web browsers are Â forgiving Â when closing tags are omitted, and will make best guesses as to what the document author intended. XML, on the other hand, is more stringent Â by requiring that all tags be closed. 3. Â  It forces all tags into lower case. HTML is case-insensitive and treats &lt;p&gt; and &lt;P&gt; as the same tag. Alternatively, XML is case sensitive Â and will not allow Â a &lt;p&gt; tag used with &lt;/P&gt;. There are three times that Oracle B2C Service runs Tidy on a document: when the user switches from design to source mode (or vice-versa), when a document is saved, and when a parse error is detected. In the case of parse errors, the editor brings up Â a dialog window that highlights Â any problem: Clicking on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“CloseÃ¢â‚¬Â button simply dismisses the dialog. Clicking Â the Ã¢â‚¬Å“RepairÃ¢â‚¬Â button runs Tidy on the XHTML source code so that it parses successfully. In this case, repairing the document will change the erroneous &lt;/P&gt; tag to &lt;/p&gt; so that it correctly closes the opening &lt;p&gt;. Â   NOTE: If a particular Message Template does not use the Global Template, when the user switches from source mode to design mode and back, the following code will be added and wrapped arround the existing source code of the message template:  &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN""  Â  Â  Â  Â ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt; &lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" xmlns:rn=""http://schemas.rightnow.com/crm/document"" lang=""en""&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8"" /&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body style=""background-color: #FFF;""&gt; Existing source code of the message template &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;  To apply or remove the global template to a specific message template, toggle the Template button on the ribbon while the particular Message Template is open for editing. If the Global Template is applied to the Message template, the above piece of code is removed, because the code is already included in the Global Template. There are times when Tidy will not be able to repair a document. For example, Tidy is generally unable to insert namespace declarations that support custom tags. Names of Oracle B2C Service custom tags are prefixed with Ã¢â‚¬Å“rn:Ã¢â‚¬Â, and are supported by the namespace declaration xmlns:rn=""http://schemas.rightnow.com/crm/documentÃ¢â‚¬Â. This declaration is an attribute of the &lt;html&gt; element, and tells the parser that tags bearing an Ã¢â‚¬Å“rnÃ¢â‚¬Â prefix need to meet the requirements found at http://schemas.rightnow.com/crm/document. If itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s missing, an XML parse error will result. In this case, asking Tidy to repair the document Â is Â ineffective, Â since it has no idea how to resolve an Ã¢â‚¬Å“rnÃ¢â‚¬Â-prefixed tag. Missing namespace declarations need to be fixed manually, in this case by changing the &lt;html&gt; declaration to read  &lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" xmlns:rn=""http://schemas.rightnow.com/crm/document""&gt;  Related Configuration Settings HTML_TIDY_BLOCK_TAGS - Specifies new block-level tags. This option takes a space or comma separated list of tag names. Unless new tags are declared, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if the input includes previously unknown tags. Note: The content model for elements such as &lt;TABLE&gt;, &lt;UL&gt;, &lt;OL&gt; and &lt;DL&gt; cannot be changed. Default is blank.  HTML_TIDY_EMPTY_TAGS - Specifies new empty inline tags. This option takes a space or comma separated list of tag names. Unless new tags are declared, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if the input includes previously unknown tags. Empty tags must also be declared as either inline or block-level. Default is blank.  HTML_TIDY_ENFORCE_XHTML - Specifies whether content in HTML editors must meet XHTML compliance.

Gaps and out of order sequence for incident reference numbers;Answer ID 2679;Why do incident reference numbers contain gaps and not adhere to incident creation order?;['Answer ID 2460']; Ã‚Â Ã‚Â   Incident Reference Numbers Note  Similar gaps are possible in all record types (i.e. answers, contacts, organizations, etc.).;  When the creation of a new incident is started, a unique reference number is attached to the record before the incident is saved.  Â For efficiency, the Browser User Interface (BUI) will also Ã¢â‚¬Å“pre-fetchÃ¢â‚¬Â reference numbers for each agent that is logged in. Â  This ensures a reference number is immediately available to attach to a new record when an agent decides to take this action. This reference number will not be reused should the author start to create an incident then decide not to save this new incident.  Â Pre-fetched values will not be reused if the agent never ends up creating an incident.  Â The application does not adjust the sequence of incident reference numbers to eliminate breaks in the sequence or to ensure the order matches creation order. This does not affect reporting as reports concerning incidents only take into account the incidents that were created and subsequently saved as active records. Â  Oracle B2C Service also assigns an incident i_id number to each incident during the initial save.  Â If you are reviewing incidents to establish order of creation or to ensure there are no gaps/deleted incident records, you should utilize this ID number instead of the reference number.  Â  The deleted records table also allows you to view any records that may have been manually deleted from the application.  Â For more information regarding this option, please see Answer ID 2460: Determining who deleted records from the application.

This is why a web form will not work within a mailing. The following are other limitations:  No support for animated gifs No support for Flash or other plug-ins No support for CSS Floats/Positioning No support for using images as bullet in unordered lists No support for background images No support for forms Limited support for background color Alt tags will be modified  Outlook 2007 is purposefully designed to not render webform fields and buttons inside a web form for delivered email. Furthermore, there are a number of email clients that do not allow webform submission: Gmail, Hotmail, Thunderbird, Windows Mail, Pegasus 4.41 (errors on submit), Eudora 7.1.  If you would like to use any of the above listed HTML you can generate and email a link to a URL for the document that you would have normally emailed. To do this you will need to create a document, a campaign, and a mailing:  Create a document that contains the content that would have previously been included in the email. Enable the document for both email and web.  Â  Create a campaign: Add a ""Serve Web Page"" to the campaign. update the properties of the serve web page to include the document you created above. Copy the URL of the serve web page. Set the status of the campaign to ""launched"". Save and close the campaign.  Â  Create a mailing to distribute the URL for the campaign.  Â  Send the mailing.   Â  By following these instructions, you will be able to continue to deliver mailings and information to your customers, but you will avoid the problem created by various email clients that no longer allow webform submission via email. Best Principles For Bulletproof Newsletter Delivery Since newsletters are still an important part of marketing campaigns, to achieve the highest response rate you'd like to ensure the highest delivery rate. The principles and rules listed below might help you to increase the delivery rate of your newsletters.  Send newsletters regularly. Tuesday / Wednesday 2-3pm = Increased Response. Slow down your newsletter delivery. Use a tag line at the beginning of the subject line. Always insert the current date in the content. HTML is OK, but only if MIME-Multipart is used. Use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) sparingly. Avoid graphics and complex HTML-elements. Spam-filters consider a number of issues related to HTML. For instance, if the newsletter has too many closed tags, too many graphic (images) or structural (tables) elements it gets just as many spam score points. Besides, many readers use software (e.g. Outlook) which automatically blocks images; if users don't understand what the mail is about they'll report is as spam. Complex HTML (particularly if more than 50% of HTML-code are HTML-tags) is generously awarded with many spam score points Ã¢â‚¬â€ keep it simple. Colorful backgrounds, tables, JavaScripts and web forms shouldn't be in newsletters. Motivate your users to add you to their whitelists.. Screen your advertisers and partners. Monitor new subscribers. Verify your subscribers with signup confirmation. Test your newsletters before sending them out.   "

Using the Answer Workspace;Answer ID 2685;How do I use the standard answer workspace?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle B2C Service, Standard answer workspace;  The Â answer workspace Â allows access to answers used with your end-user pages. Staff profiles determine whether a staff member can access and publish answers.

Using report variables in Analytics;Answer ID 2689;What are report variables and how do they work?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Variables used in Analytics Oracle B2C Service;"  Variables can be used in report output columns and data exceptions. Â  Â Using a variable in an output column allows different data to be returned or data in different formats in the same column. Â  Â For example, a single report can be created that displays the number of incidents by a staff member, group, queue, or status. Â  Â One of these four values can be used as a variable in the report and can be selected from the Search window or from a menu at the top of the report if the variable is docked. For example, the following variable can be used to group data together based on a specific time interval: date_group(incidents.created, $date_grp_param) When using the above variable, a ""Date Grouping"" menu listing various units of time will appear in the report's Search window, so the report can be run showing different date groupings per the date range selected (e.g. Year/Month/Day, Year/Week, etc.). Â  Â Please note that you need to have some type of date range filter using the same date field in place for this variable to work properly; for example, ""incidents.created BETWEEN -1 Weeks to 0 Weeks"". Using a variable in a data exception allows a single exception to flag different data. Â  Â This eliminates the need to create multiple exceptions to flag data in different columns. Â  Â For example, a variable could be used in an exception to flag incidents that were created more than one day ago, or to flag incidents that were updated more than one day ago. Â  Â The information you want to flag is selected on the Search window when the report is generated. Before variables can be used in output columns or data exceptions, the variables first need to be created. Â  Â There are several types of variables that can be used, including pre-defined lists, user-defined lists, ad-hoc values, and replacement values. Â  Â Each of these serves a unique function. Once a variable is created in a report, it is added to the variables list in the report design center's data dictionary. Â  Â Output columns can be created that use the variable in the same fashion as any other output column, creating the column's expression from database fields, functions, computed fields, and variables listed in the data dictionary. Â  Â In some cases, the variable will be the only item in the column's expression. Â  Â In other cases, the variable will be combined with functions or database fields to form the column's expression. When a pre-defined list, user-defined list, or ad-hoc variable is included in a report's output columns, a menu listing the variable's options will display on the report's Search window. Â  Â The variable menu can also display at the top of the report in the docked filters section for easy access by individuals using the report. For additional examples and information regarding variables, refer to the 'Variables' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

At the top of the workspace editor, click the 'Search Report' button to see which report is being used Â in conjunction with this Â search. (Standard report is ID 125, ""Search KnowledgeBase"") Once you determine which report is being used, locate the report in Reports Explorer and edit it to meet your search needs. If the report in question is Â a standard report that cannot be edited, then you will need to make a copy of the report and customize it instead. Â You will then need to edit the workspace again to use the new customized report. Please note that while it is possible to customize the report being used by changing columns, it is not possible to alter the Action links used. For example, additional action link cannot be added, not existing ones removed. Â  When run via the Search Knowledgebase feature from the incident editor, either all or none of the following three action links will be displayed, depending on how the report is configured:  Â  Â  Â  Â Add as Link  Â  Â  Â  Â Add as Text  Â  Â  Â  Â View To configure if the action links are to be displayed or not, edit the report and click the 'Records' button on the Ribbon, in the Properties section on the Home tab: - to display all the three actions, expand 'Answer' and select all checkboxes - to display none of the three actions, uncheck all checkboxes. Please note that even if all the checkboxes are selected, when the report is run inside the Search Knowledgebase feature in the workspace, the users will only be allowed to View Link, Add as Text and View the answers returned by the report. The other options such as Delete, New, etc. will not be displayed when the user right-clicks an answer returned by the Search Knowledgebase feature. In the scenario where the agents need to use the report both standalone and inside the Search Knowledgebase feature, and they should see the action links in the Search Knowledge but should have fewer commands in the standalone report (such as Print, but not Delete), please consider using two distinct reports. See Answer 5282: Search KnowledgeBase Report - Read Only for more details on configuring the standalone report."

Agent Scripting;Answer ID 2695;What is Agent Scripting and how do I enable and use it?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Agent Console Oracle B2C Service;  Agent scripts in Oracle B2C Service add powerful functionality to workspaces and workflows, leading staff members through a series of pages to help them enter information in a logical progression. Script pages can contain most fields and controls available to workspaces, with the exception of relationship items. They can also include questions and branching logic, similar to guides, so you can create wizards to guide staff members to different pages based on the information entered or actions taken on a previous page. Agent scripting provides your staff with a methodical, efficient interface for capturing information and resolving issues. Scripts are created from the scripts designer which is also similar to the workspace designer, but which includes options to add pages and create branches. Once you create a script, you can place it on a workspace using the Script workspace control, which you access from the workspace designerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Insert Control tab. Â Note: the agent's profile must have permission in order to add scripts. Agent scripting does inherit workspace permissions. Note: The Agent scripting feature must be enabled. Contact your Oracle account manager for entitlement of this feature.

Â  Â An incident is automatically created to notify your primary support contact and Â Oracle B2C Service Technical Support Â that a utility has been suspended and requires investigation as Â to the cause. The utility will not run again until it has been removed from the No-Utility status. Â  Â  An investigation will Â take place to determine the cause of the error and the incident will be continually updated to:  identify the issue inform you of any workarounds put in place alert you that the utility has Â been re-enabled and is running without error.  The severity of a suspended utility varies with each customer's business practices. Â  Â For example the suspension of the techmail utility, which processes incoming email, may be a high severity to some customers and of no business importance to others. Â  Â  Although Hosting Auto-Notification incidents are set to a severity level of 3, customers can and should change the severity if their business practices warrant a change. Â  By process we treat all Hosting Auto-Notification incidents internally as severity 2. Â  Â We also treat incidents for some utilities, such as techmail-s and dbstatus-r, with higher urgency than others. The following summarizes impacts you may observe when a utility is suspended from running. Agedatabase:  Service Performance and Service Summary reporting data is not cached. Â  Â  Â This means that data accumulated since the last successful agedatabase run will not be available in reports. Automatic closure of incidents does not occur.

Â  New Features and Benefits There are many dynamic challenges faced in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s email deliverability landscape, Â and the Â email platform will help meet the growing demands of you our customers. With the capacity of delivering millions of messages per hour, Â Oracle Â Service Cloud Â provides a Â scalable Â outbound mail infrastructure. Newer versions of Oracle B2C Service allow messages to be processed as they come into the mailbox. See Â Answer ID 8745: What is Techmail On Demand? for more information. Configurable and dynamic rate limiting allows Oracle to monitor and fine tune delivery behavior on an ISP basis. Email for all customers using an Oracle-supplied Ã¢â‚¬Å“From:Ã¢â‚¬Â address Â is DomainKeys and DKIM signed without further customer action. This Â allows ISPs such as Yahoo, AOL, and Gmail to authenticate all incoming email for your incident responses. Additionally, customers that wish to brand their mail Ã¢â‚¬Å“From:Ã¢â‚¬Â address with their own domain can submit an incident and get their email DK/DKIM signed as well. Provides enhanced bounce handling, analysis and categorization, allowing Â Oracle to more quickly respond to the rapidly changing email delivery landscape. Allows flexibility and scalability for future demands in email deliverability. Up to 25GB file size allowance for hosted mailboxes/pop accounts. Â  See Answer ID 280: Maximum size of file attachments Â for more information.

DKIM email authentication configuration;Answer ID 2701;What is DKIM email authentication configuration?;['Answer ID 8745', 'Answer ID 280', 'Answer ID 2489', 'Answer ID 2701'];   DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), Email authentication Oracle B2C Service;"  DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an email authentication technologies designed to identify legitimate senders of email. DKIM is a cryptographic signature that is generated from selected header and body components of an email. That cryptographic signature is then validated against published DNS information for your organization. Oracle B2C Service supports DKIM for all outbound email (Service and Outreach). If you use an Oracle-supplied email addresses, either custhelp.com or rnmk.com, for your Friendly From/Branded Address, no further action is needed. Oracle B2C Service already signs these emails. Because DKIM allows domain-based reputation lists to be built, we strongly recommend using your own domain name in the Friendly From/Branded Address. To enable DKIM for your outbound email using your organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s domain name in the Friendly From/Branded Address field, use the following checklist:  Submit a service request for this information Â requesting DKIM signing. Specify the email address you intend on using as the Â Friendly From/Branded Address in your mailings.   Oracle Â will generate a public-private key pair for use in signing these messages, and will generate a unique selector that will be used for signing your messages, and will update the incident with the selector in a form suitable for use with BIND DNS servers.   Your organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s IT administrators must add this selector within the domain desired to be signed. If your IT department uses a DNS infrastructure other than BIND, they must consult their documentation or vendors on the appropriate form to be used. Update the incident when this step has been completed.   Oracle Â will verify that your DNS is updated correctly, and that the published selector in your domain validates against DKIM standards.   Oracle Â will configure our mail servers to sign messages matching the domain name portion of your Ã¢â‚¬Å“From:Ã¢â‚¬Â address, and will close the incident after testing. Subsequently, all your email using that domain name delivered from our hosting environment will contain a Â DKIM signature.  Example: You are in charge of marketing and support services for your organization WidgetsRUs, using the domainname Ã¢â‚¬Å“widgetsrus.comÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Submit a service request for this information: Ã¢â‚¬ËœWe would like to sign with DKIM  Â for all emails using a Ã¢â‚¬Å“From:Ã¢â‚¬Â header of Ã¢â‚¬Å“someemail@widgetsrus.comÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬â„¢   Oracle Â generates a public-private key and a unique selector, called Ã¢â‚¬Å“dkimrnt012345Ã¢â‚¬Â. We update the incident with the following records suitable for publishing within your domain (these records should all be on one line; no spaces are permitted in the public key [p=] portion):  dkimrnt012345._domainkey.widgetsrus.com. IN  Â   Â  TXT  Â   Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“v=DKIM1; k=rsa; h=sha; p=MIGÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦QABÃ¢â‚¬Â   Oracle receives your confirmation that the selectors have been published. Oracle verifies the validity of these published selectors. Oracle configures our mail servers to sign all messages using an email address containing a domain name portion of Ã¢â‚¬Å“widgetsrus.comÃ¢â‚¬Â. We verify that these signatures are being added and are validating against your DNS, and update and close the incident with our results.  For additional information, see the following standards and documentation: http://www.dkim.org Â  -  Â DKIM working group http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail Â  -  Â Summary of DKIM http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4871 Â  -  Â Standards for DKIM"

Once the answer is automatically published, the Publish On date is cleared. Â   For more information on this feature, refer to Answer ID 1999: Automatically publishing answers on a specific date.  To help illustrate, let's say we have an answer set with the details below:  The answer was Â created on Â 1/1/2018 The Publish On date Â was set to Â 2/15/2018 The answer is manually set to Public on 1/28/2018 Â (Publish On date remains set to 2/15/2018) The answer is then set to a Private status type on 7/1/2018, but the 2/15/2018 Â Publish On date is not manually cleared. RESULT: The answer will auto-publish the next time the agedatabase utility runs (7/1 or 7/2), because the 2/15/2018 Â Publish On date is less than or equal to the current date. Â  Â The Publish On date is then automatically cleared by the agedatabase utility. Â  Â The agedatabase utility generally runs nightly around midnight.  For this reason, you will want to ensure the Publish On field is visible within each agent's workspace who edits answers so agents can clear the field when needed. You can Â create a report that lists all answers published by the agedatabase utility. Â  Â The report's configuration would be similar to the following: - Filter: Â  Â transactions.source_hierarchy &gt;&gt; ""in list"" &gt;&gt; select Utilities &gt; Agedatabase - Answer Publish - Output fields: fields of your choice, for example: Answers &gt; Answer ID Transactions &gt; Date Created (this will give you the date/time the answer was published).

Using wildcards in domain names in security configuration settings;Answer ID 2709;How should I use wildcards so as to not affect network efficiency?;['Answer ID 1960'];  Using wildcards in domain names within configuration settings; While several configuration strings in the Oracle B2C Service application allow for wildcards in the domain names, it is important to use them carefully in order to maintain peak network efficiency. When a login is being processed, if the first string encountered Â is a wildcarded domain name (or a fully-qualified domain name) then Â the application Â will Â perform a Â reverse DNS lookup against that domain name to see if the IP is coming from the domain. Â  Â This can add as many as 10 seconds to round trip times and adversely affect the ability of Â agents that are geographically separate from the hosting pod. Â  Â  Â  The best practice in this case Â would be Â to add the hard-coded IP addresses first, domain names next, and the wildcarded domain names last. Â  Â It is preferable as well, to use as few domain names as possible, and hard coded IPs whenever feasible. For more information about the security configurations affected by these strings, refer to your site's System Configuration settings.

"""Total Clicked"" and ""Total Opened"" in mailings";Answer ID 2714;When I view the results of my mailing, I see different results for 'Clicked' and 'Total Clicked' and also 'Opened' and 'Total Opened'.Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 5168'];   Click-through Results Oracle B2C Service, Outreach and Feedback, Mailings;  The total number of clicks refers to the total number of times a person or persons click on the link to your survey within the mailing. Â  Â So, if Person A clicks on the link to your survey four separate times, and Person B clicks on the link to the survey three separate times, then the Total Clicks = 7, and Clicks = 2. Â  Â Essentially, total clicks = total number of clicks and clicked = the number of unique clicks (or the number of individuals that clicked on your survey link). The same theory can be used for Total Opened vs. Opened, but this statistic refers to the number of times your email (containing the link to the survey) was opened. Â  Â So, if Person A opens the email eight times, and Person B opens the email seven times, then Total Opened = 15, and Opened = 2. Note: In the standard Tracked Link Activity report, these are labeled 'Total Clicks' and 'Unique Clicks' to help distinguish the difference.

Assigning SLAs using rules;Answer ID 2775;If an SLA would be applied by default to an incident, could a rule reapply the SLA?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Service Level Agreements (SLA); By design, if Â the default Â SLA would be applied to an incident, rules will not reapply this SLA to the Â incident. This can cause some counter intuitive situations if rules are assigning multiple SLAs to a single incident. Therefore, it is considered a best practice to only assign one SLA to an incident via rules. Good Example: Rule 1: If organization.country = US and Severity = 2,3 or 4, then assign SLA 2. Rule 2: If organization.country = US and Severity = 1, then assign SLA 1. Bad Example: Rule 1: Assign SLA 2. Rule 2: If organization.country = US and Severity = 1, then assign SLA 1. Although these rules may appear to accomplish the same objective, if an incident would by default have SLA 1 applied to it, the Bad Rules example will assign the incident SLA 2, since rules will not reapply SLA 1 to the incident.

Common questions regarding queued reports;Answer ID 2776;What is a Queued Report andÃ‚Â how do I useÃ‚Â them?;['Answer ID 1835', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Queued Reports;"  Reports may require a great deal of time to run depending on the amount of data that they search and subsequently return. Â To help you better manage reports which operate on large data sets, there is an option to queue reports. Report queuing allows you to begin running a report and come back later to receive the results. Note: Once a report has been designated to run as a queued Â report, all future runs of that report will run in a queued fashion until a user edits the report and changes it to run immediately.  Using Queued Reports:  If you would like to manually queue a report, simply right click on the report and choose Ã¢â‚¬Å“Queue.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Reports which take a long time to return data will automatically present you with the option to queue the report. If your report exceeds a configured time limit (default is 60 seconds) Â to return data, or if the results exceed a configured size limit for the data set, you will be presented with a message allowing you to queue the report:  Once you have chosen to queue the report, you will be asked for the parameters to run the queued report with.  Once the parameters are selected, you will be presented with an estimate of the time it will take to run the query.  Once the report is ready you will receive a notification if they are enabled. For more information on Notifications, please see Answer ID 1835: Staff notifications and email sent to staff.  Pop up or Toast Notification:  You can view your notifications:  You can right-click on the row in the notification and select Open &gt; Queued Report to open the report:  The report data is then displayed:   You can also open queued reports using the Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Queued ReportsÃ¢â‚¬Â report, which is a standard report found in Common &gt; Site Administration &gt; Reports &gt; My Queued Reports:    You can right-click on a row and select Ã¢â‚¬Å“OpenÃ¢â‚¬Â to open the queued report:  Â   Other notes on queued reports  Keep in mind that when you open a queued report, you are looking at a stored snapshot of the data. If changes happen to the data after it has been stored, you will need to run the report again to see those changes. If your site is configured to use the replication server, please keep the following considerations in mind when running and queuing reports:  Any reports you queue will automatically run on the report server unless the report is always configured to run on the production server. Â  Â You can configure this option by editing the report and selecting Home tab &gt; Options drop-down &gt; More optionsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ &gt; Data Source option: Â  Â Report Database or Operational (production) database.   When you attempt to run a report, the Oracle B2C Service application checks the database query generated by the report. Â  Â If it is determined the query will take longer than ten seconds to run, the report will run on the report server unless the report is configured to run on the production server. Â  Â If the query will take longer than sixty seconds to run, you will be given the option to queue the report or run the report again using different search parameters.   If your report has previously exceeded the configured time limit and been queued, it will automatically be queued unless it processes only a small number of rows. If you edit the report, you will clear this and queuing will be based on the time limit again.  It is possible that a report you queue will not run successfully. Â  Â There are several reasons why this might happen:  You already queued the report using the same search parameters and the first queued report has not yet run.   The original report you queued was deleted after you queued it and before the queued report could be processed.   The report is deleted from the queue by another staff member before the report can be run and you can view it. Â  Â However, only the staff member who queues the report and staff members with the Analytics Administrator profile permissions can remove reports from the queue.   The queued report processes, but is not opened within the number of days specified within the PURGE_QUEUED_REPORT_DAYS configuration setting. Â  Â Queued reports and dashboards that have been run but not opened within this time period are automatically removed. Â  Â The default value for this setting is seven days.   You manually queue a report or dashboard that cannot run due to the query surpassing a limit on the number of database rows that can be accessed.

Pop-up surveys for chat sessions;Answer ID 2779;Can I use chat rules to initiate pop-up surveys for chat sessions?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Chat,Ã‚Â Business rules, Website Link Surveys Oracle B2C Service, All supported versions;"  The ability to initiate pop-up website link surveys when a chat is completed or canceled is available within Â chat rules. Â  Website Link surveys created for this purpose must have ""Allow Anonymous"" enabled for it to be available as a Pop-up survey.  Note: Selecting Allow Anonymous in your survey does not mean that all responses are anonymous. If a survey invitation is sent to a contact or an Oracle B2C Service cookie is detected on the contactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s computer, or the survey itself contains an email address field, Feedback attempts to use that information to identify the contact.  Â   The first step before creating the rules is to ensure your survey has Â rule visibility. Â  Â Rule visibility can be found on the summary tab in the survey editor. Â  Â For a survey to be visible when creating chat rules, the chats check box must be selected within the 'at a glance' window.  Note: If a survey does not have chat rule visibility, it will not be available for selection when creating the rule. Â  Â If no surveys currently have chat rule visibility, the rule options to present a survey will not be available. Also note that transactional surveys will not work with this rule action.  Chat rules are accessible from Â within the Â Site Configuration Â  &gt;  Â Rules. In versions prior to May 10 go to Service Configuration &gt; Settings. Â  Â In most cases, the survey rule should be in the initial state. Â  Â This will ensure that all chats trigger the rule. When at least one survey has chat rule visibility, and a new rule has been created, two options will become available when selecting 'add action'. Â  Â These options are: 'Pop-up Survey when Chat completes' and 'Pop-up Survey when Chat Request Canceled'  Note: This will only be displayed if the survey is in Advanced mode.  'Pop-up Survey when Chat completes' will present the survey whenever an agent or customer chooses to 'Hang-up' an active chat, as well as when rules or configuration dequeue a requested chat. 'Pop-up Survey when Chat Request Canceled' will only present a survey when a customer presses the 'Cancel' button when waiting in queue. After adding one of these options, you will have the ability to define which Survey to present and the percentage of chats which trigger the rule that will receive the Survey pop-up. Â  Â   Note: Customers must press the 'Close' button within the Chat Session browser window for the Survey to work. Â  Â If customers press the 'X' button for the browser window, the Survey will not be presented.  Additionally, if using IF criteria, Â you must Â set that criteria in a separate rule listed first (i.e. assign chat queue). Â  Then, in a second rule, you can use that criteria in the IF statement (i.e. IF chat queue equals...) and pop the chat survey.  For additional information, refer to the 'Actions for chat rules' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Common questions regarding the 'agent login' standard report;Answer ID 2781;How can we better understand the agent login report?;['Answer ID 2336'];   Analytics, Agent Login;  Why are the login hours greater than 24 hours?  The number of login hours in the Â report Â will exceed 24 hours if the agent in question Â is not logging out of the application at the end of their shift. Total login time is measured as the difference between the login date/time and the logout date/time. Â  Â Another Â factor Â that affects the total login time Â is if the agent experiences an issue/error on the workstation (or in the console) that causes the application to close unexpectedly. Â  Â In the event there is an improper logout, the system cannot always write an end time to the database, and the agent will appear to be still logged in according to database statistics. Â  Â However, when the agent logs back into the application, the system then writes the end time (i.e. logout time) as the same date/time as the login.   How can incident edit time be greater than total login time?  The total edit time is a combination of all the times that each edited incident was open in the incident editor. Â  If a user has multiple incidents open at once in the editor, these times are compiled together and therefore the total incident edit time can exceed the total login time for the measured interval.   Does logging into more than one interface effect the login time?  Logging into multiple interfaces simultaneously does not affect the login time. Â  Â There is only one session per login. Â  Â Unless the agent is actually logging out and back into multiple interfaces, there is only one login transaction written.  Best Practices note: Â  The Agent Login report should be used to see who is logging in and out at what times, and is also good for tracking the number of incident edits made by each agent per day. Â  Â Note that any change made and saved to an incident counts as an incident edit transaction (even assigning an incident to another queue or agent) and therefore this report should not be the only report used to track agent activity and productivity. For more information on the Agent Login report, refer to Answer ID 2336: Determining who has logged in to the Oracle B2C Service application

Rebuilding your local / application cache;Answer ID 2785;Can I rebuild my local cache?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Personal Settings;  You can remove the local cache entries and obtain new copies from the server without having to exit the Â Oracle B2C Service Â application and manually delete these files. Your local cache files store all option lists data (any data accessed from a drop-down menu or menu list, such as customizable menu items) plus additional data such as report and workspace definitions, questions, documents, and standard text. If you aren't sure whether your local copy of common data matches the data on the server, rebuild your local cache to retrieve the most up-to-date data. Note: Contact your CX administrator before rebuilding your local cache. If you are unsure about who your administrator is, ask your supervisor.     To rebuild your local Â cache:  Click the Application/File Â button in the top, left corner. Select Options towards the bottom of the application menu. The Oracle B2C Service Options window opens with Personal Settings displayed by default.   Check Â the 'Rebuild Local Data Cache' box under Local Data on the bottom of the window.   Click the OK button to save all changes made to your personal settings. You will be prompted to confirm your request to rebuild your local cache.   Click the Yes button so Â Oracle B2C Service Â can determine what files need to be retrieved and the amount of data that will be retrieved. Once this analysis is completed, the data retrieval begins and a progress bar displays.  Once all data is received from the server and written to the cache, the progress bar closes as does the Oracle B2C Service Options window.  Â  Â  Â  5. Â  Next, close and log out of RightNow to complete the cache rebuilding process.

Â  Â  To do this, Â enter a static value in the Column Mappings Â using the format (""&lt;value&gt;""). For example, if you wanted to associate all imported records with the United States, the value of the column field would be (US). In Oracle B2C Service, open the Data Import Wizard. Â  Â On page Â 2 of the wizard, you will be prompted to map columns from the .csv file to fields within the application. Â  Â If you want to set Â a static value Â for all contacts, use these steps:  Select 'Add' in the column mappings area Select the data field from the 'Field' column Under Default Value, enter the value needed Continue with import as normal  Note: Â We recommend that you upload no more than 1 million max contacts at a time and that the file size should not exceed 20 MB. If necessary, you can break a large set of contacts into smaller groupings as necessary and do multiple uploads."

Understanding the functionality of the thesaurus wordlist file;Answer ID 2787;How is the thesaurus wordlist file used when searching the enduser answer pages?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Word List files, All versions;" The thesaurus.txt file contains a list of words and their synonyms used in the Similar Phrases search technique on the Answers page. Words in the text search are matched with synonyms to extend the searching capability to include ontologies. The word and its synonyms must be uppercase and comma delimited as seen in the example below. The thesaurus word list file is similar to the aliases word list file Â in that only the first word listed on each line in the thesaurus file can be used to represent the rest of the aliases on that line. Â  Â For example, if the following line is entered into the file: FRUIT,APPLE,PEACH,PEAR,GRAPE then a search on the word FRUIT will be equivalent to searching on APPLE,PEACH,PEAR and GRAPE. Â  Â However, this is not the same as a search on GRAPE being equivalent to FRUIT,APPLE,PEACH,PEAR. Â  Â If the intent is to also have GRAPE be equivalent to the rest of these terms, you will need to add an additional line in the thesaurus file as in the following: GRAPE,FRUIT,APPLE,PEACH,PEAR There are a few other items that need to be enabled before you can effectively use the thesaurus word list file on your enduser pages. Â  Â Please ensure the following items are enabled and used on your site. STEPS TO ENABLE: Add keywords to your thesaurus wordlist file using the File Manager (Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; File Manager &gt; Â  Â switch to: wordlist files) Important Note: Use extreme caution when using the File Manager. The files you can modify affect your production site. Before you edit or replace a file, make a backup copy of the original file, either on the server or locally. This backup will allow you to revert to the original configuration if necessary. The SearchTypeList widget would need to be added to the page. Create answers that contain ANY of the keywords found in your thesaurus wordlist file and make sure they are public answers. When searching on the enduser pages, you must select 'similar phrases' from the 'search by' dropdown box Â for the thesaurus to work. You must search on the first word of the line as mentioned above. Â  Â In the examples above, this was either FRUIT or GRAPE. Â  Â When you do, all the other words on the line will be looked up in ALL your answers and returned as results."

Report Linking in Oracle B2C Service Analytics;Answer ID 2789;What is report linking?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Report Linking feature Oracle B2C Service (OSvC), May 2009 and later;  Oracle B2C Service Analytics offers the ability to include links in reports that take the user to a separate report. Â  Because linked reports allow you to seamlessly drill down from one report to another, users no longer need to recreate identical levels for multiple reports - users can Â create the level once and have multiple reports link to it. Â  Before you create report links, you should be familiar with the variables and run-time selectable filters in the reports or dashboards you are linking to since you define the values you want to use for these every time you create a report link. In addition, you should know whether you want to use unconditional or conditional links. Users can create links between reports using the Report Linking wizard or the Conditional Report Linking wizard. Â  The wizards are similar, though the Conditional Report Linking wizard includes an additional step. Reports can be linked using unconditional or conditional links: Unconditional links - Â use an unconditional link to open a specific report when you drill down on any value in the parent reportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s linked column. The content in the linked report can vary depending on the reportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s filters and the value you drill down on, but you will link to the same report regardless of the value selected in the parent reportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s column. This functionality is similar to drilling down on a value in a column to open another report level. Conditional links - Â use conditional links to open different reports when you drill down on different values in the parent reportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s linked column. For example, you could add two conditional links to a column that lists a contactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s service level agreements to open two different reports, depending on the SLA that is drilled down on. Just as with unconditional links, the content in the linked reports can vary depending on the linked reportsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ filters and the values you drill down on. For more information on linked reports and the steps to access each Report Linking wizard, refer to the 'Linking reports' section in online Â documentation for your version, located in Answer ID 5168: Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Ignoring invalid survey responses;Answer ID 2795;Is there a way to keep invalid survey responses from showing up in the survey results report?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Feedback, Analytics, Surveys;"  You can exclude survey responses that you deem invalid. Â  This feature allows an entire user's response to a survey to be excluded from the results set. The responses will not be deleted, but it will keep them from showing up in the survey results report. This feature can be turned on or off via a Feedback profile setting. Select the ""Response Exclusion"" permission on the Feedback tab to allow staff members with this profile to exclude specific survey responses from reports. For information on Feedback profile permissions, Â refer to Â Feedback Permissions Â in online documentation.  Go to Configuration, click on Profiles, choose the profile you want to change the setting for. Click the Permissions button on the ribbon and then choose the Feedback tab. In the Survey section, Â select the check box for Â Response Exclusion. Â  Click Save.  When viewing survey results within a report, simply right-click on the users response and choose ""Response Exclusion Flow"". Â  Â A text box will appear giving the choice to either Include Response or Exclude Response. Â  The entire survey result is for that user is Â excluded, even though in reports you will be choosing the exclusion from an individual question/answer. The exclude field is a runtime filter on applicable survey reports so that even excluded results can be shown if desired. Â  Please note, this feature does not work when cross tabbing is used in the report, or if the report displays data from multiple responses in a single row.  For more information, please see the 'Excluding survey responses' section in online documentation (path: Feedback &gt; Surveys &gt; Creating broadcast surveys &gt; Viewing survey results &gt; Excluding survey responses) for the version your site is currently running.

Chat agent status set in profile;Answer ID 2799;Can administrators automatically set an agent's status when they log in to chat?;['Answer ID 2156', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle Service Chat;"  Oracle B2C Service administrators have the ability to set chat agent statuses in individual profiles. Â  When agents log in to Chat, Â their Agent Â Status drop-down menu will display Â just the statuses selected for them by the administrator. Administrators may also set a default agent status in an agent's profile; this may be particularly helpful when administrators need Â to log agents directly into Â Chat after logging into the Oracle B2C Service application. Â  Steps to Set Chat Status Visibility and Default Status  Open the Profile editor and select the profile to be modified Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles   Select Permissions, then Service tab The administrator may select specific chat statuses which are visible to the agents associated to the profile by ensuring the desired chat statuses are moved to the box titled ""Assigned"".  For Example: Highlight a status from the ""Available"" list and select the arrow to move the status to the ""Assigned"" list on the right. To remove statuses, do the reverse. Note: Default statuses such as 'Available - Unrestricted', Â 'Unavailable - Unqualified' and 'Logged Out - Unspecified' Â cannot be removed from the Assigned list.   The selected radio button next to the chat status will determine the default chat status for the profile. Â  Â Therefore, if the profile has a default chat status of ""Available - Unrestricted"", any agent using the profile will automatically be set to an available status and start receiving chats upon logging into the chat service. Â  The default is also noted below the ""Assigned"" listing.      Answer ID 2156: Chat agent statuses in Chat Â provides more information on default chat statuses and adding custom statuses.

Bounced E-mail message handling;Answer ID 2800;How does OracleÃ‚Â handle bounced email messages?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Outbound Email Oracle B2C Service;  A Ã¢â‚¬Å“bounced e-mail messageÃ¢â‚¬Â (or simply Ã¢â‚¬Å“bounceÃ¢â‚¬Â) is a message that cannot be delivered to its destination. Usually, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will return the e-mail to the sender along with some information indicating why the message could not be delivered. These Â different kinds of bounces can be grouped depending on whether the fault lies with the sender, the receiver, or somewhere in between. When it handles bounces due to problems with the recipient, it may invalidate the recipientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s e-mail address. This cleans mailing lists and segments by preventing any future mailings from being sent to that recipient, this is Â an important step in maintaining a good sender reputation. When techmail handles bounces due to problems with the sender or problems in transit, it takes no automatic action. For all bounces, regardless of type, it records as much information as possible for reporting.  Bounce types:  Soft bounce Ã¢â‚¬â€œ An email was returned because of a temporary problem with the recipient's mailbox (for example, the mailbox has exceeded its available size limit). Service incident emails that result in soft bounces are not automatically re-sent by the system. If you want to resend an incident response that has bounced, you must manually respond to the incident again. Conversely, when Techmail detects that a soft bounce has been returned from a mailing or survey invitation email, it places that message in a mail queue and attempts to resend it for up to seven days (the default value specified by the BOUNCE_RETRY_WINDOW configuration setting).  However, if a contact's email address returns soft bounces three consecutive times with no contact activity in the previous fifteen days (as specified by the INVALID_NUM_BOUNCES and INVALID_NUM_DAYS configuration settings), the address is marked as invalid. Once a contact's email has been invalidated, the system does not send mailings or surveys to that address.  Hard bounce Ã¢â‚¬â€œ An email was returned because of a permanent problem with the recipient's mailbox, and the problem is not expected to be resolved (for example, the recipient mail server indicates that the email address does not exist). When a hard bounce is received, the contact email address is marked invalid and no resend attempt is made. When techmail encounters a hard bounce, it immediately invalidates the contactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s e-mail address to prevent further mailings from being sent.  General bounce Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A mailing or survey invitation email was returned due to technical problems with the delivery of the message. That is, the problem is not on the sender's end nor the recipient's end, but in the transmission of the message over the network in between. It is therefore difficult to predict the likelihood of resolution. General bounces are logged in the database but no further action is taken. No resend attempt is made and the contact email address is not marked invalid.  Unknown bounce Ã¢â‚¬â€œ An email was returned for a reason that could not be determined. Unknown bounces are logged in the database but no further action is taken. No resend attempt is made and the contact email address is not marked invalid.  Forced unknown bounce -- An email was returned and the error code is not a recognized bounce code. Typically emails will bounce with a SMTP 500 type error, but on occasion bounces do not have a typical 500 type error.  It is possible to re-validate contacts whose e-mail addresses have been invalidated due to bounce activity. In the contact workspace editor, there are fields named Primary Email Invalid, Alternate Email 1 Invalid, and Alternate Email 2 Invalid. With these fields added to a contact workspace, the contactsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ e-mail addresses can be re-validated simply by editing the contact record. These fields are also available for contact multi-edit workspaces. This allows you to re-validate multiple contact e-mail addresses at once. Please note, however, that we strongly recommend submitting an incident to Technical Support and allowing us to assist you in re-validating large numbers of contacts. Large-scale re-validations can lead to e-mailing large numbers of invalid addresses, which can severely damage your reputation as a sender. Reputation damage, in turn, can lead to ISP blocks and blacklists, which reduces the efficacy of e-mail as a marketing tool, and reduces your ability to reach your customers. To view mailing bounce statistics, visit the Mailing Delivery Analysis report located at \Public Reports\Outreach\Email Performance. This report shows the number of messages sent, number delivered, a count of each type of bounce that occurred, and percentages for each count. There is one row for each format associated with the mailing, and a bar chart that displays a visual representation of bounce information aggregated over all formats in the mailing.    In other cases, Techmail may receive an error code indicating that a mailing or survey invitation email was blocked by the recipient mail server. When this happens, Techmail attempts to identify the reason the block and classifies it as one of the following block types.   Content block - An email was blocked due to its content. In other words, some part of the message content triggered a filter that prevented the message from being delivered.  Sender block - An email was blocked due to the sender's reputation. This means that the sender has not developed a trusted relationship with the recipient provider.  General block - An email was blocked for a reason that could not be determined.  When techmail encounters a block error, it logs the error in the database but does not attempt to resend the message, nor does it invalidate the contact email address.  For additional information, refer to the 'Email bounce handling' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Workspace tabs change their position with no workspace edits;Answer ID 2804;What causes my workspace tabs to be out of order even though my workspace has not been edited?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Ability to move tabs within a workspace;"  There are several settings in a workspace that are specific to a user's account; text size, font, and tab order are several examples. Â  Â The tab order in your workspace can be changed simply by clicking and dragging Â a tab into another location. Â  Â Once you exit out of the workspace, the new tab order will display any time that the workspace is opened. Â  Â It is possible Â to accidentally change this tab order by dragging the tab instead of simply clicking on it, and if you find that your workspace has changed, this is likely what happened, especially if other users of the same workspace do not see the changed tab order. To change it back, open a single instance of the workspace, drag the tabs into the desired order, and close the workspace again. There is not a way to lock tabs in place.

Error messages when opening incident file attachments;Answer ID 2810;Why am I getting an error message when I try to open incident attachments?;['Answer ID 5168'];   File Attachments Oracle B2C Service;  This is often caused by illegal characters entered into the attachment's name - caused by copying a file path that includes a new line or carriage return from another application straight into the Oracle B2C Service. Â  Â Simply deleting those values should fix the attachment and allow you to open it. This is correctable within the console by right-clicking on the incident attachment, and clicking Properties. Â  Â If there is an illegal character in the file name, you can generally see it as a [][] value in the File Name field. Â  Â   Guidelines for file names for attachments: 1. Use upper or lowercase alphanumeric characters and the underscore symbol, Â Oracle B2C Service  Â does not preserve letter case. A mix of upper and lowercase characters is allowed but ignored 2. File names begin with a letter or an underscore characters. 3. File name cannot include spaces or other special characters such as # or @. 4. File name lengths are restricted to 100 characters. 5. File names characters must comply with UTF-8 encoding rules regardless of the language of the interface used.  Â  6. There are no system Â reserved words for file names.

Sort by Menu Sequence;Answer ID 2812;HowÃ‚Â can I specify the order of menuÃ‚Â fields in my report?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Changing sort options Oracle B2C Service;"  Menu fields can be sorted by the sequence of the field's entries. Â  Note: This option is available only Â when editing Â custom reports. Â It is not available at run-time.  Â    Click to enlarge image  By default, when sorting information in a report using a menu field, the information is sorted by the menu fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entries in alphabetic order. For example, in an incident custom menu field for severity, the options are: Â 1 = Severe, 2 = Mid-Range, and 3 = Unimportant. Â  In ascending order, which is alphabetical, the Â output would list records with Mid-Range, then Severe, and then Unimportant severities. However, when editing a custom report and defining the reportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s default sort order (Home ribbon &gt; Analyze &gt; Sort &gt; shown in the above screen shot), you can select the Sort by Menu Sequence check box to sort by the order of the menu fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entries. Therefore, sorting the Severity field by sequence in ascending order would result in records with Severe, then Mid-Range, and then Unimportant severities. In this example, this sort order would likely be more helpful for those using the report.

You can  choose to load an answer, contact, incident, opportunity, organization, quote, quote product, or task        Â      Â  Changes [record]: Associate the working record to a different organization, contact, answer, incident, or opportunity        Â      Â  Clear [record]: Clear the association between the working record and an organization, contact, answer, incident, or opportunity        Â      Â  Copy [record]: Copy the working record and give it a name that can be referenced later in the workflow            Â  Save: Â  Save all records open in the workflow            Â  Connector: used to link elements in the workflow     Once a workflow has been created and tested, it is deployed by assigning the workflow to staff profiles in the same fashion as a workspace is assigned to a profile.  When setting a field value with a workspace rule action, script rule action, or Set Field workflow element, you can now choose to set a relative value. Relative values are defined by adding or subtracting (or appending or prepending) a value to the fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous value. For example, you can create a script rule that increments the value of an integer field by 1. Or, to support a return merchandise authorization (RMA) process you can create a workspace rule that prepends Ã¢â‚¬Å“RMA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Â to the subject line of an incident with a disposition of RMA, to return a value such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“RMA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ faulty phone.Ã¢â‚¬Â For date and date/time fields, you can also set a value relative to the time of action. For instance, you can configure a workspace rule to set a date/time field to the current date and time plus twenty-four hours. Relative values are supported for date, date/time, integer, text, and text area fields.  NOTE: Desktop Workflow Â is an add-on module that must be purchased.

Reporting data seems incorrect or behind;Answer ID 2817;Many of ourÃ‚Â agents are making changes, but when we open our reports, those changes don't appear to be made for several minutes.;['Answer ID 5094', 'Answer ID 9093', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Custom Report Options,Ã‚Â Data source Analytics Oracle B2C Service,Ã‚Â All versions;"  There are two databases your report can use: the operational database and the replication server. The replication server is a copy which is constantly being Â updated from Â the operational database. If the replication server falls behind in syncing to the production server, then updates to reports will not show immediately. Â  Â In most cases, your replication connection will be up to date. However, there may be times when the replication server falls behind and replication may be up to 72 hours old. This is normal &amp; expected behavior. Most of the replication servers have multiple database servers replicating to them, so heavy input and output on any one of the production servers can cause replication to fall behind on the replication server. Other factors that may cause a server to fall behind include:  Backups being performed Multiple reports running on the replication server Poorly formed database queries being run against the replication server Table alters running against large database tables. These originate from custom field and custom object deployments along with alters initiated on the production site when the upgrade site is created.  These actions lock database tables and prevent the replication process from writing to the replication server. Our Cloud Operations department constantly monitors these replication servers. When a server does fall behind, our staff must wait for the process to finish that has caused the delay. Once the process finishes, the replication server must catch up to bring the production server and replication server in sync, which can take some time on a high volume site. For reports where real-time information is needed, you should use the operational database. This would include reports Â such as ""My Inbox"" that run on small amounts of data but need to have the very latest data. For large reports that run on historic data, such as a report that analyzes incident creation rates over the last 6 months, you should use the replication server. Â This Â allows you to run larger queries, but may not have the last few updates made today. Â  Reports using the replication server will not allow you to use the ""Fill Inbox"" button, since the data that they are using is potentially old data. To determine which database your report is using, follow the steps below:  Open the report for edit Â  On the Home tab select the ""Options"" button and then ""More Options""   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â  Â    The Edit Settings dialog will open. Near the bottom there is a label ""Data Source"" and you can choose either ""Report Database"" or ""Operational Database"".   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â     For Queuing and Data Source Options for Standard Reports, Â refer to Answer ID 5094: Standard report is queuing. For data source information in dashboards, see Answer ID 9093: All reports within a dashboard must run against a single database. Other selections under Data Source: Allow server to change the data source as necessary: Select this check box to allow Â Oracle B2C Service to automatically change the data source if necessary to allow the report to run. For example, if a report is configured to run on the operational database but is unable to do so due to data constraints, selecting this check box allows the report to run on the report database. Clearing this check box forces reports to run on the data source that is selected. Â  This feature appears in November Â 2009 and later releases. NOTE: This check box is selected by default when you create a report and is also automatically selected any time the data source is changed on the Edit Settings window. Set report to deferred execution: Select this check box to automatically queue your report when it runs. Â  Â  Â  NOTE: If this option is not selected but the report is automatically queued the next time it is run due to meeting queuing criteria, the 'Set report to deferred execution' check box is automatically selected. To prevent the report from being queued when it is next run, edit the report and clear this check box. Tracking functionality is available in Â reports in regards to the particular databases. They now keep track of whether or not a person has set the database used in the report. If a Â user has not Â specified which Â database the report will use and a Â user subsequently Â tries to run the report on more data than is allowed by the operating database, then the report will automatically switch to using the replication server. If the report is edited, it will revert back to using the operational database. To stop this automatic switching from occurring, edit the report and then specify a database. This will mark the database as ""user set"" and the report will no longer switch. For more information on changing report options, see Â the 'Selecting report options' section in online documentation for your version.

Creating new SLAs rather than modifying existing ones;Answer ID 2820;Why are the changes that I've made to my SLA not affecting contacts and organizations as before?;['Answer ID 4191'];   Service Level Agreements (SLAs);"  Once an SLA has been applied it is best to not make any modifications to it, but rather create a new SLA with your changes instead. When an SLA is modified in the database, the new version is not automatically applied to the contact and organization records. Â Instead, you must remove the older SLA instance and save the contact or organization record, then Â the updated SLA can be applied to the contact or organization record.  Options: 1. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Manually go through each contact and/or organization and disable the original SLA and then apply the new version of the SLA to the contact and/or organization records. Â  Â Note that SLAs can either be applied at the organization level (which automatically applies the SLA to all associated contacts), or can be applied to individual contact records which have no organization association. Â  Â Therefore you may need to edit either contacts or organizations, or both. 2. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â To multi-edit contacts and organizations: Option 1 (to edit affected contacts):  Create a new rule with ""THEN"" actions that would ""terminate existing SLA"", and ""create SLA instance"". Create a report containing all the contacts or organizations that have the older version of the SLA applied. Export this data to a .csv file. Using the Data Import Â Wizard, upload the contacts, specifying that you want the contact rules to run against these contacts. Once completed, disable or delete this rule to prevented accidental activation.  Option 2 (to edit affected contacts and/or organizations):   Create a contact Â and/or organization radio type custom field. Edit your Contact and/or Organization Multi-edit workspace to include your new contact or Organization custom field. Create a new contact and or organization rule with the new custom field as the ""IF"" condition, and the ""THEN"" actions that would ""terminate existing SLA"", and ""create SLA instance"" Create a report that will show you all contacts or organizations with the old version of the SLA applied. Run your report and multi-edit the resulting contacts or organizations. Â  Â Choose to edit the custom field value. Â  Â This will trigger the contacts or organizations to be updated, which will cause them to run through the contact or organization rules, and trigger your new rule, which will replace the old version of the SLA, with the new version of the SLA."

Desktop Workflow Best Practices;Answer ID 2824;Here are some Desktop Workflow Best Practices to help you get the most out of this feature.;['Answer ID 5168'];   Best Practices  Desktop Workflow Introduced in the August 2009 version;"  Desktop Workflow can be complicated to understand. Â  Here are some best practices to make the utilization of this feature easier. Getting Started  Be sure to understand the business use case first before attempting to build it in the Workflow designer. Â  Â Create a detailed map of what you want to accomplish and sketch out a diagram to illustrate the business case and flow. Have a good understanding of when to use Agent Scripting, Workflows, Guided Assistance, rules, etc. Have a good understanding of how scripts and workspaces interact with server rules and understand the relationships between them.  Process Tips  There are multiple places to put logic in a workflow: Â  Â in a decision point, in a connector, or inside an element like a script or a workspace. The best place will depend on your use case. Â  Â Be sure to consider manageability of the workflow when making this decision. Scripting and/or Workflow can effectively replace complicated Workspaces with lots of rules by breaking the workspace up into multiple script pages or multiple workspaces joined using workflow decisions. Â  Â This can dramatically improve application performance. When using workspace rules to hide or display tabs or panels on a workspace, utilize the hidden property in the workspace. When hiding or displaying fields on a workspace, one option which will improve performance is to put them into multiple tabs or panels Â and then hide the tab or panel rather than each field. Use scripting when you want to collect data and change fields. Use guided assistance when you want to just guide the agent and do not need to collect or change data. Use custom fields to manage workflow state. Use workflow to update custom fields depending on where an agent is in a flow. Example: When an Agent completes step 2 of a flow, update a field with ""2"". Â  Â The flow could then be restarted at a later time and an initial decision point could take them directly to step 2, skipping step 1.  Manageability Tips  Break up complicated workspaces and scripts with lots of contextual rules or pages into multiple workspaces or scripts. In addition to improving performance, this will greatly improve manageability when Â changes occur. Compartmentalize and isolate functions in their own routine, so they can be re-used. Â  Â This will increase the reusability of workspaces and scripts.

How to decrypt a data dump;Answer ID 2825;What are the instructions for a customer to decrypt a data dump we send them?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Decrypt, Data Export;"  Your Data Export is delivered in a standard MySQL export format. You can request a Data Export as well as other Oracle Consulting engagements by contacting your Sales Account Manager. They will be available to answer any questions you may have. If you have had a Data Export performed and are in possession of the Data Export URL and passphrase please see decryption instructions below. If you do not have the technical ability to parse or understand your Data in the format provided, please contact your Sales Account Manager and they can engage you with our Oracle Consulting group. GPG Decryption How to:  Download decryption software such as GPG4Win a. http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html b. Download the latest stable version Install GPG4Win (May require a system restart) Open GPG4Win (called Kleopatra) Click on File &gt; Decrypt/Verify Files, navigate to your .gpg file. Â  Â    This will ask for your passphrase. Enter the passphrase provided by Oracle B2C Service and choose the directory where you would like your files unzipped.  Hints:    Be absolutely sure you enter the correct passphrase. If you are not sure of any of the characters in the passphrase cut and paste the character into a text editor and change the font. This may help to make any ambiguous characters clear.  Be sure to unzip the directory to a secure location with enough storage space. Data Exports are very large files.  If the unzipped folder appears empty, be sure to uncheck ""Input file is an archive; unpack with: "" in GPG4Win (Kleopatra)       A successful Data Export and extraction will result in several files in SQL format or CSV. The steps required to migrate data from one database to another will require a Database Administrator. The full Data Dictionary is not available outside of the application. However, it is possible to copy/paste information from the Data Dictionary. It may be useful to do this for all tables you know will be of use to create your own abridged version of a data dictionary resource.

Householding - email address sharing;Answer ID 2831;If our organization works with a group of related contacts, how can I associate multiple contact records with a single email?;['Answer ID 5653', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Email Sharing (householding) Oracle B2C Service, All supported versions;  Email address sharing allows a family or a team to maintain individual contact records while utilizing a single email address.    When shared contact addresses are in different fields (for example, contacts.email_alt1 and contacts.email_alt2), the system selects the contact whose address is in the field of highest precedence (contacts.email_alt1). However, if the shared addresses are in the same field (for example, both are in contacts.email_alt1), the system attempts to match First Name and Last Name fields values, if available. If no match is found based on field precedence or name values, the system selects the contact record last updated in the database. The simplistic duplicate criteria includes the login field. A login must be unique for each contact if Email Address Sharing is enabled. Â  Â Note: The login field is case sensitive meaning 'user' is different than 'User'. Contact records that share the same email address must have a unique login, or, for contacts without a login, they must include a unique combination of first name and last name, as duplicate contact records cannot exist in the knowledge base. For example, Bill Short and Bill Short (same name) can share the same email address as long as they have different logins. If multiple contacts' logins are left blank, their first or last name must be unique. In this case, Bill Short and William Short can share the same email address, since each name is unique. Email addresses associated with a single contact record must be unique-that is, for a single contact, the values of contacts.email, contacts.email_alt1, and contacts.email_alt2 cannot contain the same address. The contact-matching process applies to areas of Oracle B2C Service that associate contacts by email address, including chats, mailings, web forms, site feedback, Techmail transactions, and Ask a Question requests submitted with only an email address. Because email address sharing impacts several functional areas of Oracle B2C Service, it is important to understand its impact in those areas before you enable it. Refer to Answer ID 5653: Areas affected by email address sharing. To enable email address sharing:  Click Configuration button on the navigation pane. Click Database. Click Email Address Sharing. Click Enabled. Â  Â A message warns you that duplicate email address safeguards will be removed. Click OK.

Widget Override in Customer Portal;Answer ID 2832;Is there a way one widget can be overridden by another?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2829'];   Customer Portal;"  There is a Customer Portal framework improvement that allows the standard or custom widget folder designation in the code that calls a widget Â to Â now be optional. When a path is not specified, the custom folder is searched first; if there is a widget by that name in the custom folder, the custom widget is called rather than the standard one. This lets you replace a Oracle B2C Service standard widget with a customized one that uses the same name, so you do not have to find and replace all calls to the new widget within all pages and other widgets. When a path to the custom or standard folder is specified, the code continues to support it. For more information on widget overriding, please refer to the Customer Portal manual.

Â  You can also select a contact to use for filtering preview data for more accurate rendering on the content editorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Preview tab.  By default, report merge applies a primary filter to the report in several situations to limit the output so that customers will see only their own information. For example, if the report lists contacts and their open incidents, customers will see only their own open incidents. Primary filters are automatically applied in the following cases.  contacts.c_idÃ¢â‚¬â€Primary filter for any mailing (broadcast or transactional) and any survey invitation message. If merging a report on a web page, the contact must be recognized by click-through parameters or cookies. Important Duplicate messages sent to a single address is a common characteristic of spam.

Using word boundaries in rules: Avoid matching text that is part of another word;Answer ID 2851;A string that I wish to match in a regular expression is also part of another word that I do not wish to match.;['Answer ID 1976', 'Answer ID 861'];  Business Rules All versions;" You may wish to find a character string using rules and then perform some action (e.g. queue routing, assignment, set status, etc...). Â  Â It is best to use a regular expression operator in your rules to do this (which is highly recommended over the ""Contains"" operator). For instance, if you were looking for the words ""Jump"", ""jumped"", ""jumping"" in incoming emails, you could put the string 'jump' into the regular expression condition and find all of these. In other cases (e.g. spam or profanity rules), you have a string that you wish to filter that also will show up as part of another word that you do not wish to filter. Â  Â For instance, the words ""assistance"" or ""assume"" would often be filtered if a profanity rule with a regular expression had the first three letters of these words. Â  Â This type of spam/profanity rule is common and causes many valid emails (containing the words ""assistance"" or ""assume"") to be filtered. How do we get around this? Â  Â We have to take a different approach in the regular expression. Â  Â This involves the use of a word boundary around the regular expression string. Â  Â When using a word boundary in a regular expression, the regex engine looks for the string that you specify, but will only match it if it is surrounded on both sides by any ""non-word character"" (i.e. a space, dash, or a special character (!$%^.&lt;&gt;*|()?/\ : ;)). Please note that alpha-numeric characters and underscores are considered word characters. A word boundary allows you to effectively match only the regular expression string, but not match other words that contain that character string (e.g. not match ""assistance""). The format of a word boundary for the RightNow regular expressions engine looks as follows:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â [[:&lt;:]]word_here[[:&gt;:]] For users of Â May 2017 version of the product Â the word bound is:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  \&lt;word_here\&gt; NOTE: There are no spaces within or on either side of the word. The RightNow product uses ""ereg -i"" regular expression engine. Â  Â The -i option makes the regular expressions pattern matching case insensitive (i.e. upper and lower case will match the same). Â  Â This means that the regular expression [[:&lt;:]]jump[[:&gt;:]] matches Jump, JUMP,JuMp, etc... Â  Â Because of the word boundary tags around jump this would not match ""jumped"". Â  Â In this example the 'p' in jump is next to the word character, 'e'. Â  Â In the profanity example above, the words ""assistance"" or ""assumption"" would not be filtered if you put the first 3 letters into a word boundary in a profanity rule. To help ensure that you are not filtering emails/updates it is highly recommended that you test your regular expressions once you have put them in place so that you do not filter valid emails unintentionally. Â  Â Additionally, it is very important to have an address in the ""Send Rejected Messages to"" field on the incoming tab of the mailbox settings. Â  Â More on this can be found in the following answer: Â  Answer ID 1976: Accessing discarded email messages For more information on regular expressions, please refer to Answer ID 861: Rule is matching an incorrect expression.

Understanding and Troubleshooting Answer Score and Weight;Answer ID 3117;How are answers scored and weighted within the answer list page or search results?;['Answer ID 790', 'Answer ID 5874', 'Answer ID 1346', 'Answer ID 2379', 'Answer ID 409', 'Answer ID 1771', 'Answer ID 4239', 'Answer ID 2258', 'Answer ID 1301', 'Answer ID 4692', 'Answer ID 1660', 'Answer ID 2307', 'Answer ID 2492', 'Answer ID 4145', 'Answer ID 2234', 'Answer ID 1355', 'Answer ID 1154', 'Answer ID 1222', 'Answer ID 1733', 'Answer ID 1447', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Knowledge Foundation Answers, Score, Solved Count, Weight, Display Position Oracle B2C Service, all versions;"  The score is calculated from the static score and the solved count from both customers and agents, including a combination of long-term and short-term solved counts. By default, solved counts from the web portal (customer's experiences) account for 75 percent of the score, and agent scores account for 25 percent.  Â Over time, an answer's solved count gradually declines as it is viewed less frequently. The weight (also called matched weight) of an answer or incident is calculated when a text search is performed. It is based on the frequency of keywords or phrases included.  Â The location of the keyword or phrase also matters. For example, words in the Subject or Summary weight higher than those appearing in the answer or threads fields. Below are resources to help understand the answer score and weight, along with Â related terms: Methodology behind the answer score value Long-term and Short-term solved counts Comparing the weight, score and computed score  Within the application, there are configurable options to influence the display order and weighted value of answers.  Â Refer to the following for more information: Optimal sort order for published answers on the Moving a public answer up or down in the display order Affecting the weight used with search results Answer Search Bias Always listing an answer first in the search results  Additional elements that can have an impact on search results are as follows: Keywords field when editing answers Alias words increase search weight Adding synonyms to be used when searching for answers Enabling Other Suggested Searches on the end-user pages Configuring Search Priority Words and Recommended Documents Tuning the stopword list Suggesting spelling corrections and common word usage for end-user searches  Occasionally, unexpected search results can occur.  Â Expand each section below to find more information on identifying and resolving each behavior. Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  When I searching on our site, why don't the best matches appear at the top of the list of results?  Issue: Search results do not appear to have the strongest matches listed at the top. Resolution: This can be an indication that search results are not being sorted by the proper field as set by the report for that page.  Â Refer to Â Answer 1355: When searching, best matches do not appear at the top of the search results Â for information to resolve.  Why do results include answers that do not include the word or phrase I searched for?  Issue: Answers are returned that do not include the phrase searched on. For example, when searching our site for the word ""indices"", several answers are listed, but many do not include that word. Resolution: This can be a result of excluded words being matched or word-stemming being applied. Refer to Â Answer 1154: Getting more answers than expected when searching end-user pages Â for more information on these functions.  Why are search options different for answers and incident in the console?  Issue: Options for phrase searching are different in the console for answers than they are for incidents. Resolution: By design, different search techniques provide better search results for answers versus incidents. For more information on these techniques, refer to Â Answer 1222: Searching differences between answers and incidents.

End-user absent in Chat message;Answer ID 4026;When an agent engages in a chat, we continuously get a message that says the end-user is absent.;['Answer ID 8282', 'Answer ID 10540', 'Answer ID 8298', 'Answer ID 6322'];"   Chat - End-user client, Chat - Agent console Oracle Service Chat  Issue   When your chat agents see the following message while engaged in a chat:Ã‚Â Ã‚Â   ""EndUserNameÃ‚Â is currently absent. Approximately X number ofÃ‚Â seconds until disconnect""";"  This messaging means that the end-user is experiencing connectivity issues to the chat server. You can configure the amount of time that you will give an end-user or an agent to reconnect to the chat server after they have been disconnected, before the chat will end automatically. Â  Â You can specify this with the following configuration settings: ABSENT_INTERVAL: Â  If the chat service Â does not receive Â at least one polling request from a client within ABSENT_INTERVAL seconds, the client will be marked as ABSENT by Oracle Service Chat Â and given additional time (controlled by Â the retry count) to reconnect to the system. Default is Â 120. AGENT_ABSENT_RETRY_COUNT: Â  Â  Specifies the number of 'absent intervals' that an agent is allowed to miss before being disconnected from the chat service. Â  Â An 'absent interval' is the failure to communicate with the chat service for the number of seconds as defined in the ABSENT_INTERVAL configuration setting. Default is 2. If the chat service Â does not receive at least one polling request from an agent within ABSENT_INTERVAL * AGENT_ABSENT_RETRY_COUNT seconds, the agent will be disconnected from Oracle Service Chat and all chats currently assigned to the agent will be requeued. USER_ABSENT_RETRY_COUNT: Â  Â  Specifies the number of 'absent intervals' that a chat user is allowed to miss before being disconnected from the chat service. Â  Â An 'absent interval' is the failure to communicate with the chat service for the number of seconds as defined in the ABSENT_INTERVAL configuration setting. Default is 10. If the chat service does not receive at least one polling request from the user within ABSENT_INTERVAL * USER_ABSENT_RETRY_COUNT seconds, the user will be disconnected from Oracle Service Chat Â and the user's chat will be concluded. If you have the ABSENT_INTERVAL configuration setting set to 120 seconds, and the AGENT_ABSENT_RETRY_COUNT configuration setting set to 10, you will be giving the end-user 1200 seconds to re-connect to the chat server before the chat is automatically ended, as 120 seconds for each interval x Â 10 intervals = 1200 seconds. Â  Â  There is not a way to turn these messages off, as it serves as a warning to the end-users and/or agents that they are not currently connected to the chat service and could be disconnected.

Surveys by Proxy;Answer ID 4038;What is a survey by proxy and how do I use it?;['Answer ID 2457', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Broadcast, Transactional, or Web Link survey Oracle B2C Service; Any broadcast, transactional, or web link survey can be added to a workspace, enabling your agents to complete surveys on behalf of contacts during telephone interactions. Surveys can be embedded in contact, organization, incident, or opportunity workspaces by inserting a Survey By Proxy control. Together with Oracle B2C Service FeedbackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advanced mode features, proxy surveys can be used to initiate more complex processes, such as creating leads and tasks, setting contact field values, sending staff notifications, and triggering external events. This makes proxy surveys useful for meeting a variety of key business needs. An incident-based proxy survey can be used by customer support agents to invite feedback about how a support call was handled or assess interest in new service offerings. An organization-based or contact-based proxy survey can be used by marketing personnel to prequalify leads and opportunities for the sales team or add contacts to mailing lists based on their explicitly confirmed interests. Opportunity-based proxy surveys can be used by sales reps to gather feedback about specific sales interactions or assess how well a product fits a given area of need. To create a proxy survey in a workspace: Open the workspace you want to add the proxy to. From the Insert Control tab, choose Survey by Proxy Drag the control to the location in the workspace where you want it. Select the control on the design space and click the Design tab in the ribbon at top. Select Surveys, choose the survey you want in the control. Save workspace.

Web Form security;Answer ID 4056;What security features are available for form submissions in the Oracle B2C Service application?;['Answer ID 5168'];   CAPTCHA May 2010 and newer;"  Oracle Â Service Cloud Â has security features tied to web form submissions. This provides customers with an extra layer of security against malicious botnets and other attacks attempting to compromise site Â integrity and security.  Sample CAPTCHA dialog A Â CAPTCHA opens on the customer portal when the system detects abuse. Daily webform traffic Â is monitored and when they reach a specific threshold, then CAPTCHA is displayed. Â  If abuse is detected, the system begins Â injecting CAPTCHA verification dialogs into the pages. Â  When a user successfully completes the CAPTCHA question, the system allows their session to continue as it normally would, and abusive sessions from botnets are terminated. Hints to keep in mind when you are prompted to be verified through CAPTCHA:  Be sure to read what type of image it is wanting you to select, as that changes through the session. Scroll up and down to see all images. Once you do select the expected images and click Verify, it will then show the Login button on the Login screen and the ""not a robot"" will be pre-selected so that you can now Login. Â  Since Captcha images are controlled by Google Captcha we don't have control over what appears there and the requirement for verification.  CAPTCHA cannot be completely disabled, Â however, the threshold can be set very high so that the customers are not prompted for verification. Contact the Oracle B2C Service team in order to raise the threshold by going to Â Ask Technical Support. Customers who wish to have CAPTCHA required on every form (by default) of their end-user pages, may do so as well by editing the FormSubmit widget to include the challenge-required attribute.  1. Open the page containing the form where you want a CAPTCHA to always appear and locate the code for the FormSubmit widget. 2. Edit the FormSubmit widget code to add the challenge_required attribute. Your edited code will resemble the following.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &lt;rn:widget path=""input/FormSubmit"" label_button=""#rn:msg:CREATE_ACCT_CMD#"" on_success_url=""/app/account/overview"" error_location=""rn_ErrorLocation"" challenge_required=""true"" /&gt; 3. Save the page.  For additional information, refer to the Web Form Security Â section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Web Visit Reporting and Billable Sessions;Answer ID 4057;"What are ""web visits"" and how are they configured?";['Answer ID 10427'];   Customer Portal, Web Visits, Billable Sessions Oracle B2C Service;"  A ""web visit"" is a series of enduser interactions that can span one or more billable sessions. Â  The length of a web visit is configurable and allows an organization to track and report on activities by a single user for up to 12 hours. In earlier Â releases, a billable session is defined as a unit of 15 minutes of enduser activity. Â  Â From the May 2010 release onward, that definition instead refers to any 15-minute period of time within a web visit that contains user activity. Â  This change is an improvement in several important ways:   A visitor who spends more than Â 15 minutes on an Oracle B2C Service site is no longer viewed as multiple visits, and their Â activity is more accurately recorded in analytics. Service agents are now able to view all of the enduser activity for a visitor Â - not just the most recent 15-minute session. Oracle B2C Service Â customers will now be able to configure their web visit length to match the same Â metric in any third-party web analytics tool. Â  (Oracle B2C Service does not guarantee that its web visit statistics will match those of a third-party tool).  Session examples:   A five minute user visit  Â  Â  Â  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Â  Â  Â Result: A single billable session   A twenty minute user visit of uninterrupted activity (one click per minute)  Â  Â  Â  Â  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Result: Two billable sessions   A forty minute user visit with activity at the start, in the middle and at the end (at 0 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes into the visit)  Â  Â  Â  Â  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Result: Three billable sessions   A two hour user visit with activity at the start and end of the visit  Â  Â  Â  Â  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Â  Â  Result: Two billable sessions       Related Configuration Settings      Â Configuration Setting  Notes        Â VISIT_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT  Defines the period of inactivity (in minutes) after which a visit to Customer Portal will expire.    A visit is used to group together the series of activities by a particular visitor to the Customer Portal pages.    A new visit will be generated under following conditions:  - The visitor is inactive for longer than VISIT_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT minutes  - The hard limit defined by VISIT_MAX_TIME is hit  - The browser is closed  - A visitor's browser does not have support for cookies and the visitor navigates away from Customer Portal    The minimum value is 15; Â default is 30.      Â VISIT_MAX_TIME  Defines a hard limit for the length (in minutes) after which a visit to Customer Portal will expire.  A visit is used to group together the series of activities by a particular visitor to the Customer Portal pages.  If a visit extends past the VISIT_MAX_TIME setting, a new visit and corresponding session id will be generated.  The maximum allowed value for this field is 720 minutes (12 hours).  Default is 240 minutes (4 hours).     CP_LOGIN_MAX_TIME  Defines a hard limit for the length of the user login cookie (in minutes). If a visit extends past the CP_LOGIN_MAX_TIME setting, the user will be required to login again. Default value is 0, which means that the login cookie will expire based on user inactivity specified by the CP_LOGIN_COOKIE_EXP configuration setting.     If you have questions around what generates a session and how you can prevent inaccurate session billing on your site please review Demystifying Session Usage (PDF). Some simple mis-steps in customization and configuration can increase billable sessions.  Â For more information, see Â Session usage information."

Resetting Customer Portal to default pages;Answer ID 4058;How can I reset my Customer Portal pages to their default?;['Answer ID 2600', 'Answer ID 2576'];   Customer Portal;  Customer Portal pages within the Development directory can all be replaced with the corresponding OOTB (out of the box) files within the RightNow directory. Â  Â As all folders within the RightNow directory are read-only, these out-of-the-box default pages will always serve as core backups for setting your customized pages back to a non-customized state within the Development folder. Why is this useful?  Custom code may not work correctly.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â -Restoring a page to the defaults can help in the debugging process. Redesigning end-user pages.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â -Many developers require a 'fresh' start to simplify code. Custom Widgets may not work as designed.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - Replacing your custom widget with a standard widget often fixes the issue.  For example, to reset your 'ask.php' page to the default Ask a Question page with standard RightNow templates, widgets, look and feel.  Set up a WebDAV connection. Â  Â For instructions on setting up WebDAV, see the following:  Answer ID 2600: Configuring WebDAV connectin to access Customer Portal   Within the WebDAV client, copy the ask.php file within the euf/rightnow/views/pages directory.   Paste this file into the following Â directory to replace the existing 'ask.php' file.  For CP version 2: 'euf/development/views/pages' For CP version 3: 'cp/core/framework/views'  The above change will be immediately visible within the Development area of Customer Portal administration pages, found at http://[interface_name].custhelp.com/ci/admin.    The next time Customer Portal is deployed, the ask.php page on the end user pages will now display the standard Oracle B2C Service Ask a Question page on the Production pages.   The above process can be repeated for the answers/list.php page, home.php, and all other pages within the Development/RightNow folders. Note: Any changes made to files within the Assets, CodeIgniter, and other folders Â outside of the Development folder Â are NOT able to be reset to the defaults, as no backup for these files is contained within the RightNow directory. Â  Â This would include changes to css, announcements, images, etc. For example, a page may be reset to the default page, but if the css which the page calls was edited, the page may still reflect the old look and feel. If you require these files (Images/CSS/Other/Themes) to Â also be reset to default, please submit a request to Technical Support, to have the current OOTB files for your CP version provided to you per your request. Other actions exist which affect both the Production and Development pages, such as configuration settings, custom reports, and more which must be considered- these are outlined in the following answer: Answer ID 2576: Actions that affect both the production and development pages in Customer Portal .

Web visits;Answer ID 4074;WhatÃ‚Â does the Web Visit tabÃ‚Â reportÃ‚Â on?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Web Visit Tab, Incident Workspace;  You might find it helpful to know what information contacts viewed on the end user pages before they submitted their question. On the Web Visit tab of an incident, you can see what questions they viewed and any searches they performed. In addition, the customerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s source IP address, operating system, and browser information are provided. The 'Web Visit' tab uses the standard report, Incidents Web Visit Tab which pulls data from the 'clickstreams' table. The clickstreams data is populated by the dqa (delayed query aggregator) utility which runs every 15 minutes (at :00, :15, :30 and :45 minutes of each hour). This means that the Web Visit tab should be populated within 15 minutes of the incident creation. Â   Note: Web Visits were previously called Sessions in earlier versions.

Tuning the stopword list;Answer ID 4145;How can my stopword list be optimized to improve search effectiveness?;['Answer ID 2492', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Working with incidents or answers, Stopwords Oracle B2C Service;"  Stopwords are those which are ignored in both indexing and searching. Adding a word to the stopword list for answers or incidents (exclude_answers.txt or exclude_incidents.txt) means that the presence of the word in a search query will have no effect on the result list. Naturally, the stopword list should not include any words that might be useful for finding information. However, if a word has no information value, as with ""the"" or other very common words, there are two benefits to designating it as a stopword. First, by reducing the size of the index (phrases or ans_phrases table), all searches become faster. Second, and more importantly, search result lists become more relevant, as they are no longer contaminated by non-meaningful matches to the designated stopword. Because every organization has its own terminology and uses words in a unique way, the standard stopword lists in the Oracle B2C Service application may not contain all words that are appropriate. For example, if a company makes phones and almost all answers contain the word ""phone,"" then all those answers are at least partial matches to any search query that includes ""phone."" Adding ""phone"" to the stopword list may therefore improve the relevance of search results for many queries. To determine the impact of changes to the stopword list, consult the Keyword Searches report to see what people are actually entering as search queries. If a given word is commonly a component of searches that are returning large numbers of results, then it is a candidate for adding to the stopword list. However, one should be cautious in adding words that searchers use in single-word queries, as these searches will then return zero results, which could be surprising or frustrating. In that case, whether or not the word is added to the stopwords, it may be helpful to create one or more Search Priority Words that have that word as keyword. This ensures that preselected results are always prominent. A good example is a company name, which might appear in many answers, but only one or two answers are most relevant for information about the company itself. The contents of the stopword list can be managed most easily through the Answer Stopwords or Incident Stopwords manager in Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Knowledge Base. This provides a simple interface for adding or removing words, and may also supply suggestions for additions or removals. These suggestions are determined automatically based on word frequencies in answers and incidents, and may or may not be helpful for a particular site; use your best judgment, with reference to the Keyword Searches report. The stopword lists can also be directly edited with the File Manager.  For additional information, refer to the Â 'Add and remove answer stopwords' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Broadcast mailings and survey invitations  Delivery options include daily, weekly, monthly or yearly intervals. Users can specify a date range for the recurrences or set them to run indefinitely. Specific days of the month or specific months of the year can also be specified. Each message can be sent to each contact in your audience only once or with each recurrence. The time of day that the messages will be sent can also be selected by the user.   To add or edit a recurring schedule for a broadcast campaign, survey or mailing:   Open the campaign, survey or mailing.   Click the Delivery Tab.    Â Click the Recurrence button. The Confirm Schedule Recurrence window opens.   Set up desired recurring schedule.   Click the OK button to save the recurrence settings and return to the Delivery tab.   To suspend the recurrence, click the Suspend button.   To exclude contacts from the audience that were included in a previous instance of the recurrence, click the Audience tab and select the Exclude from Audience if Previously Sent check box.    Scheduled Entry Point element for campaigns The new Â Scheduled Entry Point element allows a recurrence pattern to be defined Â for a designated segment of contacts. Â  Once the schedule is in place, a recurring campaign can be edited, suspended or canceled at any time. Three new reports track past recurrences: Recurring Mailings Summary, Recurring Surveys Summary and Â Recurring Campaigns Summary. Note: When you re-schedule a recurring mailing and/or campaign you should not schedule it to send in the same day. Â  For testing purposes it is best to copy the campaign or mailing and then reschedule that copy so that you do not need to wait until the next day for testing results.

Storing additional files and graphics for answers;Answer ID 4161;Can I store additional graphics and files in the images directory for use with our published answers?;['Answer ID 2600'];   Answer Images / Graphics Oracle B2C Service;"  Best Practice As a best practice, we advise you to host your files and graphics on your own web servers and link to that file (through an HTTP address) within your answer content.  Storing in /assets/ directory - Â Not Recommend Note: Â  This method is not recommended because on creation of an upgrade site there should be no changes to the /assets/ folder contents until after cutover. Â  When the upgrade site is created, the current contents of the /assets/ folder is copied. Â  Future changes on production will not be migrated to the update version so files may be missing after cutover. Customers can choose to upload Â images that can be embedded in answers through the /assets/ directory on WebDAV. Each image uploaded in this fashion will get a URL that is addressable. That URL will have the format of http:&lt;site url&gt;/euf/assets/images/*/&lt;filename&gt;.&lt;filetype&gt;. The asterisk represents any sub directories you may create in WebDAV. Important Note: Each Â Oracle B2C Service customer, with a purchase of session transaction blocks, gets an allocation of storage and bandwidth. Storage and bandwidth are for use of the entire solution (including use of the agent desktop, etc.) and are not exclusive to Customer Portal interactions. While customers can, within limits, use these allocations as they wish, storage of images, rich media and other file types on the Â Oracle B2C Service web server will consume both storage (for placement) and bandwidth (for provision). With sufficient size, this Â has Â the potential for taking you out of compliance on contracted allocations. For more information on WebDAV, refer to Answer ID 2600: Configuring WebDAV connection to access the Customer Portal."

Duplicate Criteria in Data Import Wizard;Answer ID 4162;How can I make sure there are no duplicate records when using Data Import Wizard?;['Answer ID 2600'];   Data Import Wizard;"  The Â Data Import Wizard Â has a 'Duplicate Criteria' section. The Duplicate Criteria section of the Data Import Wizard displays the criteria used to prevent instances of redundant records. During the upload process, fields listed in the criteria are compared with existing values in the contacts table in search of duplicate records. When a duplicate is found, action will be taken as specified in the Duplicate Records drop-down menu on the wizard's initial page. For added flexibility, you can define custom criteria by clearing the Use Default check box and entering a logical expression using any combination of mapped fields. For instance, if you want to avoid creating duplicate records with the same last name (mapped to column 1) and user ID (mapped to column 2), you can enter last_name={1} AND login={2}. If column headers have been specified in the data file or header file, you can refer to them by header name instead, such as last_name={Last Name} AND login={User ID}. Note: Â It is important to ensure Â one of two things is true before executing the upload:  The 'Use Default' box should be checked. This will Â  Â add the expression 'any_email={Contact Email} to the 'Criteria' section to ensure the records to be uploaded do not match an existing Â email, email_alt1, and email_alt2) field in the contacts table. If the 'Use Default' box is unchecked, be sure the 'Criteria' box is not left empty, else there is no expression used in checking for duplicate contacts and will result in the contact being inserted into the database with '.0001' appended to the contact's email address. Â  Â Note: Â  Each field in the duplicate criteria must be an Indexed field""."

Techmail-M utility on when queued messages are present.;Answer ID 4168;What is the Techmail-M utility and how can I use it?;['Answer ID 2800'];   Techmail Utility Oracle B2C Service;  The techmail-M utility handles the processing of bounces that are a result of messages sent using Outreach and Feedback. Â  Â  Â If a customer replies to a Outreach or Feedback message, that reply will be processed by techmail-M and turned into an incident. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  If techmail-M is disabled for a specific mailbox, the messages sent to the mailbox address will remain in the mailbox until techmail-M is enabled again. Â  Â Since some messages in the mailbox may have been sent some time ago, you should expect the following:  Any incidents created may contain questions that the customer asked days, weeks or months ago. Â  Â A report can be created to display any incidents created during a specified time frame with a source of Techmail-M so you are aware of what incidents were created. Â  Â You should consider whether or not these incidents should be answered.  Â  Â  Bounces will be processed normally which can result in some messages being delivered again or contact records being marked with an invalid email address. Â  Â Please refer to Â  Â Answer ID 2800: Bounced E-mail message handling in May '09 for more information on how bounces are processed. Â  Â We suggest setting BOUNCE_MAX_RETRIES to 0 before enabling techmail as this will prevent any messages from being sent again. Â  Â If you are a hosted customer, you may submit an incident to Ask Technical Support to have this done. Â  Â Once techmail has finished processing the queued messages, the configuration can be set back to its original value. Â  Â    Any hard bounces that are processed will result in the associated contact record being updated and the email address set to invalid. Â  Â This will not occur if the contact record has had their email address changed since the bounce message was sent. Â  Â Hard bounces are permanent problems with the email address. Â  Â Therefore, invalidating the contact should not cause concern.

Â  Â Event fields are as follows:  chats.termination_event chat_events.event chat_agent_events.event  To become familiar with the chat related event fields and their values, consider generating a simple report that lists the various fields. Note: If you need assistance with creating a specific custom report for your business needs, staff in our Solution Center are able to help. For more information on pricing and options, please contact your sales account manager. From a basic report, you can begin experimenting with adding additional event fields as selection criteria or even chat fields as either search criteria or report output. By keeping the chat created filters to a small date and time range (such as a few hours), you can generally keep the number of records to a comparatively small number to ensure that the custom report is working properly. Expanded database dictionary definitions for chat related event fields are provided in the attached document.

Creating Custom Objects;Answer ID 4185;What can I do with Custom Objects?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 8923'];   Custom Objects, November 2010 and newer Oracle B2C Service;"  Custom Objects can be used to integrate organization-specific data with Â Oracle Â Service Cloud's Â standard objects. You can add custom objects to workspaces, workflows, custom reports, navigation sets, customer portal pages, and other areas of Oracle B2C Service. Note: To create custom objects from a customer portal page, you must have Connect PHP installed. Â  For more information regarding Connect PHP, refer to Connect for PHP.  Creating custom objects When creating a custom object using the Object Designer, you can associate it with other custom objects or with existing tables in the Oracle B2C Service database. For example, if you created a product registration custom object, it could be associated with the Contacts table. You could also create another custom object to track where the product was purchased and then link the custom objects together. Using this scenario, you could track who registered the product and where they purchased it, managing information in a single workspace and displaying it in custom reports. Packages Custom objects are stored in Ã¢â‚¬Å“packagesÃ¢â‚¬Â.  Â Packages are containers where you can place related objects. You can add multiple packages and custom objects in the Object Designer before you deploy them.  To create a custom object   Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. Double-click Object Designer under Database. The Object Designer opens on the content pane. Note The Custom Object Designer permission must be enabled on your profile to access the Object Designer. To create a package for custom objects, follow these steps. a) Click the New button on the ribbon. b) Select Package. c) Type the name you want for the package. Select the package you want to add the custom object to. Click the New button on the ribbon and select Object. The Summary page displays. Type a name for the object in the Name field.   For additional information, refer to the 'Custom Objects Overview' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Â To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.. See also the 'Ask the Experts session: Extending Data Into Your Site' dated January 25, 2018, available from the Oracle B2C Service Webinars page.  Â This webinar focuses on options for adding data points into a site with custom fields and custom objects. This session helps attendees understand the different data types available in the system. Different concepts are Â reviewed such as indexing, relationships, masking and others. It also explores the impact of data and how different data types can impact table sizes as well as best practices to consider. If you would like to engage our Oracle Consulting team for customization with your site, please contact your Sales Account Manager. A vital consideration to keep in mind when deploying a Custom Object is that it is not possible to predict the exact amount of time a deployment will take. A completely normal deployment can take 24 hours or more. If replication is behind (See Answers 5609 &amp; 2817), a deployment cannot complete. As it is possible for replication to be days behind, you should make any necessary changes to Custom Objects at least Â several Â days before they will be needed. Even back-to-back deployments can take Â very different amounts of time to complete, and this is rarely a cause for concern. Â  Â  Additionally, there are certain stages of the deployment where your entire Custom Object table will be locked. While the table is locked, you will be unable to access any Custom Objects; this includes in reports, Â workspaces, the Customer Portal, Â and anywhere else that they are in use.  Â  For more information on deploying custom objects, refer to Answer ID 8923: Custom Objects &amp; Custom Field Deployment Basics."

Configuring Self Service for Facebook;Answer ID 4193;What isÃ‚Â Oracle RightNow Self Service for Facebook Cloud Service and how do I configure it?;['Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2831', 'Answer ID 497', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle RightNow Self Service for Facebook Cloud Service;"  Oracle RightNow Self Service for Facebook Cloud Service Â (formerly known as RightNow CX for Facebook) is a special Facebook application designed to extend core service and community functions from Oracle B2C Service. This gives customers the ability Â to search your knowledge base, submit questions to your Technical Support team, and participate in your community directly Â from your organization's Â Facebook page. Â In this way, you can provide your customers with three types of service: Â   Self-assisted Service - Customers can search and access the same answer content available Â in your knowledge base, and (when using Oracle Cloud Customer Connect Â Community) provide feedback on your content by commenting on and rating answers. Crowd-assisted Service - Customers can share their service experiences with Facebook friends and search and participate in Oracle Cloud Customer Connect Â Community discussions. Agent-assisted Service - Customers can submit questions to your Oracle B2C Service Â application directly from your Facebook page, as well as view and update questions they have submitted. Â   Self Â Service Â for Facebook also provides single sign-on capabilities, allowing Â customers to link their Â  B2C Service contact records to their Facebook accounts. When enabled, Â customers can use Â Self Service Â for Facebook to log into Â their B2C Service account using their Facebook account credentials.   To enable Oracle RightNow Self Service for Facebook Cloud Service  In a web browser, go to https://developers.facebook.com/. Â  Â  Note: These steps must be completed in a workstation web browser. The options below are not available if accessed via a smartphone. Log in using your Facebook account. Note: The configuration of your Self Service for Facebook application is tied to the Facebook account used to configure it. For this reason, you should use an account that has been created specifically to administer the application. This can prevent problems if the staff member who configured the account transfers to another position or leaves your organization. Make sure you have registered as a Developer. To do this click the ""Get Started"" button on the top tight of the page and follow the prompts. If you are already registered as a developer and have an app, hover over Â  Â ""My Apps"" and the top right of the screen and click on ""Add a New App"". This will allow the Developer application permission to access your Facebook profile information. Note: The Developer application is the property of Facebook and its use is subject to FacebookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terms and conditions. Depending on the state of your Facebook account, you may be prompted to confirm your account information in order to add applications. This process is external to Oracle B2C Service.

Click the Add Page Tab button. The application should now be accessible from your Facebook page.    IMPORTANT: Â  Â   Self Service Â for Facebook is available starting with the November 2010 release. If you have email address sharing Â enabled on your site and the customer's Facebook account uses an email address shared by multiple contacts, the oldest contact record will be used on the Ask a Question tab. As of March 30, 2012, Facebook is extending its next-generation Timeline layout to all Facebook pages. If your page uses the Timeline Â feature, we recommend the following adjustments to your configuration: Â     Set your application page size setting to Wide (810px). Â   If necessary, adjust the order of the application buttons that appear on your Facebook page to ensure that the button for your Self Service for Facebook application is prominently displayed, and consider adding a custom icon to replace Facebook's default application icon.   For more information about Timeline, refer to Facebook.com. As of Â October 1, 2011, your Â Oracle B2C Service Â site must be configured with an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate, and the Secure Canvas URL and Secure Tab URL settings must be configured in the Â Self Â Service Â for Facebook application. For information about this requirement, refer to the Â Facebook developer blog. Only contents from B2C Service Community are pulled in. Community Self Service is a different product and contents from this Community Self Service are not able to be displayed.  For more information, contact your Oracle account manager, visit our online documentation.    ADDITIONAL TIPS: Â  Â   You can use the incidents.channel field as a rule criteria for routing incidents to specifically identify and route incidents created from Â Self Â Service Â for Facebook. For example, a condition could be created for 'channel equal to Facebook' and 'incident source equal to Ask a Question'. If necessary, community moderators can escalate questions to the agent desktop for follow up. We recommend that you subscribe to this answer to receive any important updated information as Facebook does often make changes to this functionality. Customers cannot customize their Ask a Question tab Â on Oracle RightNow Self Service for Facebook Cloud Service as this is completely separate from the Ask a Question page on the end-user pages. It is possible to remove the Ask a Question tab from Oracle RightNow Self Service for Facebook Cloud Service by turning off the FACEBOOK_INCIDENTS_ENABLED configuration setting. This will prevent incidents from being submitted via Oracle RightNow Self Service for Facebook Cloud Service."

Outreach Contact Engagement Score;Answer ID 4197;What is the Outreach Contact Engagement Score?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Outreach and Feedback,Ã‚Â November 2010 and newer;  Beginning in Â November 2010, Oracle RightNow Outreach Cloud Service Â evaluates the disposition of contacts for receiving marketing email and assigns each contact a Marketing Engagement Score. This statistic is calculated daily based on each contactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hourly transaction history, such as content viewed, links clicked, web form and survey submittals, marketing emails forwarded, SmartSense ratings, and service transactions. The score value is stored in the ma_scorecard.score field, which is available for reports, segments, campaign decisions, workspaces, workspace and script rules, and workflow connectors.  Outreach transaction data scalability improvements: The Â November 2010 Â release also features more efficient retention and access of marketing transaction data, including faster processing of segments and reports related to Outreach and Feedback transactions. These efficiency improvements are made possible by the following changes.  Data older than 400 days is automatically truncated from the following tables: Marketing Activities (ma_trans), Bounced Messages (bounced_msgs), Mailing Exclusions (exclude_trans), and RNMD Event Log (rnmd_event_log). The Marketing Stats (ma_stats) table summarizes records in the Marketing Activities (ma_trans) table that share a unique combination of mailing_id, format_id, doc_id, flow_id, flow_web_page_id, and type values. This ensures that summary marketing transaction statistics remain available indefinitely, even after the originating ma_trans records have been truncated. All transactions related to unsubscribe, including list-unsubscribe header, feedback loop unsubscribe, and unsubscribe, will remain in the Marketing Activities table.  Two new reports, Mailing Activity Trend and Campaign Activity Trend, have been added to provide access to the new summary data. Also, several existing reports have been updated to draw data from the ma_stats table instead of the ma_trans table. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Campaign Responses Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Sent Email Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Interaction Volume Analysis Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Web Form Conversion Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Transaction Volume Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Campaign Responses Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Survey Link Activity  This release also deprecates a few reports that used the ma_trans table, including the Mailing Response Analysis, Invitation Message Response Analysis, Mailing Delivery Analysis by Media, and Invitation Messages Delivery Analysis by Media reports. In addition, you can now access a new rnmd_event_log table to report on transactions of the mailer daemon (RNMD), such as process start and completion times and errors.  For additional information, refer to the 'Improving conversion rates' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

E-mail Addresses in Chat;Answer ID 4200;Why does Chat include a generic email address for the customer?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Chat - End-user Pages, Customer Portal;" All chats should be launched with some information to identify whether the chat was launched by an existing or new contact. The fields that are available to do this are First Name, Last Name, and Email Address. If a chat is launched without any of this information, the product will automatically designate the chat as having an email address of anonymous@anonymous.invalid. The value of this email address can be changed and it is stored in a message base named ANONYMOUS_AT_ANONYMOUS_INVALID_LBL. In versions November 2009 and later, the Chat pages were redesigned so that they could be customized through Customer Portal. With these changes, new precautions should be made to ensure that contacts cannot launch a chat without required contact information. The standard chat pages are located in WebDav in the app/chat directory. The page names are chat_launch and chat_landing. If you require login to launch a chat, you must ensure that the meta tag includes the login_required = true parameter on both of these pages. If this is only done on the chat_launch page, you will be able to access the chat_landing page directly without logging in and without filling out any required fields. If you do access the app/chat/chat_landing page directly, they will likely create a chat that will be associated to the anonymous@anonymous.invalid contact record. In versions May 2010 and later, additional functionality was added so that you can require specific contact fields to be provided when a chat is launched. If a field is missing, a message will be displayed stating: ""One or more required contact fields are missing. Please review all fields and re-submit the chat request."" The First Name, Last Name and/or Email Address fields can be set to required. This is done when calling the standard ChatServerConnect widget in the chat_landing page code. Simply set the appropriate parameters to true when calling the widget. The name of each parameter is: first_name_required, last_name_required, email_required.  Â   "

Abandon and Restore options in Rules;Answer ID 4231;I made a mistake with my rules. Is there a way to undo my last changes?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Business Rules Oracle B2C Service, all versions;  If you have made a mistake with your rules, you can revert back to the previously active version of rules. If you have edited the rules incorrectly but have not yet activated the rules, you can use the Abandon button (found in the bottom of the Browse Incident Rules panel when the edit rules are open and no individual rule is open). The abandon button clears out the current edit version of rules and puts a copy of the active rules in it's place. This will effectively get rid of any changes that you have made to edit rules since the last rules activation. If you have edited the rules incorrectly and activated the bad set of rules, you can use the Restore button (found in the bottom of the Browse Incident Rules panel when the active rules are open and no individual rule is open). A copy of the version of rules that was active before the currently active rules will be placed in the edit rules. You will have the option to make changes before activating the rules. For example, suppose that Annie Administrator is told to create a rule that assigns all incidents regarding software to Sam and all incidents regarding hardware to Hank. She accidentally creates a series of rules to assign hardware incidents to Sam. Before activating, she notices the problem. The changes were so large that it would be easier to start over from scratch. So she hits the abandon button and the edit rules reset to where they were when she last activated rules. A few days later the rules are ready and Annie activates them. Everything appears to be working correctly. Suddenly she gets a call - there was a miscommunication, and no rules are needed to route software issues to Sam and hardware issues to Hank. In fact, the rules need to be disabled immediately. So Annie opens the active rules and uses the restore button. This takes the set of rules that was active before she added the routing rules and turns them into the edit rules. She reviews the edit rules and verifies that everything is correct, and then activates them. Please note, that we keep three sets of rules available to facilitate easy fallback: the Edit rules, the Active rules and the Archive rules. The Archive rules are the rules that were active just before the currently active set of rules. We only keep the most recent set of Archive rules, so you cannot fall back further that the rules that were active prior to that.

Case Sections;Answer ID 4232;What are case sections?;['Answer ID 1935'];   Mailings, Dynamic Content Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Case Sections can be added to your Outreach and Feedback content. Â  Â Case Sections Â will allow you to show by priority with different sections of content based on if the contact meets that segment criteria. Â  It will specify default content if the contact does match any of the conditional sections above the default in the case. Â  This is less Â confusing when using multiple conditional sections. For example, you could create a case section that displays information to customers based on their location. The first conditional section within the case section might be specific to postal codes. If none match, the next conditional section could be more general, such as states. If neither match, then the default section (if present) would display.   To insert a case section:  Click the Case Section button. The case section displays. Double-click in the Conditional Section header to add your segment. See To insert a conditional section. For more information on Conditional Sections refer to Answer ID 1935: Conditional sections included in mailings If you want to add another conditional statement to your case section, repeat step 2.

Customer Portal Open Login;Answer ID 4237;What is Customer Portal Open Login?;['Answer ID 5304'];   Customer Portal Open Login, February 2011 and newer;"  Beginning in the February 2011 release, Â you can login to Â your end user pages using an account that Â you already have through another identity provider such as Facebook or Twitter. Effectively, this means that you can authenticate into Â your CP pages with Â your Facebook, Twitter or Gmail accounts, or conceivably, with some services assistance, any login that they have with an identity provider that supports Open ID or OpenAuth 2.0 If you are updating a site to the February 2011 release you will not get this feature automatically. Â  Â Once you Â update, Â you will need to copy standard pages containing the new functionality and absorb those pages into Â your CP deployment. Choosing the Identity Provider Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Facebook Example:  Click Facebook button to open the Facebook authentication page (and short description on what is about to happen) Click Login with Facebook button to access the Facebook login page (in the majority of cases) If you are already logged into Facebook but have not made your email address public in the profile, the prompt permissions page will be displayed and the user needs to click Ã¢â‚¬ËœAllowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ We recommend its usage in all but two cases  Case 1: Customers have a user base already with a large number of users with contact records  If the user already has a contact record with you and then you give them the option of logging in with Facebook etc, you are letting them (potentially) create a second account, which they will do if providing a different email address. Â  This fragments your view of individual customers across several contact records. Â  It is recommended that you Â discuss this issue with customers; install base customers who prompt for login prior to allowing the customers to go to an Ask a Question page are recommended to change page flow prior to making this capability available to their consumers.  Case 2: Customers using Householding (Email Address Sharing)  Since every trusted, verified federated login provider is based on the assumption that one email = one user, that is the premise that we in turn must accept. - Â If Â E-Mail sharing is enabled, contact creating and updating is the same. - Â If no contact with the provider-supplied email address exists, then one is created. - Â If any contacts Â with the email address exist, then the first matching contact in the database with that email address is used. - Â Any channel type or openid_accounts rows that are added or updated are associated with that first contact. The same API that is used across the product (contact_match) is used here; so whatever contact is returned by calling contact_match() with the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s email and first and last name (if the first name and last name are provided by the provider) is the contact that is used.  As a result, it is advised Â not to use this feature if Â you use Â E-Mail sharing Â outside of its intended use case (to Ã¢â‚¬ËœversionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ an account for example, with the last contact being the Ã¢â‚¬ËœliveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ customer record)"

The following configuration settings are part of this: SEARCH_USAGE_BOOST - Specifies the amount that answer usage will bias the final search weights, meaning that answers that are more often accessed may come ahead of other answers even if the phrase match is not as high. Higher values for this setting means usage bias will overpower query matching. A value of 0 disables usage boosting. Â  Recommended value is 1. Default is 0. SEARCH_RECENCY_BOOST - Specifies a boost factor for recency of when an answer has been last updated for answer searches. Higher values for this setting means recency bias will overpower query matching. Â  A value of 0 disables recency boosting. Recommended value is 1. Default is 0. This setting also uses ANS_UPD_INC_DURATION as an indicator of recent content. This specifies the number of days that the solved count of updated answers will not be aged (reduced).

Segment Analyzer;Answer ID 4240;What is the segment analyzer?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analyzing a Segment, Adding Segment Filters Oracle B2C Service, Outreach and Feedback, Audiences;  When you create an audience for a Outreach mailing you can break that audience into segments, you can then Â analyze the segment. Â  After you create or edit a segment, we recommend that you run the segment analyzer to check the segmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s database queries. This allows you to fine-tune your segments to ensure they run as quickly and efficiently as possible. The segment analyzer examines your segment and provides suggestions as to how you can improve the segment by removing database tables, adding filters, and making other changes. The analyzer also shows you the estimated number of rows the segmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s query may need to access so you know if the segment can run without encountering row limits. To analyze a segment Â  Â   Open the segment you want to analyze. Click the Analyze button on the ribbonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Home tab. The Segment Analyzer window opens.  The segment analyzer lists the segmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s filters, tables, output levels, and the estimated number of rows the segmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s query will examine when it runs. If the analyzer finds potential issues with the segmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s query, it lists the issues in the Notes column next to the applicable segment component. The following Â describes the four segment components included on the Segment Analyzer window and lists the messages you may see in the Notes column when potential issues are found. Filters -  Â This section lists the expressions used for each segment and level filter and identifies whether the filtersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fields are indexed in the database and whether the index is used. Custom fields can be indexed for faster queries, though too many indexes can slow down queries. Only the following message can be returned in this section. The filter contains a custom field that does not have an index. To improve the performance of this query, consider adding an index on the custom field. Tables Â  - This section lists the tables that are used in the segment, along with the types of joins used to link the data in the tables. Four messages can be returned in this section. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ This table is in an outer join but there are one or more filters on fields in this table. Make sure this is by design. If not, consider changing the join type to inner or changing these filters to join filters to prevent an implicit inner join. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ This table is not used in the report. Consider removing the table from the data set. If you need to filter out rows in the parent table that do not have rows in this table, consider adding a not null filter on the join field in the parent table. Levels Â - This section does not apply to segments even though it displays in the report. Rows This section lists the estimated number of rows that will be examined by the query. Messages are displayed if the number of rows exceeds the threshold values for the operational database and replication server. Three messages can be returned in this section. The messages vary depending on whether your site has a replication server in addition to the operational database. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The estimated number of analyzed rows for this query is X. This value exceeds the threshold of 2,000,000 for the operational database. Consider using the report database for this report. Otherwise, it is likely this will occur automatically. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The estimated number of analyzed rows for this query is X. This value exceeds the threshold of 2,000,000 for the operational database. Since you have specified the operational database for this report, it is unlikely the report will execute. Consider using the replication server for this report. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The estimated number of analyzed rows for this query is X. This value exceeds the threshold of 5,000,000 for the replication server. Consider adding or refining filters to reduce the number of analyzed rows to below this threshold. Otherwise, it is unlikely the report will execute.

Customer Portal 'answers.special_settings' filter;Answer ID 4273;What does theÃ‚Â 'answers.special_settings' filter do to reports in Customer Portal?;['Answer ID 4243']; Ã‚Â   Analytics forÃ‚Â Customer PortalÃ‚Â  Oracle B2C Service, All supported versions;"  Answer reports that are used on the end-user pages normally will have Â this filter: Â  answers.special_settings is null. The special settings filter is a pseudo field that can be added as a report filter. The operator used does not matter. Â The primary purpose of the filter is to restrict visibility of the answers returned by all the different ways we allow visibility: Â  access level, status, product, category, interface, etc.  Status - only answers with a public status type will be returned. Language - only answers associated with the language of the interface being used will be returned Access Level - only the answer with the highest ranked access level per meta-answer that a user has access to will be returned.  For example, you may have one meta-answer configured about support hours for your organization. The one associated with Platinum access says ""We are open all day every day"", the one associated with Gold access says ""You may contact use M-F 8:00-5:00"" and the Silver access says ""You may not contact us"". The access levels are ranked in order: Platinum, Gold, Silver. If a user has access to both Gold and Silver, you  â€™would want only the Gold one displayed.   Product/category end-user visibility - a Â check is done to make sure that answer has to be associated to at least one product and at least one category that are configured to have end-user visibility for the interface where the report is being used. Product/category output columns - each returned answer will only be listed once. So, when the map_cat_lvlX and/or map_prod_lvlX are included as output columns, and an answer has multiple product/categories associated for that level, the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“multipleÃ¢â‚¬Â (internationalized appropriated) will be returned. If there is only one association at that level, that product/category name will be returned. The visibility requirements in the special settings filter are used to select answers for your sitemap. Â  Therefore all end user page reports should have this filter so that your end user pages match what is listed in the sitemap.  There Â will be a Â warning in Â the Customer Portal Â development area if a report Â is referenced Â that pulls from the ""answers"" table Â and it Â does not have the ""answers.special_settings"" filter. Â This warning is meant to bring attention to a condition that warrants investigation. While it technically does not require action (in that omitting this filter will not cause the deployment to fail), please note the design intent is that this filter be included on any report that uses the answers table. Failing to add this filter could result in errors or unexpected search results. Note: Â Always be sure to test publically visible reports in the CP development area first to ensure that the report has the search behavior you desire."

Â  Â Depending on how much your site has been customized, you may need to modify the code on this page to suit your site, namely the template=""standard.php"" part and the div tag id attributes. Â  Â Also, if your site has been customized to have multiple ask pages, e.g. ask2.php, then you will need to make the same changes to each one. Replacing the ask.php page is a five step process. Log into WebDAV for the interface you wish to modify. Â  Â If you do not know how to log into WebDAV, please consult the following answer: Answer ID 2600: Configuring WebDAV connection to access the Customer Portal Â Navigate to this directory: /dav/euf/development/views/pages/ Replace the existing ask.php page with the one of your choosing (such as the attached template page). Â  Â It is best to backup the existing ask.php file somewhere one your own computer instead of on the server so that end-users cannot access the backup page and still submit a question. Test the look and feel in development mode before your end-users see any changes. Â  Â The URL for this is /ci/admin/. Â  Â  Once you are satisfied with the look and feel, you can deploy the development folder to your customer facing production folder so that the new changes become visible to your customers. Â  Â If you do not know how to deploy Customer Portal, please consult the following answer. Answer ID 2849: Deploying Customer Portal pages  Another easy approach to disabling the ask page is backing up the file and deleting it from customer portal all together. Once the file is removed from the development environment, you will need to perform a stage and promote as well to remove it from these environments.  "

Unable to Process Report This query processes too much data. You can reduce the amount of data processed by refining your existing search criteria and/or adding new search criteria to the report definition.;"  If you receive this message, you should reduce the size of the data set being queried. For more information on possible modifications to your report, refer to Answer ID 2380: Improving performance of reports. You can also use the Analyzer button to predict report performance. See below for more information on this option. Borderline reports: It is possible for a report to sporadically give the Query processes too much data message. That is, sometimes the report will generate results, and other times the processing message will display. A report that is close to pulling too much data can be on the threshold for months or years with no problem. Then, one day there may be 1 or 2 more entries in the tables which exceeds the threshold and generates the message until the amount of data decreases again. That is, even though the report has not changed, the size of the database tables are continually increasing in size, including the incidents, contacts, organization, answers and transaction tables. As a result, the report query takes longer to run while processing against larger tables than it did in the past. Cause: When a report first runs, the first thing it does is Â get an estimate of Â the amount of data it will need to process Â all the data it must scan through in order return the actual results. This pre-scan Â estimate is in place as a safety check to protect your database and ensure consistent and reliable response time from the database. Â  Also in order to find the data that you are looking for, the database must scan more rows than are returned.  For example, Â when looking up a name in a phone book, you don't read the name you want first, you open the phone book to the appropriate part and then start spot checking names to see if you need to jump forward or backward. Â  Â The database works in a similar manner, and this estimate is an estimate of the number of rows it must scan, not the number of rows returned.  If the pre-scan is determined to be too large then you will receive an informational message that the report processed too much data and that you must add more filters to reduce the scan of the report so that it can run. Database row thresholds determine the maximum number of database rows that can be analyzed to return a result set that will be displayed in a report. There are different thresholds (also known Â as the max join size) for different databases. The same thresholds are used when a report is run from any part of the product, including Â the end-user pages in customer portal and Â via Â one of the Connect APIs. The amount that is allowed by the pre-scan when a report is run from the Reports Explorer is determined by three Â possible settings. Â If the report is on the operational database or replication server and/or if the report is deferred.  Deferred - 200,000 Operation database - 2,000,000 Replication server - 5,000,000 Note: These are mandatory settings and cannot be changed.   Analyze tool: Â  An estimate of these scans can be seen by opening the report for edit and selecting the Analyze button from the Home ribbon. Â  Refer to Answer ID 2844: Using the report analyzer with custom reports Â for information on this option. Â  With the analyze option, you may also see some recommendations on things that can be done to improve a report's performance. Data Source: The database that a report uses can be changed by opening the report for edit and selecting Options &gt; More Options, from the Home ribbon.  Replication server: The replication server is an exact copy of your operational database but it is designed to handle reports that are too large to run off the operational database. Because of this, there are times when it may fall behind. As an example, the replication server should be used for large historical reports, such as Incidents by Product for Â past 3 months, which is Â a report of all the incidents that an agent had worked in the past 3 Â months. Operational database: We recommend the Operational database be used if you need up to the minute data on a small report. For example, My incidents or My Inbox, which Â are reports that show Â agents all of their current unresolved incidents.  For more information regarding these data sources, refer to Answer ID 5609: Information on different database types used for reporting."

Spider bot;Answer ID 4280;Why am I seeing an unusually high number of sessions?;['Answer ID 9693', 'Answer ID 10427'];   Web crawler,Ã‚Â Spider bots, Web Indexing;"  A Web crawler or spider, Â is a computer program that browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner or in an orderly fashion. Many sites, in particular search engines, use spidering as a means of providing up-to-date data. Â  Web crawlers typically identify themselves to a Web server by using the User-agent field of an HTTP request. For example: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; bingbot/2.0; +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm) The user-agents of many web spiders for search engines are often known and do not show up in session data. Â  Â However, there are times when a new web spider is created that is not in the Oracle B2C Service system. In these cases, to prevent future activity from being counted in your session data, it is recommended that you add the user-agent sub-string to the configuration setting - SEC_SPIDER_USER_AGENT. Generally, when you see dramatic spikes of traffic data, it is due to your site being accessed by a spider. Spiders, also known as robots, are automated searching utilities that come in many varieties, from search engine indexers to email address harvester scripts. For details on how to observe site activity see Answer 9693: How to understand and investigate site activity. In the above example the user-agent sub-string is ""bingbot"". Web spiders usually have a unique name in the user agent that often includes ""bot"" or ""spider"". Do not add generic strings Â such as ""gecko"", ""mozilla"", or ""applewebkit"" as these terms are used in most user agents which will cause end user page reporting to be impacted significantly. The SEC_SPIDER_USER_AGENT configuration setting defines custom User-agents that are known web spiders. Valid entries include a comma-separated list of User-agent sub-strings (For example: bingbot,MyCustomSpider,InternalGoogle - no space Â between entries). Â Browsers supplying this User-agent will not experience different behavior on end-user pages and will be considered a web spider for statistics collection. Â Default is blank.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  If you have questions around what generates a session and how you can prevent inaccurate session billing on your site please review Demystifying Session Usage (PDF). Some simple mis-steps in customization and configuration can increase billable sessions.  Â For more information, see Â Session usage information."

Syndicated Polling Widget;Answer ID 4293;What is the Syndicated Polling Widget?;['Answer ID 7934'];   Syndicated Polling Widget Oracle B2C Service,Ã‚Â May 2011 and newer;  Beginning in May 2011 release, you can Â add the ability to create single question surveys (a poll) on Customer Portal pages or to syndicate those questions to external sites, especially high traffic customer pages. This Â feature will leverage the customer portal syndicated widget framework to create a one question polling survey that can be added to any page on the web. This Â will give you Â the ability to create a widget that will ask a question, then on submit, show either the results for that question or show a thank you message. This will enable the feedback product to have a presence outside of the basic survey functionality. The widget is the end-user facing poll appearing on the customer's web site. The appearance of the widget Â is completely customizable via CP CSS (Customer Portal Cascading Style Sheets) and attributes as well as the question editor. Â  You can add charts to the poll results. Examples:  Results Display as: Â   To create a survey poll from the Agent console:  Select the Â Surveys tab Â from the Navigation set, then Â choose the Surveys Explorer, select New from the ribbon at the top.

Custom Widgets used with Standard Widgets;Answer ID 4294;Why do my custom widgets break when I use standard widgets?;['Answer ID 7934'];   Custom/Standard Widgets Customer Portal (CP);"  There may be a possible collision with custom widgets and standard widgets of the same name being referenced on a single page. Â  Â  You cannot have two different widgets referenced on a single page that have the same folder name for the widget (which means the two widgets have the same class name in the controller). That is, if you copy a widget and use the same name for the custom widget and if the copied widget uses the custom controller, the class value in the custom controller matches the class name in the standard controller. In this situation, you cannot include the standard widget and the custom widget on the same page. This tends to Â happen with custom composite widgets. For example, a custom composite widget references a custom widget such as ""FormInput"" or ""FormSubmit"". If that custom composite widget is put on a page that also uses the standard FormInput or FormSubmit, it will result in the case where the standard widget and a custom widget of the same name is referenced from a single page."

Difference between dormant, archived and purge delete incidents settings;Answer ID 4316;What is the difference between dormant incidents, archived incidents, and purge delete incidents settings?;['Answer ID 10293', 'Answer ID 5461'];   Archiving, Dormant, PurgingÃ‚Â  Oracle B2C Service, all versions;"  Dormant Incidents Dormant incidents are not Â the same Â as archived incidents. Â  Â Dormant incidents are regular service incidents that go dormant. Â  Â The configuration DORMANT_INCIDENTS represents the number of days after an incident is in a solved state until agedatabase will put it in a dormant status. Â  Â By default, this configuration is set to 0 which is disabled. Â  Â This configuration runs off of the incidents.closed date to determine when it should set the incident to dormant. Â  Â When an incident becomes dormant, the incidents.dormant and phrases.dormant fields get set to true. Â  Â What this means is that when you search for that incident via the console, it won't show up in your search results. Â  Â An update to a dormant incident makes it become un-dormant. The path to edit this setting is: Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; search by Key.  Archived Incidents Â  Archived incidents are incidents that have been removed from your database and are no longer editable. Â  Archived incident information is read-only and cannot be updated. In addition, you must perform a search to display archived incidents and they can only be viewed through the Open the Archived Incidents component. Until the 18B release, archived incidents Â are represented by the following configuration setting:  ARCHIVE_INCIDENTS Specifies the number of days after which solved incidents will be archived. Set this value to 0 or to a value greater than PURGE_DELETE_INCIDENTS to disable this feature. Default is 365 (1 year). This value represents the amount of days after the incidents.closed date until an incident becomes qualified to be archived by the agedatabase utility.  Â   Beginning in the August 2012 release until 18B, the ARCHIVE_INCIDENTS configuration setting Â was made Â visible to the Configuration Editor. Â  Â You can edit the Â configuration setting by going to Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key. For sites older than August 2012, in order to enable archiving on an interface, you must provide the Â Technical Support Â team the number of days after an incident is solved that you would like to set for it to be archived by submitting an incident to Ask Technical Support. We will update this configuration for you as well as Â turn on the archiving automated process. Â  Â Keep in mind that when you set this configuration, the timeframe becomes a sliding window. Â  Â  Beginning from 18B release, the archive incidents configuration is moved to Data Lifecycle Policies component in Browser Agent where customers can configure the days after which solved incidents are archived. The configuration is site specific and not interface specific. Refer to the user documentation here. Â  Note:  An incident must be in a solved state to be archived which then writes the incidents.closed date used by agedatabase. Once an incident is archived, it cannot be undone.  Archived incidents can also be purged if needed. Â  The PURGE_ARCHIVED_INCIDENTS setting specifies when archived incidents will be deleted from the archive. Â  For more information, see 'Archiving incidents automatically' in online documentation.  Purge Delete Incidents Prior to the 18B release, PURGE_DELETE_INCIDENTS Â represents the number of days after an incident is solved that it is permanently deleted from the database. Â This configuration is set to zero (0) by default which will never be deleted from the database. This setting can be edited at Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; search by Key. Beginning with the 18B release, the incident purge functionality has been moved to the Data Lifecycle Policy in the Browser Agent where customers can view, enable and configure data lifecycle settings.  Â Refer to the user documentation here.  Â  Â Data Lifecycle Policy honors relationships of custom objects. Â Objects that have an aggregation relationship will be deleted when the parent object relationship is deleted. Â  Note:  Â Keep in mind that this is irreversible!  Â Once an incident is deleted, it cannot be retrieved. For more information on configuring incident purging on a site, refer to Answer ID 5461: Configuring incident purging on an established site.  Handling of File Attachments File attachments are stored in a separate location from incident records. They are accessed via links. The table below describes the status of file attachments and whether file attachments are accessible.        Incident State      File Attachment Status         Active      Live Link - Â  accessible         Dormant      Live Link Ã¢â‚¬â€œ accessible         Archived      Live-Link Ã¢â‚¬â€œ accessible via Archived Incident Viewer-Details tab         Purged via Data LifeCycle Management Policy      Link Destroyed, file removed from server Â         NOTE: Each of the settings above works based on the incidents.closed setting and the incident Â being in a solved state. Â  Â Since they all work off of this field, Â there can be some unintended overlap. Â  Â  For example, if you set the incident purge period less than the archive incident period or DORMANT_INCIDENTS setting, this will cause incidents to be deleted and never hit the other settings.  Â The same is true of any of these combinations.  Â If archive incidents period is set less than DORMANT_INCIDENTS or purge incidents period, this will cause incidents to be archived and never hit the other settings. Also note that purging of incidents only works off incidents within the database. Because archived incidents are removed and placed into the archive console, they are no longer part of the database and therefore, this setting does not apply to archived incidents. Â  Â However, if you wish to purge archived incidents, you can enable the PURGE_ARCHIVED_INCIDENTS setting. Most organizations will never purge incidents and will Â set the DORMANT_INCIDENTS to a smaller value than archive incidents period so an incident will go dormant before it is eventually Â archived. Â  Â The equation that can be used to represent whether any of these configurations (assuming they are turned on) will become candidates is the following: CANDIDATE = [incident in solved state] + [incidents.closed &lt; (Today's date - configuration)]."

Adding a Staff Profile;Answer ID 4352;How do I add a Staff Profile?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Staff Account Profiles Oracle B2C Service, all versions;"  Profiles define the amount of access staff members have to administrative components in your Oracle B2C Service application. Administrators can define specific profiles for staff members to allow greater flexibility in defining who has access to specific types of records, analytics, and administrative features and to specific interfaces. When creating new profiles, it is possible to create profiles that allow access to features that you may not have access to yourself. However, when creating staff accounts, you can only assign profiles with features that you yourself have access to.

Web Content Accessibility;Answer ID 4368;Does Oracle B2C Service (RightNow) conform with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) guidelines?;['Answer ID 1731'];  Oracle B2C Service, Accessibility;" The Oracle Accessibility Program guidelines are based on the Section 508 standards (in effect as of June, 2001), and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) at the 'AA' level, initially version 1.0 and most recently version 2.0. Oracle is committed to developing new products in conformance with the newer WCAG 2.0 standards to the extent practicable; as new products and revisions are released that conform to the WCAG 2.0 standards, we will publish Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates (VPATs) that also include a table of all of the WCAG 2.0 'A' and 'AA' standards, in addition to the current Section 508 standards. For VPATs that do not yet contain that additional table, you may use information from the U.S. Access Board and the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to assess the degree of conformance with WCAG 2.0 that our products may already exhibit. Before formally adopting all of WCAG 2.0 'AA' standards, Oracle already used extensive success criteria from WCAG 2.0, where there was an obvious mapping from Section 508 or WCAG 1.0, such as the 4.5:1 color luminosity contrast for text, and much of this detail is typically reflected in our VPATs. Although the WAI states that many sites that already meet WCAG 1.0 will require little or no changes to meet WCAG 2.0, Oracle has not yet performed this evaluation and is unable to make a formal statement of conformance to WCAG 2.0 until such time as new VPATs are released. In certain cases, most notably WCAG 2.0 standards #1.3.1 and #4.1.2, we know that additional coding may be required because Oracle had not fully incorporated these new standards into prior guidelines."

WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) administration feature deprecation;Answer ID 4379;Why is the WAP administration feature being deprecated?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), February 2012;"  Starting in February 2012 release, the Oracle B2C Service Agent Wireless Administration Interface will be removed. Â  Â WAP support for end user pages will be removed in February 2016. Â  The ""Basic"" pages, introduced in May 2013, are the perfect solution for replacing older WAP implementations. Â  Â For additional information on the Basic pageset or to submit a question, refer to the Â CP: Pageset Basic Â discussion in the Customer Portal Forum. Additional information for Basic page set, can be found in the 'Basic Page Set for the Customer Portal' section in online documentation for the version your site is running. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.  All the functionality currently exists in the Oracle B2C Service Contact Center Agent Desktop and the Accessibility Interface, and these interfaces include functionality far exceeding the WAP interface. You are already using the Agent Desktop to perform these functions, so this represents more business as usual for the majority of our clients. As an existing client, you will not have to take any action or perform any reconfiguration as a result of this feature removal. You simply use the other access methods to manage incidents. This does not impact Oracle B2C Service's continued support of the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) functionality for end users. The only change is the removal of the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) for agents. Starting in February 2012, WAP incident management for agents will be removed. Â  You can no longer view notifications, manage incidents, view reports, Â or search reference numbers. Why is WAP Admin being removed?  Oracle B2C Service listens to clients, and focuses resources based on client demands. Â  Â Oracle B2C Service has considered our client's usage pattern and has learned that clients do not value the WAP Admin function. Â  Â Due to the cost of maintaining this functionality and the desires of our clients to have more rich mobile functionality, Oracle B2C Service is removing this rarely used feature in favor of other development efforts.  What other methods are available to perform these functions?  The Agent Console has all the administrative functionality provided through WAP Admin. Â  Â The Accessibility Interface also has duplicative features. Â  Â There are more feature rich interfaces available, and these are the primary means to manage incidents for a majority of the Oracle B2C Service client base. Â  Â   What does this mean for my existing use of WAP Admin?  If you currently use WAP Admin, you should begin investigating using the .NET client. Â  Â WAP Admin will no longer be available in new releases after February 2012, so we encourage you to get started soon on your effort of using the .NET client."

"""The server and client clocks are no longer synchronized"" or ""Request time not within range.""";Answer ID 4385;I keep getting one of the above error messages.Ã‚Â  What causes this and how can I fix it?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Oracle B2C Service, Environmental;" The Oracle B2C Service software has a number of security features. One of the security features is the time offset value. Error messages such as: ""Unable to communicate with server"", ""Request time not within range"" or ""The server and client clocks are no longer synchronized"" ...may indicate there is a problem with the time changing on the affected workstation. When logging into the Oracle B2C Service console, this security feature notes the time on the client workstation and compares it to the time on the Oracle B2C Service application server. This time difference is stored in the time_offset column of the accounts table for each account. Each subsequent transaction that the client submits to the server is compared to this time-offset value. If the client time changes by more than the allowed offset value (plus or minus 120 seconds) the transaction is not valid and the Â error message is returned. When a single workstation receives this error message, consider the following possible causes: The system clock on the workstation is losing or gaining time suddenly. This can be attributed to a bad CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) Â  Â battery and or issues occurring when it is synchronizing to a time server. Checking and replacing the CMOS battery is recommended. The average lifespan of a lithium CMOS battery is about three years. Workstations purchased in bulk, may need to have the CMOS batteries replaced. The Â computer is losing its network connection sporadically. While there are a number of possible causes for this, don't forget to check the physical network connections. Check the network cable for loose wiring or a loose plug. Check the cable for pinching or sharp bends or kinks. Replace suspect cables. When numerous workstations are receiving this error message, consider the following possible causes: If synced to a local time server, check that servers CMOS battery, it may be failing. A local time server with a failing CMOS battery can reset the workstation time to an incorrect value. Check for a bulk purchase of workstation or workstations of similar age. Check and replace the CMOS batteries if failing or are three years or older. Check for sporadic network connections. Notes: The time security feature is built into the Oracle B2C Service software. This feature cannot be turned off or altered. Some screen savers have been shown to affect the workstations clock. If the error is routinely received after the workstation has been locked, check the screen saver as a possible cause."

sum() vs count() functions;Answer ID 4417;When do I want to use the sum() function and when do I want to use count() function?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Functions;  The count() aggregate function is used for counting the number of items (think number of items). The sum() aggregate function is used for summing up items (think mathematical addition). For example, we have two incidents who's i_id's are 100, and 101.  COUNT: The result of the Â expression count(incidents.i_id) Â be 2. SUM: Â  Â If we use Â sum(incidents.i_id), the result would be 201, as it would sum the numbers 100 + 101.  There may be times when you want to know how many incidents a contact has. In those cases you would want to use the count() function. One example where sum() would come in handy would be with the stats table.   The stats table collects data on an hourly basis so you may have data for sessions of:      Â stat_date   Â sessions        Â 12:00   Â 500      Â 13:00   Â 600      Â 14:00   Â 500     You would not want to use count() to get your total sessions because you would end up with 3, as there are 3 records in our example. In this case you would want to use sum(stats.sessions). Â  The sum of the sessions for three hours would be 1600 (500 + 600 + 500).

We are noticing that less customers are viewing their emails;Answer ID 4448;"Less of ourÃ‚Â customers are reading their emails; are there settings that may be causing this?";['Answer ID 2205'];   Outreach -Ã‚Â Broadcast Mailings;"  Less readers viewing their emails: To answer this question, let us first start out by telling how email 'open' tracking is accomplished. In your HTML mailings that are sent out, a single 1x1 pixel is attached to the sent mailing. Â  Â When the end user opens this email, then the Oracle B2C Service server is reached and that single pixel graphic is requested. Â  Â Now we know that our end user has opened the email, as the graphic has been accessed. This tracking can be hampered by customers that choose to not load pictures when opening an email, or by email applications that block graphics contained within emails. In your Text mailings, there is no way to add this pixel, and so the 'open' is only tracked if a customer follows a specific link in the mailing. Â  Â Here, we are assuming that since our client has followed the link, they must have opened the email. Oracle B2C Service does not have the ability to track an email after it has been handed off to the recipient's server; except for when the pixel is loaded, or a link is clicked. Â  Â This means that if your readers are not loading the HTML graphics, then the Email will be delivered but not opened.

Answer stats do not seem to be updating;Answer ID 4449;My Answer stats numbers shown via the reports do not seem to be incrementing when I mark an answer as effective or ineffective.;['Answer ID 348'];  Analytics / DQA; If you are attempting to access the information immediately after rating an answer you won't see any activity right away on your report. The clickstreams table stores all end-user activity including when an answer is viewed and how it was rated. The dataminer utility runs hourly Â and takes the session information from the clickstreams table to populate the ans_stats table. The utility will then compile the information. The compiled information is deferred four hours, meaning that compiled data will be four hours behind the time dataminer runs. Â  For information on all other utilities, refer to Answer ID 348: Utilities included with Oracle B2C Service.

Automatically assign incidents from a contact to the same account every time;Answer ID 4455;How do you assign incoming incidents to the same account that handled the previous incidentÃ‚Â for this customer?;['Answer ID 348'];  Incidents, Business Rules;" One way to enact this would be to create a custom_field in the contact information and have business rules fire off of that field. Create a custom field in your contacts record (e.g.: 'preferred_agent') Make contact.c$preferred_agent visible and editable in your Agent's Contact workspace. When an Agent works on an Incident from a contact for the first time, they go into the Contact's information and fill out the preferred_agent field with their name/ID/etc. Create a Business rule for each Agent Â that says ""IF contacts preferred_agent EQUALS ""rob"" THEN assign Incident to Rob.  Notes: You will be unable to really filter based on ""skillset"" unless you add in products/categories to the rule. If Agent goes on vacation, then you would either need to manually turn off the rule for that Agent, or have someone assigned to monitor that agent's queue. Note: Â If you do want to filter Â on an Agent's skillset, then you could add the Products/Category field to the Rule. Â  For example, Rob is very good at Chat queries, but still needs to train for workspace issues. Knowing this, we can add an AND to the IF that specifies the specific categories and/or products that Rob is able to handle. Â  If the product or category is one which Rob is not familiar, then we can put the Incident into a generic queue, to be pulled by an Agent experienced in that particular area. Now your rule would look similar to this: IF Contact. Preferred Agent equals Rob AND Category equals Chat, THEN Assign Incident To Rob, ELSE Assign Queue ""Generic Queue"""

Visual Email Editor;Answer ID 4466;What is the Visual Email Editor?;['Answer ID 5169'];  Workspace Thread Control;" Visual Email gives you the ability to send and receive rich text emails. Â  Beginning in the November 2011 release Â you can display, edit and respond to HTML-formatted emails which will enhance the experience for your customers. Sites upgrading from a previous version must enable the configuration verb Â EGW_VISUAL_EMAIL. Â This will enable techmail to accept HTML content in incoming email data. Â  New sites do not have to enable this configuration verb. Â  Path to edit setting: 1. Select Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings 2. Click RightNow Common 3. EGW_VISUAL_EMAIL is located under category Service Modules Â &gt; RightNow Email In addition, if you are upgrading your site you must make sure your incident workspace has the new control: Make sure your profile is set to use the workspace where you enabled the Rich Text editor. You can insert images into an incident. Images are stored in the file attachments table. There are 3 ways of inserting images: Copy Â and Paste images Image by URL Upload an image  With the new visual email you will see a new toolbar, similar to the one in Â answers: This enables you to change the font, the font Â size, bold the font, copy and paste, undo, and many other options seen above.

Knowledge Base Actionable Reports;Answer ID 4467;What new reports are available for the Knowledge base?;['Answer ID 8703'];   Analytics, Answers, Knowledge Foundation;"  Beginning in the November 2011 release there are knowledge foundation actionable reports added to help analyze answers for knowledge base maintenance purposes. The reports are available at Public Reports &gt; Service &gt; Site Reports &gt; Actionable Knowledge Foundation ...and are categorized by answers, escalations, pages and actions, referrers, and searches. An Analytics tab is now available on the standard answer workspace to display reports about the answer being viewed or edited. The reports provide details about how contacts interact with a given answer on the customer portal. By reviewing the reports on the Analytics tab, you can learn how your knowledge base is being used and make the necessary adjustments to improve customer satisfaction. The Analytics tab contains a toolbar for performing actions on the reports. Three tabs are located under the toolbar: the Descriptions tab provides descriptions for the reports, whereas the Summary and Top 10 tabs display the reports.  By default, the Summary tab opens and displays the following reports.  Answer UsageÃ¢â‚¬â€This report provides contact usage details on a per-answer basis. Answer Click-through RateÃ¢â‚¬â€This report provides a list of customer portal pages and actions and details about the visits for each. Answer EffectivenessÃ¢â‚¬â€This report provides details about the actions performed on individual answers to provide an overall assessment of how effective each answer is. Escalation Details per AnswerÃ¢â‚¬â€This report provides information about the escalations that occurred  The Top 10 tab displays the following reports:  Top Searches per AnswerÃ¢â‚¬â€This report provides the top ten searches that returned a an answer which was viewed by a contact. Top Previous Answers by AnswerÃ¢â‚¬â€This report provides a list of answers viewed during a selected time period, along with the top ten answers that were most often viewed previous to that time period. Answer ReferrersÃ¢â‚¬â€This report provides the domain names (www.example.com) that visitors arrive from and the number of times (visits) a given answer was viewed by individuals from those domains. Top Next Answers by AnswerÃ¢â‚¬â€This report provides a list of answers viewed during a selected time period, along with the top ten answers that were most often viewed after that time period.  Most of the new tables are aggregated regularly into windows. Meaning, the data is 'rolled up' into specific time periods.  Â Windows are hourly, daily, monthly, yearly. When the end of a roll up window is reached, all of the data for that time frame is condensed into a single summery row of data. Roll ups are used in order to reduce the size of a siteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s database.  Â There is no overlap of data in windows. As an example, once data has been rolled up to monthly, no data will exist daily.  Â Once it has been rolled up yearly, no data will exist for daily or monthly. For more information on roll up windows, refer to Â Report is missing older data.  "

Custom report always queues now, when it has not in the past;Answer ID 4493;Why is my report now always queuing when it has never done this before?;['Answer ID 4278', 'Answer ID 5094'];  Custom Reports Analytics, All supported versions;" Many times the reason that Â a custom report will try to Â queue Â every time that it is run is because the report has been set to deferred execution. This will drastically increase the reports likelihood to be queued. Please note, a report set to deferred execution will not force a report to queue, but will increase the likelihood that it will ask to be queued. A report can become deferred in a couple of ways: 1. If a report takes longer than 60 seconds to run, the report will get set to deferred execution. This happens most often when someone has run the report in a way that takes too long to run. 2. Someone has manually edited the report and selected the option to ""Set report to deferred execution.""  To Â check if your report is set to deferred execution: Open your report in Edit mode. Click the Options button located in the Properties section of the Home tab. Click ""More Options..."" Uncheck ""Set report to deferred execution."" Click OK and save the report.  If the report runs without needing to be queued, then you have resolved the issue. Please note, if another agent runs the report at a different time with a larger filter range it may take over 60 seconds for the report to run. This will cause the report to become deferred again. It is not possible to adjust or configure this setting. If running the report with your default filters takes longer than 60 seconds to run, the report will become deferred again. In that case, you will need to let the report queue as it is taking too much time to be processed. Additional filters may help the report to run more efficiently. For more information on reports processing too much data, refer to Answer ID 4278: Report query processes too much data. For information on modifying the deferred or data source options for standard reports, refer to Answer ID 5094: Standard report is queuing."

When to index a custom field;Answer ID 4494;I am adding a custom field to my database. How do I know whether I should index this field or not?;['Answer ID 1266'];  Custom Field Indexing; A database index is a feature that improves the speed of data retrieval filtered on a specific database column at the cost of more expensive updates to the field. In general, a field that will be selected frequently and updated infrequently should be indexed. For example, a custom field for a contactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s date of birth would be best to have indexed because their date of birth never changes, plus an index would help speed up queries where you filter on the date of birth. Conversely, a field that will be updated frequently should not be indexed. For example, a custom field for a contactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last login date should not be indexed, because the Â index would Â slow write operations Â and could cause unnecessary load if Â modifications were made Â many times a day. For more information on the impacts of indexing custom fields please review Answer ID 1266: Impact of indexing a custom field

Transactional Survey Incorrectly Sending;Answer ID 4541;Why are my surveys that are built to send when an incident has been solved for a certain amount of time sending even though the incident status has changed from solved?;['Answer ID 2015', 'Answer ID 2495', 'Answer ID 2506'];  Rules, Surveys; Rules only check an incident when it is first run through the rule-set. Â  Â If an incident meets all of the requirements, and then is transitioned to a certain queue, it will stay in that queue regardless of if the incident status changes since rules do not revalidate after the initial test. The best practice to avoid this is to create an escalation rule, as you can setup these to revalidate after a set amount of time. Example: 1. Create an escalation rule that says if incident.status is equal to solved, then escalate in two days 2. On that escalation rule, Â check the Revalidate box 3. After 2 days, the Revalidate will check if the incident is still solved 4. Create another rule will send the transactional survey immediately  Â  Notes: For further information on Revalidate please view the following answer: Answer ID 2015: Using Response Interval, Revalidate, and Recalculate boxes with rules For further information on creating and configuring transactional surveys, please view the following answers: Answer ID 2495: Creating rules for transactional surveys Answer ID 2506: Configuring transactional surveys

Incidents are not being updated with a customer reply (Service and/or Outreach);Answer ID 4543;Why are my Outreach or Service incidents not being updated when a customer replies by email?;['Answer ID 331'];   Incoming Email, Related Configuration Settings;"  Step one is to ensure that your mailboxes have been configured properly. Â  Double check the pop account information, the password, and that Incoming email is enabled. To start with, see: Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service Â - remember, this will need to be performed in each interface. After you are sure that the mailbox(es) have been setup correctly, we need to make sure that Email processing has been enabled. Make sure the EGW_ENABLED configuration setting is set to ""Yes"" or incoming emails will not even be processed.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  There are many other Email Gateway (EGW_) settings that can affect your mailbox's usage, below are just a few: EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE If enabled (Yes), a new contact record is created when an email message in a service mailbox is processed which contains an email address that does not already exist in a contact record in the database. The contact record will be populated with the contact's email address as well as the contact's first and last names if they can be extracted from the email headers. If the first and last names cannot be extracted, EGW_DEFAULT_FIRST_NAME and EGW_DEFAULT_LAST_NAME will be used. The user ID for the contact will be set to the contact's email address, and the password will be set based on how the EGW_PASSWD_CREATE setting is configured. Â  Default is enabled (Yes). Note: This setting does not apply to Outreach/Feedback mailboxes.  EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE_MA If enabled, a new contact record is created when an email message in an Outreach mailbox is processed which contains an email address that does not already exist in a contact record in the database. The contact record will be populated with the contact's email address as well as the contact's first and last names if they can be extracted from the email headers. If the first and last names cannot be extracted, EGW_DEFAULT_FIRST_NAME and EGW_DEFAULT_LAST_NAME will be used. The user ID for the contact will be set to the contact's email address, and the password will be set based on how the EGW_PASSWD_CREATE setting is configured. Default is enabled (Yes).  EGW_PASSWD_CREATE Determines if techmail should create a password when creating a new contact. If enabled, a password will be generated for the new contact but the contact will be required to manually reset the password in order to log in to the end-user pages. A message with instructions and a link to a password setup page will be emailed to the new contact. Default is enabled (Yes). Note: If EU_CUST_PASSWD_ENABLED is set to No, this setting will be ignored, and a password will not be created.  EGW_SAVE_ORIG_MESSAGE If enabled, the Email Gateway program will attach the original email to each new incident upon creation. Default is Enabled (Yes).  EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_MODE NOTE: Â  Beginning in 17D: The EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED configuration setting as been renamed to EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_MODE. Â  This setting determines the level of security applied when updating an incident by email.  Supported values are: 2 - Updating an incident by email is allowed only when the Reply-to or From address of the email message is listed in the contact record associated with the incident. 1 - Updating an incident by email is allowed from any email address, but only if the new message includes a tracking string indicating a match to the site and incident in question. (Note that if  Â no tracking information is found but a ref_no is found in the subject, then an incident will be created if EGW_UPDATE_BY_CREATE is set to 1). 0 - Updating an incident by email is allowed from any email address based on reference number match only. IMPORTANT! SETTING THIS VALUE TO 0 MAY IMPACT SECURITY OR PRIVACY CONCERNS FOR YOUR SITE.  *Note a setting of 0 allows an incident to be updated by as little as a reference number match in the subject. Because of this, a contact other than the original incident's contact can update the incident. In August 2017 and earlier: Â  If enabled, updating an incident by email is allowed only when the Reply-to or From address of the email message is listed in the contact record associated with the incident (that is, the primary or alternate email addresses). If disabled, an incident can be updated by email from any email address. Default is enabled (Yes).  EGW_UPDATE_BY_CREATE If enabled (Yes), a new incident is created when an incident update request is received by email from an address that does not belong to the incident's primary contact and EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED is enabled. If disabled (No), the update is discarded and a rejection notice is returned to the sender. This setting has no effect if EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED is disabled (No)."

Unable to deploy Custom Object;Answer ID 4544;We are unable to deploy custom objects due to 'indexes' error.

Cause: This message occurs because the modifications Â you are implementing ADDS to the indexes that are already existing in your system for that particular table. The addition of your indexed field(s) in the object pushes the indexes over the maximum allowed. You can define up to 30 Â indices per custom object and up to 25 for standard objects. Please note, custom fields and system attributes are included in the standard object schema so the limit is cumulative. For example, if you index incident system attributes Â and create additional custom fields which are also Â indexed, this total number of indexes cannot exceed 25 for the table.  "

Incident response transaction not reflected in thread;Answer ID 4545;Why are we seeing a Response Sent transaction, but not a corresponding Response thread entry for an incident?;['Answer ID 2490'];   Incidents, Audit Log, Response Threads Oracle B2C Service, All versions  Issue   From the Audit Log of our example incident, there is a Response Sent transaction, but not a corresponding Response thread entry at that same time.Ã‚Â ;  Because it is not possible to delete a thread entry once it is committed to the discussion thread, it is likely what you are seeing is that the agent opened the incident for edit, checked the Send on Save check box (or it was checked by default), and then saved the incident. Selecting the Send option from the ribbon can also have the same result. If they entered any text, they may have inadvertently erased that entry before saving the incident. In this case, although an agent may receive a prompt asking if they wish to proceed without entering a response, it is still possible to click Yes past that prompt. This action will send the incident response message (creating the Response Sent transaction in the Audit Log) with all existing thread entries. As one example for the use of this functionality, this allows agents to 're-send' the last response message without having to re-type a new (or duplicate) thread entry. Another possibility is that it may have been an inadvertent click for the agent to enable the Send on Save check box with their last update to the incident (i.e. changing assigned and status).

Renaming an interface or site name;Answer ID 4547;Is it possible to change theÃ‚Â name ofÃ‚Â an interface or site once it is created?;['Answer ID 10745', 'Answer ID 9700'];   Oracle B2C Service Interface, All versions;"  It is possible to change the site name, interface name, and interface vhostname after a site has been created. Â  Interface Rename: All agents will need to be logged out of the interface when the rename is performed. Renaming an interface will cause Â downtime while DNS Â finishes propagating, this typically takes an hour up to several hours. Please note that we have no insight or control over the DNS propagation. However, you can check Â https://dnschecker.org. This will help know when the name change has been propagated via DNS. For more information on how this process works, refer to Â DNS Propagation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Explained. The interface name and interface vhostname (end-user page url) affect the launch url. Therefore, interface renames will require all agents to log out and re-install the product from the new launch url. Â  In some cases, it may be necessary to test the interface rename on the test site first. However, be aware that the interface vhostname (end-user page url) should include ""tst"" (example: newname-tst1.custhelp.com) because if/when you implement the changes on the production site (newname.custhelp.com), the url will already be used if the ""tst"" is not included. It is not possible to use the same url on both the test and production site. Â  Â  Once interface renames are completed on the production site, best practices suggest to refresh/re-create the test site(s) to have the changes implemented on the test sites. Â  Interface names only allow lowercase letters, numbers and the underscore character Â (_). Typical meta characters are not permitted in site names. (!@#$%^&amp;*()) Site Rename: Renaming a site does not cause any downtime. Â  This action does not take DNS propagation. There is no impact to the administration console, Â the customer portal, or the customer portal end user pages.  Â Typically the process can require up to 30 minutes to complete. Â You can request this change to be made outside of business hours. Â  Once site rename Â is Â completed on the production site, best practices suggest to refresh/re-create the test site(s) to have the changes implemented on the test sites. Best practices also suggest to always keep the production site and corresponding test sites named the same. (example: newsitename, newsitename__tst1, newsitename__tst2) Site names only allow lowercase letters, numbers and underscore character Â (_). Typical meta characters are not permitted in site names. (!@#$%^&amp;*()) Additional Information: Please note, when there are post-update(upgrade) transactions still in process on the production site, we are unable to rename interfaces or Â site names Â until these have been completed. Â These processes can take up to 10 Â days to complete. We also offer the option to first rename Â the interface on an existing test site, so that you can proactively evaluate the process to confirm there will be no impact. To only change the interface vhostname (end-user page url), this task can be completed in the Configuration Assistant self-service tool. To change the interface name and interface vhostname (end-user page url), submit a service request to Ask Technical Support.  Please Note: Oracle B2C Service Technical Support is not equipped to evaluate your site configuration and business practices and predict the impact of how renaming your site and/or interface name and interface vhostname Â may or may not impact your particular site. They are also not able to provide a dedicated agent(s) to join bridge calls or Â monitor processes while a change is taking place. Should this level of support be needed, please engage Oracle Consulting and/or consider Oracle Cloud Priority Support."

Using a question more than once in survey;Answer ID 4549;I have added a question to a survey on several different pages.Ã‚Â  Why do I only see one answer for each person in my reports?;['Answer ID 10745', 'Answer ID 9700'];   Surveys, All versions;  Â  Â  Create a separate question in the Â Oracle B2C Service console for each page in your survey. Â  Â The questions can have the same text but reporting will show each individual answer and the question ID can be used to determine which page the answer is associated to. Cause: Oracle B2C Service Â tracks a question response and associates it to the survey but there is no association to the page of the survey. Â  Â When the customer fills out a question, the product will see if the customer already answered the question. Â  Â If they did, the new answer will replace the old. Â  Â The product acts as if the customer filled out the question and used the back button to go back and change their answer.

Â  Â  Â  Â 1. Â  Â Login into the Oracle B2C Service site (https://cx.rightnow.com).  Â  Â  Â  Â 2. Â  Â In the upper right area Â locate the link ""My Site Tools"" and click. Â   Â  Â  Â  Â 3. Â  Â You will need to Login again as this is a different area of the product.  Â  Â  Â  Â 4. Â  Â Under Hosting Services, select Utility Stats.  Â  Â  Â  Â 5. Â  Â Under the site-name -&gt; interface name, select the utility you wish to check. Under 'Message' it should indicate ""No problems encountered"" or ""OK: no error"" indicating the utility is enabled and running without error. Â  Â If the Message indicates ""Interface is in no-utils"", the utility is disabled. Â  Â If there is an Exit Code other than 0 and no Message, then there is an issue and the utility may auto-disable according to server rules set into place by the Â Oracle B2C Service Â - Cloud Opertions Â team. This information can be especially useful when troubleshooting email issues, as the techmail last run can show error messages related to mailbox connections, for example; NO PASS which means that the password configuration for the mailbox is incorrect. For more information on various utility messages, refer to Answer ID 1067: Techmail messages in the Utility Stats page."

Custom field menu item limit;Answer ID 4560;Is there a limit of how many menu itemsÃ‚Â you can add for a singleÃ‚Â custom field?;['Answer ID 155', 'Answer ID 5626'];   Custom Fields Oracle B2C Service;  There is Â a Â limit on how many items can be added Â for menu item Â custom fields. Â  Â There is a strict limit in total Â but that value can be dependent on many factors. For example, one factor is Â how many languages you have configured Â on your site. The strict limit is Â 8800 total Â menu items. This Â total is Â divided by how many languages the site has configured. Â  This will cause customer sites to have different limits depending on their configuration. One Â site that has a single language Â can add up to Â 8800 items where Â another Â site with 21 languages will have a limit of 419.

Incident incorrectly assigned from round robin (logged in) queue;Answer ID 4561;Why are new incidents, routed to a round robin (logged in) queue, assigned to an account not currently logged in?;['Answer ID 155', 'Answer ID 5626']; Ã‚Â   Incident Queues, Analytics Oracle B2C Service;"  This behavior can occur where there is invalid login data in the user transactions table. To resolve this, you can use a standard report called Logged in Staff Accounts located in Analytics\Public Reports\Common\Site Administration\Staff Management. You can also create a basic custom report to monitor logged in values. If you believe incidents are being assigned to agents not logged in, check this report to confirm what is in the user transactions table. A basic outline of such a report would be as follows: Filter 1: user_trans.type = Login This pulls only 'login' type transactions. Filter 2: user_trans.acct_id is not null This system only looks for transactions associated to specific account ID values. Filter 3: user_trans.end_dttm is null This pulls only login transactions where there is no end time (or logged out time). NOTE: For filter 2 and 3, you may need to disable ""Make this filter selectable at run time"" to have the specific operators mentioned above become available. Include output columns such as account, start date and end date to view the logged in date/time stamps for each agent. Where you find one that is invalid (i.e. logged in for more than 12 hours or a disabled account), you can reset that user's login information. Login into the application under that account and then back out. This will update the user transactions table with an end time. The account will then be logged out of the application and no longer eligible for auto-assignments. Cause: The user transactions table (user_trans) tracks when agents login/log out of the application, as well as other details. This is one of the tables the round robin feature looks at to determine if an agent is logged into the system and available for assignment. Where there are login times with no end times, the system believes these accounts are logged in. If those logged in accounts are also associated to the round robin queue in question, incidents will then be assigned to them. Where an error occurred and an account was not able to log out of the application successfully, this can prevent the system from writing an end time for the logged in transaction. In this case, an invalid login record can be left in the user transactions table."

Name displays differently in chat than expected;Answer ID 4562;WhyÃ‚Â is myÃ‚Â Agent's name showing up differently in the Chat window?;['Answer ID 2785'];   Staff account name displayed in Chat Oracle B2C Service;"  This is due to the information contained in the ""Display Name"" portion of the Agent's account within Oracle B2C Service. Please note this is in reference to the Agent's name, eg: ""Sammy Smith: Hi, how may I help you today?"" and is not in reference to when a standard text being used as a greeting. (eg: ""Sammy Smith: Hi, my name is Sammy Smith, please allow me a moment to review your question."") To change the Display Name: 1) Login to your Oracle B2C Service Â console with an account that has sufficient privileges to edit a Staff Account. 2) Select Configuration -&gt; Staff Management -&gt; Staff Accounts by Group (or Profile, etc). 3) Open the Staff Account you wish to edit. 4) Select the ""Display Name"" field and adjust the name as necessary. 5) Save &amp; Close. If you adjust the display name in the middle of an agent's shift, you may need them to clear the Oracle B2C Service Cache (see answer below) and have them log off and back in to ensure that their console will load the new display name.

Prod/cat visibility changes removing all answers from end-user pages;Answer ID 4565;Why did all of my answers disappear from my end-user pages whenÃ‚Â I just enabled visibility on one of my products or categories?;['Answer ID 1179', 'Answer ID 645'];   Oracle B2C Service, Customer Portal, Enduser Pages;  In order to fix this problem when it occurs, you have to locate the sole product or category that was enabled for end-user visibility and then disable its end-user visibility. Â  You can Â locate the product or category Â by creating a custom report that incorporates the following fields and filters.  Fields:   products.id.id  products.prod_hierarchy   Filters:   interface.name equals {your_interface_name}  prod_vis.end_user equals Yes    For categories, just Â switch the above from products to categories and prod_* to cat_* of course. It is also possible to use the Product Visibility (ID 13040) and Category Visibility (ID 13045) reports.  Â These can be copied and modified as needed to meet your specific business needs. Cause: If end-user visibility is not enabled for all products or categories on a given interface, the default answers list report assumes that product/category end-user visibility should not be taken into account by the report filters. This seems pretty intuitive by itself, but the problem with it is that if a site administrator enables end-user visibility for just one product or category and none of their answers are linked to that product/category, then all the answers will suddenly disappear from the end-user pages.  For more information on the impact of product and category edits, refer to the following: Answer ID 1179: Effect on incidents and answers when moving or deleting products or categories.

Custom field names display differently in the workspace than from their column names;Answer ID 4567;"Why do custom fields in a workspace strip the ""_"" if they exist andÃ‚Â capitalize the two words?";['Answer ID 1179', 'Answer ID 645'];   Custom Fields, Workspace Designer;"  This is done by design in Â the workspace designer. Â  Cause: The workspace designer Â strips the ""_"" from custom fields if they exist in the column name Â and Â capitalizes the two words. Column Name = cf_test converts to this in a workspace xml FieldId=""C$CfTest"". Â  This also gets displayed in the workspace designer when you view the details of the workspace object as (Incident.C$CfTest). Â  The ""C$"" is the way the application identifies the custom field."

To do this: 1. Edit the report 2. Add a column for Answer ID 3. Right-click the Answer ID column and select Edit Format 3. Click on the URL tab 4. Check the option ""Display cell value as a link"" 5. Check the option ""Use custom URL"" 6. Click ""Advanced URL definition"" link 7. Add Â  Â ""a_id/"" to the text area 8. In the drop down ""[Choose Report Column Value]"", select Answer ID 9. From the 'Begin with' drop down, select ""Answer Detail URL""  NOTE: Using the 'Begin with' option Â ensures that cloned site Â  URLs Â (i.e. upgrade or Â test site), Â point to cloned site answers.  When the report is run, the report will grab the a_id value and append it to the URL set in Advanced URL definition. The outcome will be the value of the column displayed as a hyperlink. When you click a URL link in a report, your web browser launches and the website the URL points to opens. You can customize the URL and add variables to the link, using the values in any of the reportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s columns.

"Audit log of incident shows a description of ""From Explorer""";Answer ID 4572;"In the audit log of an incident, what does a description of ""From Explorer"" mean?";['Answer ID 538'];   Incidents, Audit log;  When the Description in the incident audit log says 'From Explorer' it means that a change was made to some data associated to the incident.  Â When this happens the incident must to be updated to reflect that change.  Â For instance, if a product, category or disposition is deleted an update will be made to every incident that is associated to the deleted record.  Â That edit will have a source of 'From Explorer.'  Â Another example of this behavior would be if an Account is moved to a different group.  Â The incident record does hold values for the assigned account and group IDs.  Â When an Account is moved to a new group an update will be made to every incident assigned to that account in order to reflect the new group ID.  Â The source of that edit will also be 'From Explorer' in this case.

Google indexed our site and we want it removed;Answer ID 4575;How do I remove our site's search results from Google?;['Answer ID 4577', 'Answer ID 4411'];   End user pages on all versions.;"  When pages are inadvertently indexed by a search engine there are multiple steps that must be followed.  Fix the issue that allowed the pages to be indexed. For information on removing your answers or pages from visibility on the Internet, refer to Answer ID 4577: Answers are visible on the end user pages and should not be.  Occasionally the issue that allowed answer visibility Â may be Â resolved before the data is discovered in a search engine. Â  Â In these cases it Â may be difficult if not impossible to discover the reason that the search engine discovered the data.  Submit request to Google, or other search engine, to have the site or pages removed from their index.  After you have fixed this issue that made your pages visible, the pages are still held in Google's index and cache. Â  Â The pages will eventually be removed when Google reindexes the site. Â  Â If you need to remove them quicker you need to make a request directly to Google. Â  To remove pages manually you should use Google's removal tool to expedite the process. For an explanation of this process, refer to http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=164734 To verify ownership of a site, you should add the site in your Â Google Webmaster Tools, http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools. There are 2 options to verifying ownership of a site with Google. Â  Â Information on this process can be found in Google's Webmaster Tools under Add a Site -&gt; Verify ownership. Option 1 - Upload a Verification File  You can prove ownership of a site by uploading a verification file to the web root directory. Â  Â Create an incident with Â Oracle Â Service Cloud Technical Support requesting that the file be uploaded to the web root directory. Download the verification Â file from Google Webmaster Tools and attach it to an incident. Â  After the file has been uploaded you will need to verify your site with Google.   Option 2 - Insert a Meta Tag Â  in the page's HEAD section.  You can also add a Meta Tag to your template which is usually standard.php. Â  Â Note that this method will not work if you are using logins or a configuration such as SEC_VALID_ENDUSER_HOSTS to restrict access to your site. Â  Only pages visible to everyone can be viewed by a search engine. Â  For information on site verification with Â Meta Â Tags, refer to Â Answer ID 4411: Registering your site with a Search Engine.  Cause: Any pages or documents with public visibility on the end user pages can be indexed by search engines. Â  Â  There are several reasons that pages may be visible:  Security configuration Â may have Â been configured incorrectly, Â  Answers may have been inadvertently set to public or product and category visibility may be inadvertently changed, Â  The Sitemap feature may be enabled for your site, or Files may be uploaded to the assets directory which does not have visibility controls."

Restrict access to the end user pages with configuration settings.  If your site is internal to your organization you can either require login to your end-user pages or restrict access to your end-user pages by IP address. For information on requiring login, refer to Answer ID 881: Requiring customers to log in to end-user pages. To restrict access to your site by IP address, refer to Answer ID 245: Restricting computers or hosts that can access the Oracle B2C Service pages. To temporarily disable Â the end-user pages on your site, refer to Answer ID 2653: Temporarily disable end-user pages.  2. Change visibility settings for affected answers.  Answers that are not restricted by access level or status are visible on the end user pages. Â  Â Answers restricted by product, category or language will not be available in searches or reports but will be visible on all interfaces by the answer detail URL (&lt;sitename&gt;/app/answers/detail/a_id/####). For information on answer access levels, refer to Answer ID 208: Specifying answer access levels to display on the end-user pages. For information on how product and category visibility affects answers, refer to Answer ID 1112: Publishing an answer to the end-user pages.  3. Request changes to the robots.txt file or turn off Sitemap.  The Sitemap feature in RightNow is a useful tool that allows search engines to find content on your site. This feature is enabled by default. If you wish to disable Sitemap create a incident with Technical Support and request that Sitemap be disabled. Â  This will change the robots.txt file to disallow all search engines and will remove the sitemap.xml file. For more information on Sitemap, refer to Answer ID 2553: Using a sitemap with our RightNow application. If you wish to make specific changes to your robots.txt file, please submit a service request to Ask Technical Support with the request. Please include the specific text that you wish to add to the file. Â  For more information on the format of the robots.txt file, refer to http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html.  4.

Chats are waiting in queue longer than time set in USER_WAIT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT;Answer ID 4582;Why are some chats waiting in queue longer than the time configured in the USER_WAIT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT setting?;['Answer ID 1960'];Chat - Analytics Oracle B2C Service;" The functionality of canceling requests based on the USER_WAIT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT setting is based on a timed event.  Â This timed event happens every 30 seconds. Â  This is why some extra time, up to 30 seconds beyond the setting's value is sometimes seen. Â  The chat server has timed processes for some functionality making some related configuration settings not exact.  Â This setting only works while the chat is not assigned to an agent. Â  At the point an agent receives a toast notification, the chat is assigned to that agent. Â  If they deny the chat, it goes back into the queue."" For sessions ending just over the time configured Due to the timed processes, when the USER_WAIT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT setting is set at 120 seconds, a chat session Â could end at exactly 2 minutes or it may take up to 2 minutes 30 seconds for it to end. For sessions with longer wait times: Another case to note is when chats are assigned to an agent but they do not accept the chat. When an agent is set to available and a chat is launched, the chat will be taken out of the queue and an invitation will be presented to the available agent. In some cases the agent has the ability to ignore the invitation. If they do this, the chat will be put back in queue at that time. Note that since the chat was taken out of the queue and put back in the queue, the wait time will start over. In cases that you see a very long wait time, check the chat transcript or chat session data to see if the chat had been assigned to an agent and the agent declined the invitation. Typically, for very long wait periods, it is likely that only one agent was available so the chat kept assigning to that one agent. The agent continued to decline the chat over and over so the wait time could never actually reach the configured threshold. To help administrators monitor and/or verify wait times: It is possible to create a custom report. A basic outline of such a report is as follows: Filter 1: chats.termination_event = End-user was Queued Too Long This is the specific chat event type that is based on the configuration setting. Filter 2: chats.requested (select any date range needed) It's important to include a date range to limit results to only relevant records. Include output columns such as Chat ID, Account ID, Requested, Completed and a column to calculate Queue Wait Time. You can also include contact details such as email and name if you wish. To calculate the Queue Wait Time, add a column and edit the definition. Under Functions &gt; Date Functions, select the date_diff() function. Include chats.completed and chats.requested in the expression. The expression will look as follows: date_diff(chats.completed,chats.requested). You may also want to edit the format of this column to ensure seconds are included in the output calculations. This will allow you to view, down to the second, how long an end-user was waiting in queue. NOTE: When you generate the report, where the account ID field is blank, these wait times should be within the 30 second range of the USER_WAIT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT setting due to the timed process. NOTE: Where the Account ID field is not blank, these wait times can be longer for the reason stated above.

Profile precedence permissions;Answer ID 4588;How do I determine what profile permissions take precedence?;['Answer ID 768']; Ã‚Â   Profiles/Staff Accounts Oracle B2C Service;"  If a user profile has the ""Profiles"" checkbox checked (under the ""Administration"" tab) then all profiles will be available for selection from the profile drop-down menu. Â  However, if the ""Profile"" option is not checked the product makes the following checks in the following order when calculating which profiles will be visible for selection:   1. Â  Does the user's profile have (at least) every global permission that the target profile has? 2. Â  Does the user's profile have (at least) every CSS permission that the target profile has? (except ""Assignment - Appears in menus"") 3. Â  Does the user's profile have (at least) every MA permission that the target profile has? (except ""Assignment - Appears in menus"") 4. Â  Does the user's profile have (at least) every SA permission that the target profile has? (except ""Assignment - Appears in menus"")   where: Global Permissions = the following permissions granted to this profile a. Â  On the Administration tab: Â  CP Promote, CP Stage, CP Edit, Broadcast, Notification, and Scripting  b. Â  On the Task tab: Â  Read, Add, Edit, Delete, and BOTH Thread options   CSS Permissions = the permissions granted to this profile on the Service tab of the profile MA Permissions = the permissions granted to this profile on the Outreach tab of the profile SA Permissions = the permissions granted to this profile on the Feedback Â tab of the profile  IMPORTANT: Â  If the answer to ANY of these is no, then the target profile is left off of the available profiles list. As an example, if a managers profile (i.e. called ""Manager"") does not have chat configured then a manager using that profile will not be able to assign a staff account to a profile that has chat configured (i.e. called ""Agent - Chat"") because the Â CSS Â Permissions Â for the ""Agent - Chat"" profile will be greater than the Â CSS Permissions Â of the ""Manager"" profile. Â   More information on profile permissions is available in Â Answer 768: Profile Permissions."

Add-In not showing inside Oracle B2C Service (Agent) console;Answer ID 4602;I have an add-in that usually shows when I'm in the AdminÃ‚Â console.Ã‚Â  But I don't currently see it.;['Answer ID 2543']; Ã‚Â  Admin Console / Add-In;"  Â  There are a few possible solutions to this issue: A) If the profile your staff account is associated to does not have the add-in selected, the add-in will not show. Â  It is possible that an administrator removed that permission from your profile. Â  Have an administrator edit your profile and view the Add-In's section to ensure your particular add-in is still enabled. Â  B) If your previous instance of Oracle B2C Service Â had died because of a network issue or other issue, you may have been prompted with this upon your next login: Â  ""The application did not exit properly the last time it was started. Would you like to temporarily disable extensions that may have caused the application to behave improperly?"" If you clicked Yes in this prompt, your site would have loaded without any add-in's enabled. Â  Simply logging out and back in should resolve it. Â  But just make sure to click 'No' in that prompt if it comes up again if you have add-in's you need to access. C) Although uncommon, the Add-Ins folder for your site may have been corrupted or Â did not Â download correctly. Â  You may need to delete the add-ins from that folder and re-launch Oracle B2C Service Â to reload it. Â  Location of AddIns folder: Windows 7 and above: Â  Â C:\Users\&lt;your windows login&gt;\AppData\Roaming\RightNow_Technologies\&lt;your site&gt;\&lt;version number&gt;\Users\&lt;user number&gt;\AddIns version number Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Version of Oracle B2C Service, use the highest number. user number Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Account ID of user(s) have logged in to the console. Usually there will only be one. If in doubt, delete the Addins folder for each one.  "

Does the Oracle B2C Service application work with roaming profiles or nonpersistent VDIs;Answer ID 4605;Why do we receive an error in our roaming profile or nonpersistent VDI environment when a user logs in after Oracle B2C Service is deployed?;['Answer ID 2543'];  Supported versions Issue  We receive an error in our roaming profile or nonpersistent VDI environment when a user logs in after Oracle B2C Service application is deployed. Are roaming profiles or nonpersistent VDIs supported?; Avoid deploying the application in a roaming profile or nonpersistent VDI Â environments Cause: The Â Oracle B2C Service application is deployed using the Microsoft ClickOnce technology. This technology is not supported by Microsoft with roaming profiles or nonpersistent VDI Â environments. For details see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2571899 Deployment issues related to the deployment of Oracle B2C Service in a roaming profile environment Â or nonpersistent VDI Â environments are not supported by Oracle B2C Service. The Oracle B2C Service application will run Â in a roaming profile or a nonpersistent VDI Â environment and is Â supported Â except for the deployment issue as noted above. Deploying the Oracle B2C Service application in a roaming profile environment or a nonpersistent VDI Â environment, will necessitate redeploying the local, user specific, application files each time the user logs on. This is best accomplished by always starting the application from the launch page.

What type of desktops are supported for VMware and Citrix?;Answer ID 4607;Are VM stateless and stateful desktops supported?;['Answer ID 1818'];   November 2011 and newer releases;  The CX application is supported with stateful or persistent VM desktop images. Cause: When deployed in a stateless or non-persistent VM image environment, the application will need to be redeployed each time a user logs in. This is due to the user profile folder structure. The %username%\AppData\local folder must match the %username%\Local Settings folder. Since the %username%\Local Setting folder does not contain user data in a stateless environment, the application launch files need to be redeployed. This is best accomplished by starting the application from the launch URL.

Will redirecting Appdata work if roaming profiles does not?;Answer ID 4610;Can we redirect the AppData folder in our roaming environment?;['Answer ID 1818'];   Oracle B2C Service, Deployment All supported versions;  You cannot overcome the deployment issue of running a ClickOnce application in a Windows Â Roaming profile environment by redirecting the AppData folder. Cause: Redirecting the AppData folder does not copy all ClickOnce deployment files. When deploying a ClickOnce application, Windows Â will duplicate the %userprofile%\ AppData\Local Â  folder to %userprofile\Local Settings. For the Oracle B2C Service application to launch, the RightNow-specific files must reside in both the the %userprofile%\ AppData\Local and the %userprofile\Local Settings folders.

Custom Deployment Location (CDL);Answer ID 4611;What is the CustomÃ‚Â Deployment Location option used for?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle B2C ServiceÃ‚Â versions November 2010 to current;"  The Custom Deployment Location (CDL) Â is a directory or location where the Â deployment files are stored in your local network. This location will be either on individual workstations or a shared network location. This location will be used to store and deploy client files and libraries (the files that are usually downloaded from the Oracle Â server to the workstation by each staff member upon initial log in). When this option is enabled, these files are downloaded once from the Oracle servers and stored at the location you define, conserving bandwidth. In addition, because they are stored outside the staff memberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s profile, the files can be accessed by multiple users, reducing the amount of disk space required for deploying the Service Cloud application. For more information on this, refer to your version's Support Documentation. Within the specific version support documentation, access the ""Client Deployment Guide"" and search for Â 'Define a Custom Deployment Location"" "

Windows 7:  Screen flicker;Answer ID 4612;We just upgraded from XP to Windows 7. Why does the CX application flicker?;['Answer ID 5168'];  All supported versions;" The screen flickering with Windows 7 and the CX application is a Windows 7 design limitation based on the kernel stack size. Once the hierarchy of windows exceeds a certain size, screen flickering and flickering of the CX application can be seen. This screen flicker is more prevalent in the 64-bit version of Windows 7. Some things you can do to reduce this flickering are: Ensure that your video card is compatible with Windows 7 and that the newest drivers for the video card are installed. To check your video card, follow this link:  Â  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Browse.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;category=Graphics%20Cards%20%26%20Components&amp;subcategory=Graphics%20Cards  Â  Also, ensure that your BIOS, Chipset, and NIC drivers are up to date.  Â  Consider redesigning your workspace and or reducing the number of nested tabs within the application.

Data displayed in Cross Tab Report Columns;Answer ID 4621;Can columns within a Cross Tab report displayÃ‚Â when there isÃ‚Â noÃ‚Â data?;['Answer ID 485', 'Answer ID 2245'];  Analytics, Cross-Tabs; This answer is specifically for survey data Â in Â a cross-tab report. Only columns for Â the Â questions answered Â will display in the cross-tab report. For example, if a survey recipient answered 3 out of 8 questions, then only the three columns associated to the answered questions would display. The reason for this is that the cross tab feature is unable to provide any content that does not exist in the report. So if the report does not return data for a particular survey within the specified time, the cross-tab feature will not know about that survey.

SLA expiration time;Answer ID 4623;When does a Service Level Agreement (SLA) start and stop?;['Answer ID 605'];  SLAs, All Supported Versions; SLAs end at 12:00 am PST on the day of the expiration. For example, if your interface has configuration setting TZ_INTERFACE set to EST then your SLAs will expire at 3:00 am on the day of the expiration. Nonte If you have a contact with an SLA that expires on December 31 and the SLA does not start until January 1, then there would be 24 hours where that contact would not be associated to the SLA because the SLA expires on December 31 at 12:00 am and the new SLA does not start until January 1 at 12:00 am. Some potential issues during the time between December 31 and January 1 might be that the contact would not be able to perform any actions required by an SLA, such as viewing privileged answers or creating incidents.

Duplicate data in reports;Answer ID 4631;How canÃ‚Â I get my report to display only unique values instead of having multiple rows with the same value?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Group Results;  Grouping data in an output level allows you to combine records with similar data into one row. Output levels with grouped data often have additional output levels added to them, so you can drill down into another output level to view details about the grouped records. When you group data, you can order the grouped columns to best suit your needs when you create drill-down output levels. To enable grouping:  Open the report in edit mode Select the output level you want to edit from the Level drop-down menu at the top of the design surface Click the Level tab on the ribbon Click on the 'Group Results' checkbox located in the Grouping Section Save the report  For additional information, refer to the 'Enable grouping in an output level' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Search for dashed Social Security Numbers is returning unrelated incidents;Answer ID 4633;Is there a standard report thatÃ‚Â I can use to search for incidents containing Social Security Numbers that use dashes?;['Answer ID 2252', 'Answer ID 1974', 'Answer ID 1350', 'Answer ID 1731'];Analytics; By design, the standard 'Incidents' report (ID 120) incident search does not Â narrow search results to only incidents containing Â Social Security Numbers (SSN's) with dashes. Â  Â As designed, this report Â uses stemming and will break apart your alphanumeric Serial Number into pieces. Â  Because standard reports employ stemming, no standard report will deliver Â a list of exact matches of dashed Social Security Numbers Â search results. Â  Many of the incidents that return as results in this report do not contain the submitted string, and only include similar (stemmed search) strings. In order to create a custom report that will isolate only the results that exactly match Â the entire SSN search string including the two dashes, Â you will need to   Make a copy of Incidents report 120 Add a new runtime filter such as:  Incidents.search_and_or IN LIST Select AND (match ALL terms)  Please see the attached screen capture document for an illustration. Â  Â The Incidents.search_and_or Â filter will require that all of the pieces are exact matches, and should reduce your search results to only the exact SSN match in most cases. The following answers describe the stemming factor in Â greater detail: Answer ID 2252: Using the incidents.search_thread column in reports Answer ID 1974: Difference between searching on Subject or SummaryThread Notes The Oracle Cloud Customer Connect is a great resource for finding the answers to your custom reporting questions.

Error when we send a response with a channel type different to e-mail;Answer ID 4634;Why do we get an error when we try to send a response via a channel other than e-mail?;['Answer ID 2252', 'Answer ID 1974', 'Answer ID 1350', 'Answer ID 1731']; Ã‚Â   Incidents, Channel,Ã‚Â Administration Console;"  The product is functioning as designed. All default Channels are pre-populated in the incident workspace and cannot be removed. The standard Channels are hard coded into the console and available in case an integration is made with other technology (a fax machine or phone system, for example). To find out what integrations are possible and who can provide them for you please contact your Sales Manager. Agents should be trained to only select Email if Email is the channel that the response is being sent through (and no integrations apply).  For example, a customer submits an Â incident Â via email. The agent changes the Channel to Fax when responding to the customer via the incident.  When the agent saves the response the following error message appears: Send Response Response thread with this channel type cannot be sent on save. Save aborted.   Cause: If you do not use the default response Channel for an incident response (Email is default) you may get the following error: ""Response thread with this channel type cannot be sent on save. Save aborted."" Logically, Email is the only Channel that an email response can be sent through. The Channel names can be customized but the default Channels cannot be removed from the Channel list in the incident workspace.

The text length defines the limit to the length of text strings appearing in the column. Text strings that exceed the limit will be truncated. You can edit the text length for a text column on a report by: 1. Open the report in edit mode 2. Right click on the column you wish to extend the text limit for. 3. Â Select Â ""Edit Format"" 4. Click the Text Tab 5. Â Edit the ""Limit text to"" field located under the ""Text length"" section 6. Click OK Note: If you do not want to limit text length then select the radio button ""Do not limit text length"". The column is automatically resized to fit the length of the output text. This option is available only for VARCHAR columns. It is not available for memo(blob) and menu type columns.Please note however, that this should be used with some discretion and best practice is to limit your data sets to only what is necessary. Large data sets that are unlimited (or even set to very high values) could encounter memory problems due to Windows constraints and will Â not be exported. To display the entire contents of the text field when running a report you will need to make sure the Wrap Text option is selected. Selecting the wrap text column will allow data to wrap to a new line if it exceeds the width of the column. You can select wrap text by: 1. Open the report in edit mode 2. Right click on the column you wish to wrap text for. 3. Â Select Â ""Edit Format"" 4. Click the Â Alignment Tab 5. Â Select Â ""Wrap Text"" field and set ""Limit Wrapped Text to x Rows"" located under the ""Data"" section 6. Click OK  For additional information, refer to the 'Editing column format options' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Why is my ROQL customization affected by replication being behind?;Answer ID 4675;Why does replication beingÃ‚Â behind, affectÃ‚Â the performance of our customization that uses ROQL?;['Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   Customization, ROQL  Issue   I have a customization in place that is utilizing ROQL and when replication is behind, it affects the performance of this customization.Ã‚Â  Why is this?Ã‚Â ;  Â  ROQL queries always run off of the Production database unless a query has been blacklisted. Â  If a query is blacklisted, it will either be blocked or it will be redirected to run off of the Replication database. Â  There may be times when the Replication server falls behind which may affect your ROQL customization if the query is redirected to run off of this particular server. Â  Most blacklisted queries can be redesigned to be compliant. Â  ROQL queries are also run by product functionality behind the scenes, and those queries can be blacklisted as well.  Â If Â blacklisted queries are suspected, please submit an Â SR to Â Technical Support Â for further investigation. Â

"An ""Unknown Error has Occurred"" when trying to deploy the Oracle B2C Service application";Answer ID 4677;"Why are we getting the error ""Unknown Error has Occurred"" after logging into our site?";['Answer ID 5168'];   Updates, Maintenance Packs Oracle B2C Service, all versions;"  One reason that this error can occur is when one of the downloaded .zip assemblies is unable to be extracted during the installation process. This is caused by the file not downloading completely before extraction, or becoming corrupt after downloading. If this is the case, then you will see an ""Updates"" folder in your site files directory. For example:  Windows Vista/7: C:\Users\%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\RightNow_Technologies\MySite\Updates Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\%UserProfile%\Application Data\RightNow_Technologies\MySite\Updates  Once these files are extracted this directory will be automatically deleted, so the existence of this folder is a good indication that one or more .zip files have become corrupt. Viewing the timestamps of these files should tell you which file is bad, as it will normally have an older date/time. To fix this problem, either delete the specific .zip file that is throwing the error, or delete the Updates folder completely and attempt to log in again. The application will initiate re-downloading these files and they should extract properly."

Read-only access to answers;Answer ID 4678;I would like to give my agents access to open answers but how do I prevent them from editing them?;['Answer ID 2559']; Ã‚Â   Answers, Workspaces;"  You can give your agents access to open and read answers and prevent them from editing the answer by making a change to the profile associated to the agent as well as the answer workspace they are utilizing. Â  To accomplish this, you will need to edit the Answer Workspace and edit the agent Profile. First, modify the Answer workspace that the agents are utilizing. Â  You will need to Â remove any references to 'Save', 'Delete' and 'Save Â &amp; Close' on the workspace by taking the following steps; 1. Navigate to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces 2. Open the appropriate answer workspace or make a copy of the standard workspace to make changes to 3. Click the 'Ribbon' button on the 'Home' tab in the ribbon 4. Double click on the Ã¢â‚¬ËœHomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ line in the Ã¢â‚¬ËœEditing RibbonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ area in the Ã¢â‚¬ËœRibbon DesignerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pop up window and then double click on the 'ActionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Â  This will bring up the buttons that are currently in the ribbon on the workspace 5. Highlight the appropriate buttons you would like to delete and click the Ã¢â‚¬ËœDelete ButtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ button 6. Next, you must remove the Ã¢â‚¬ËœSaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ buttons from the Ã¢â‚¬ËœConfigure Quick Access ButtonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ area 7. Click on this area in the Ã¢â‚¬ËœRibbon PreviewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and remove the appropriate buttons by de-selecting them in the 'Configure Quick Access buttons' pop up window 8. Once you have removed all buttons as necessary from the Quick Access pop up window, click Ã¢â‚¬ËœOKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and 'OK' again and save the workspace Please note, it is very important that the 'Save' buttons are removed from both the Ribbon and the Quick Access Buttons area. Â  If you remove the 'Save' buttons from the Ribbon but leave a 'Save' button in the Quick Access Buttons area, the agent will be able to make changes to an answer and save these changes Next, edit the profile associated to the agent by taking the following steps; 1. Navigate to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles and open the appropriate profile 2. Ensure that the Answer workspace you just modified is selected in the Workspaces/Workflows 3. Click Permissions in the Ribbon 4. Click on the Service tab 5. Select 'Add/Edit' under Answers 6. Save the profile In order for an agent to open an answer, they must have the 'Add/Edit' permissions under Answers selected on their Profile. Once you have made all changes above, an agent will be able to open and read answers. Â  The agent will be Â able Â to make changes to the answer however they will not be able to save any changes to an answer with the modified workspace that does not include any Save or Delete buttons. Â  Rather, when they close the answer they will receive a pop-up message that indicates 'Data cannot be saved at this time. Â  If you continue, your changes will be lost'. Â  Once they click ok on this, any modifications they made to the answer will not be saved. Â   For more information on setting read only access, Â refer to Â Read-only access to records."

Enabling some agents to handle more chats than others within the same profile;Answer ID 4685;How do I enable some agents to handle more chats than others within the same profile?;['Answer ID 2559'];Chat-enabled Profiles Account Options - Incoming Chat Assignment Control; Since profiles are designed to group accounts according to functionality, it is generally not advisable to have different accounts in the same profile using a different maximum chat session Â value. Â  Â However, there is a way to accomplish this functionality using the same profile  Open the profile configuration Go to the service tab Scroll down to Â  checkbox Select the Â Set Max Sessions checkbox Save the profile The accounts on that profile Â now have the option to set their own Max Sessions value Â when navigating to the Â following location: A. Application button (upper left corner, round button) B. RightNow CX Options C. Communication Center D. Incoming Chat Assignment Control E. Modify the number of Maximum Chat Sessions F. Click OK Notes Many of our customers do not wish to give this control over to agents. Â  Â It is possible that these option changes could be made by an administrator logging in with their accounts, however the possibility exists for agents to locate this Â configuration on their own Â and adjust it in a way that is not Â in alignment with Â your best Â business process. Â  Â A better solution is to copy the profile, then split the accounts on each of the two profiles according to the number of maximum chats you want those agents to handle at a given time.

Keyword Search report results do not match on the drilldown for the phrase stem;Answer ID 4688;Why is there a discrepancy between the number of answers for phrase stem and answers displayed when clicking on the number in the Keyword Search report?;['Answer ID 2559'];   Answers, Analytics Oracle B2C Service;  The Keyword Search standard report has a drilldown on the number of answers that match the search criteria. Â  If you drilldown on the number of answers that match the search criteria to the search words themselves and drilldown one more time to see the answers, you may see a difference in the number of answers. Â  The reason for the differences in the numbers is the second drilldown level is utilizing a linked report, the Search Knowledgebase standard report. The Keyword Search report is utilizing the keyword_searches table and is returning results based on what was whereas the Search Knowledgebase report is returning results based on what is. Â  Answers can be created, updated, and deleted and any change you make to an answer is going to affect your search results. Â  It could be that a product or category was changed, specific wording in an answer was changed etc. Â  Because answers change, are created or deleted, your search results in the past may not be the same as the search results you receive now. Â  The Keyword Search report is showing results for search words based on answers that met the criteria at that time of the search. Â  On the other hand the Search Knowledgebase report is showing the current answers that meet your search criteria right now. Â  This report is utilizing the answers table so it is in essence providing a snapshot of your knowledgebase today and what answers currently match the search term.

Global blocking of IP addresses;Answer ID 4689;IsÃ‚Â there a way toÃ‚Â blockÃ‚Â IP addresses from a specific country from hitting the end-user pages?;['Answer ID 2559'];  IP, Network configurations; Generally speaking it is not possible to Â globally Â block IP addresses with existing product functionality. Though by corralling all end-user content into one interface, separate lists of IPs for blocking could be made, but Â no specified network blocks could be guaranteed to originate only from end user versus non-end user sources. There are a variety of geographical IP databases that could potentially be used, but that would need to be a customization and this would not prevent potentially bad actors from retrieving the source directly.

Alias words increase search weight;Answer ID 4692;Why do answers that contain aliases show higher at the top of a search results report?;['Answer ID 1771', 'Answer ID 1346'];  All versions not using Knowledge Advanced search.; To remove the search weight added by alias words, the aliases must be removed from the alias list. Â  Then the answers using these words must have the alias word added to the text of the answer so that they still appear in search results. Cause: Our search algorithm adds weight to answers when an aliased word is searched, Â which may cause answers with the alias to score very high when compared to a word with even more frequent use of the alias. This functionality occurs even when all the search weight configurations are set to default: SRCH_KEY_WEIGHT, SRCH_SUBJ_WEIGHT, SRCH_DESC_WEIGHT, SRCH_BODY_WEIGHT, SRCH_ATTACH_WEIGHT, SRCH_PROD_WEIGHT and SRCH_CAT_WEIGHT.

Queued to Initial Response Interval Type in the Incident Performance table;Answer ID 4706;Why is the Queued to Initial Response interval type end time incorrect on some of these intervals?;['Answer ID 2600', 'Answer ID 4636', 'Answer ID 4161']; Ã‚Â  Analytics, Incident Performance;  Â  Â  Â  If there is a queue assignment and an initial response sent at the same time and a second response is sent at some point after this, the Queued to Initial Response interval end time will be recorded in the incident performance table as the start time from the second response. This is correct functionality. The incident must be assigned to the queue (or agent) before the response is sent for this interval type. For example, if incident is assigned to a queue on 04/16/2016 at 9:50 AM and Â the first agent Â response is sent out at the same time as the queue assignment and a second response is sent on 4/16/2016 2:35 PM, since the queue assignment and first response were performed simultaneously, the end time for the Queued to Initial Response interval is the timestamp of when the second response was sent which would be 4/16/2016 at 2:35 PM. Â  When these actions occurred simultaneously and the incident was not assigned to the queue before that initial response was sent, the appropriate end timestamp for the Queued to Initial Response interval was the timestamp of the second response sent. Â  The incident must be assigned to a queue before the first response is sent.  Â

Â  Â   Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  Following are a couple examples to help illustrate what occurs when this setting is enabled (set to 1). Please keep in mind that an agent response along with a customer update are both required in order to trigger the rel_due to be updated: EXAMPLE 1: Response Requirements configured as such: Service Intervals: Â  Â Monday - Sunday, 10:00:00 to 18:00:00 (10am to 6pm) Response Time = 480 minutes (8 hours) Resolution Time = 1440 minutes (24 hours) End-user submits an incident from the end-user pages on 04/19/18 at 10:30:00 AM.  Â Using the above response requirements, the 'incidents.rel_due' time = 04/20/18 at 10:30:00 (10:30 AM + 8 busines hours).  Â Later on in the same day, the agent updates the incident and sends a response to the end-user.  Â Then, on 04/20/18 at 19:00:00 the end-user updates the incident. Notice that is outside their business hours. Â The incident status changes to Updated and the 'incidents.rel_due' time is changed to 04/21/18 Â at 18:00:00 (start at 10:00AM and add 8 hours).  Â  EXAMPLE 2: Response Requirements configured as such: Service Intervals:  Â Monday - Friday, 08:00:00 to 18:00:00 (8am to 6pm) Response Time = 480 minutes Resolution Time = 1440 minutes End-user submits an incident from the end-user pages on 04/19/18 at 10:30:00.  Â Using the above response requirements, the 'incidents.rel_due' time = 04/20/18 at 10:30:00.  Â Later on in the same day, the agent updates the incident and sends a response to the end-user.  Â Then, on 04/20/18 (a Friday) at 07:00:00 the end-user updates the incident.  Â The incident status changes to Updated and the 'incidents.rel_due' time is 04/20/18 at 16:00:00 (start when business hours for that day start and add 8 hours to it, 08:00 + 8 hours -&gt; 16:00). NOTE:  Â In either of the abovementioned examples, if the RECALC_INCIDENT_DUE configuration setting is disabled (set to 0), Â the 'incidents.rel_due' time will remain set to 04/20/18 at 10:30:00 when a customer updates the incident. If testing on your site, you must use email or customer portal for the Customer Entry, as a manual Customer Entry via the incident in the console does not trigger the RECALC_INCIDENT_DUE functionality and will not work."

Applying a copy of a Service Level Agreement (SLA);Answer ID 4736;How to attribute the correct SLAÃ‚Â to incoming incidents, since we have several copies of some?;['Answer ID 1837', 'Answer ID 1944'];   SLAs, Incidents Oracle B2C Service;  Once a Service Level Agreement (SLA) has been modified and applied to records, and then changed, it creates a historical copy of itself. It is not possible to apply a previous copy of an SLA to a record. Therefore, if the current SLA copy does not contain the response requirements you would like, you'll want to create and apply a new SLA. NOTE: It is recommended to create a new SLA rather than editing an existing one. For newly created incidents, you can only apply the currently active copy of an SLA. So, here again, rather than editing an existing SLA, you may want to create a new one (with a unique name) to include updated response requirements. You can then modify your rules to apply the newly created SLA for incoming records.

RANK1_LBL is 0%, RANK2_LBL is 25%, RANK3_LBL is 50%, RANK4_LBL is 75%, and RANK5_LBL is 100%. As a result, if you define options_count to be 3 or 4 instead of 5, the scale will be incorrect. For example, selecting three options means the labels will be 0%, 25%, and 50%. To have your scale span the full 0-100% range with fewer than five options, you must edit the message bases. For three options, set RANK1_LBL to 0%, RANK2_LBL to 50%, and RANK3_LBL to 100%. With four options, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll set RANK1_LBL to 0%, RANK2_LBL to 33%, RANK3_LBL to 67%, and RANK4_LBL to 100%. To find these message bases, first open the Message Base editor. (Click the Configuration button and double-click Message Bases under Site Configuration.)

Rulebase compile error: Database Referential Integrity Error;Answer ID 4759;When I try to compile/activate ourÃ‚Â rules, why do I get an 'integrity'Ã‚Â error?;['Answer ID 4058'];   Business Rules  Issue   When I try to compile or activate my rulebase, I receive the following error:   Rulebase Compile Error Database Referential Integrity Error (in hier_menus table);  To resolve this, edit each of the rules listed and review the product or category selections of the condition noted in the integrity error. Â  Â If no changes are necessary, simply Save the rule. Â  Â This will update the products/categories referenced in that first condition at the database level. Â  Â This will also clear it from the integrity check when compiling the rules. Â  Â Once they have all be edited and saved, you will then be able to compile and activate without any alerts. Â  Â    Important! If this error is presented for your upgrade site, make sure to also compile and activate the rulebase for your production site as this error could be observed on your production site after the upgraded cutover.   Notes: When a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Referential IntegrityÃ¢â‚¬Â error is received, this generally means a value is being referenced within a rule that does not exist at the database level. Â  Â The Ã¢â‚¬ËœDatabase TableÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ column will help identify the type of value. Â  Â The Ã¢â‚¬ËœRule SequenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ column will show which condition or action within the rule has the incorrect reference. In the example above, if the table referenced is the hier_menus, this table holds product and category information. Â  Â In this case, it is likely a product value, sub-product, category or sub-category has been deleted since the last time business rules were activated. Â  Â At the time such a change was made, there is no alert from the product/category editor to tell you that some rules may be affected. Â  Â Instead, you receive the integrity check the next time the rules are compiled/activated. Â  Â  Please note, an integrity error can also occur if other data points are removed such as dispositions or staff accounts. For incident queues and incident statuses, an alert will appear at the time the value is deleted if there are any conflicts within the rules. Â  Â Those conflicts must be resolved, and the rulebase activated, prior to the value being deleted.

Remove Contacts from Old List;Answer ID 4802;"How does the Remove Contacts from Old List check box affect new and existing contact lists in Outreach &amp; Feedback?";['Answer ID 2457'];"   Oracle B2C Service, Outreach &amp; Feedback";"  The Remove Contacts from Old List check box is selected by default to ensure that your database tables do not get too big to manage. This check box is connected to a database variable that controls the time frame contact list data stays in your database. The database variable is set, by default, to 400 days. If a contact list has not been used in a broadcast mailing or survey and the list has not been updated for 400 days, it is considered ""old"" data and is purged. We call this ""clearing"" the contact list. Keep in mind that neither the contact list nor any of the contacts are deleted, and you can always see which contact lists were used on the Audience tab of your mailing or survey. Every time a contact list has been cleared, a contact list transaction is created. This transaction provides the following:  Displays the contacts lists that were removed on the Audit Log tab of a contact list. Ensures the contact list is not cleared for another 400 days.  You can clear the Remove Contacts from Old List check box to let contacts stay in contact lists for longer than 400 days; however, we recommend leaving this check box selected to ensure your database tables stay at a manageable size. To change the 400 day default value of the database variable, Â submit a service request to Ask Technical Support. Note: It is Â possible to change the value to less than 400 days, but it is not possible to set the value greater than 400. Notes:  A contact list will never be cleared if it exists in the audience for any transactional mailing or survey. A contact list will never be cleared if it is used in an Add to List element in a campaign or survey flow. A contact list will never be cleared if it is used in a transactional OR recurring mailing (mailings.type NOT IN (2,3)) A contact list will never be cleared if it is Â used in a mailing with an mailings.updated, mailing.scheduled, or mailings.planned date in the past 400 days. A contact list will never be cleared if it is Â used in a contact list with a contact_list.updated in the past 400 days"

New versions of Oracle B2C Service Connect and the impact on integrations;Answer ID 4805;Will an integration written to access Connect in one version continue to work without changes in subsequent new versions of Oracle B2C Service?;['Answer ID 2457'];  Oracle B2C ServiceÃ‚Â Connect API;" An integration written to access Connect in one version will continue to work without changes in the next release of our product. This has been true since the first release of Connect in our May 2010 release. This shall be true going forward. This does not mean that our product remains stagnant. When we wish to introduce new capabilities and new features we will do so as long as those additions will not break any existing integration. Thus sometimes we create a new version of the product in which to place the new features so that existing integrations will not be broken. We still continue to support the older versions, but express new features in the newer versions. If customers wish to take advantage of the new features, then they will need to use the newer versions. If not, they can stay using the version they were using previously. The new feature about CustomFields is associated with version 1.2 of Connect. If you wish to use version 1.2 and the features it presents, then the usage of CustomFields will need to be adjusted for the new structure that is outlined in the documentation. However, previous integrations using versions 1 or 1.1 can continue to use the old syntax in their integration. The version of Connect is selected using either the specific namespace for Connect Web Services for SOAP, or with the ""use"" statement within Connect for PHP. Â  If the customer wishes to continue to use the older syntax (e.g. c$pet_name), then they should use version 1 or 1.1. If the customer wishes to use the new syntax, that is associated with version 1.2. Please note that you cannot mix versions in SOAP requests. Mixing versions in Connect for PHP web pages is not a best practice and is not recommended. Lastly, version 1 and version 1.1 have been deprecated, but will be supported for a minimum of two years."

Troubleshooting on same version test sites;Answer ID 4807;How can I use my test site for troubleshooting?;['Answer ID 2543'];   Oracle B2C Service, All versions.;"  The best place to test Â end user page modifications, Â add-ins, and other customizations is on your same version test site. A test site contains a complete copy of your site's data from the time the test site Â was created. Â  This allows you to test with the same data that exists on your production site. Note that new data is not moved or synced from your production site after the test site is created however a site can be refreshed with the production site's data as required. Once created, the launch URL to the test site will be as follows: https://&lt;vhostname&gt;/cgi-bin/&lt;interfacename&gt;.cfg/php/admin/launch.php On a test Â site all contact and account records are made invalid during site creation by a ""make safe"" script. Â  The string "".invalid"" is added to all email addresses in the contacts and accounts tables so that confusing emails are not sent to your customers during testing. Â  However, Â if you add contact records to Â a test site, such as with the Data Import Wizard, automatic notifications may be sent out as this data will not be automatically made safe. Passwords are the same on a test site as on the production site when the site is created. Â  Note that if passwords expire they will need to be reset from within the CX application. Â  Since the email addresses have been made invalid, the reset password feature on the end user pages will not work. Â  If no one can log into a test site the Primary Support Contact can request that the administrator password is reset so that they can log in to manage accounts and reset passwords. Â  Customizations do not always move to or work correctly when a test site is created from a production site. Â  For Oracle B2C Service created customizations, our Oracle Consulting Â team can move the customizations to your test site. Â  Please note that this service may be included in your Â customization project. Â  Â For Â customizations that you have created, you will need to move the customizations Â to your test site for them to work properly. Â  If you require assistance moving your customizations to your test site, Oracle Consulting Â can help. To engage with this group, please contact your Sales Account Manager. Â  Â  Â  Support for Â customizations that have been set up correctly on your test site are treated the same as those on your production site. Â  For more information please refer to the Technical Support Services document available from Answer ID 2543: Contacting Oracle B2C Service Technical Support Services."

Oracle B2C Service Legacy Console removed in February 2017 Release;Answer ID 4814;What does my organization need to know about the deprecation and removal of the Oracle B2C Service Legacy Console?;['Answer ID 2543']; Ã‚Â   This article pertains to both the Oracle B2C Service Legacy ConsoleÃ‚Â and the Oracle B2C Service Enhanced Console.;  The Oracle B2C Service Legacy Console was removed in the February 2017 release of the Oracle B2C Service product. Sites that have not migrated from the Legacy Console will automatically be migrated to the Enhanced Service Console during the site update to the February 2017 release.  What is the alternative to the Legacy Console? Â   The Enhanced Service Console was introduced as part of the May 2014 release (community post: Agent Desktop and Configuration) of Oracle B2C Service as the next generation of Service Cloud console. The Enhanced Service Console provides the ability for staff members to position UI controls to optimize screen layout and customize the agent desktop to suit their personal preferences. To see a demo of the Enhanced Service Console, click on this link The Enhanced Service Console Enablement demo.   How long will we have to use the Legacy Console?  The Oracle B2C Service Legacy Console began its deprecation period on May 2014. Before the February 2017 release of the Oracle B2C Service, sites that are using the Legacy Console are strongly encouraged to migrate to the Enhanced Service Console as soon as possible.  Â Sites that have not migrated from the Legacy Console will automatically be migrated to the Enhanced Service Console during the site update to the February 2017 release. Defects will no longer be fixed in the Legacy Console.   How do I know if my organization is Â using the Legacy Console? Â   Here is a screen shot of both consoles. The one on the left is the Legacy Console and the one on the right is the Enhanced Console.   Click to enlarge image   Here are some additional tips to help distinguish between the Legacy and Enhanced Consoles:        How do I migrate users to the Enhanced Service Console?  Below are the different scenarios depending on your site:   New sites implemented on May 2014 and newer releases already Â use the Enhanced Service Console. No change is needed.   Sites without addins that update to Â November 2014 and newer releases will automatically have the Enhanced Consoled enabled on the target update Â version. No change is needed.   Sites with addins that update to May 2014 and newer, from a release prior to May 2014, will have the Legacy Console enabled by default. Oracle recommends sites with addins complete the update with the Legacy Console first and then adopt the Enhanced Console on a per profile basis as a separate effort after the update project is complete. Â    Sites with addins that update to the February 2017 will automatically be updated to the Enhanced Console enabled on the target update version. No change is needed.   Where can we ask questions about Legacy and Enhanced Service Consoles?  In addition to your account team, the Â Agent Desktop and Configuration Â forum in the Oracle B2C Service Community is a great place for questions on all Oracle B2C Service consoles and functionality.

Incident Thread in two columns;Answer ID 4826;Why is the incident thread presented in two columns whenÃ‚Â I use the Rich Text Incident Thread control in an incident workspace?;['Answer ID 2814', 'Answer ID 7790', 'Answer ID 4827', 'Answer ID 2451'];   Rich Text Thread Control, Incident Workspace Design Oracle B2C Service (OSvC);"  This Â behavior is due to the ""Thread Orientation"" Â setting on the Incident Thread relationship control Â in the workspace being used. Â This control allows you to modify the entry type from the default vertical split to the horizontal thread orientation that you may be more comfortable with. The thread orientation will generally only change as a result of a site update where the Rich Text editor is being employed for the first time, or workspace update where the Incident Thread control is altered. There are three (3) Â view types available in the Incident Thread control, and each has Â its own advantages and drawbacks that are best evaluated Â by you for your particular business case(s). The view types and their attributes are:  Vertical - This is the default type, and results in a two-column view split side-by-side. This allows for a new entry to be made while viewing previous entries to the right of the new entry. Scrolling through previous thread entries on the right does not lose the view of the new entry on the left. Similarly, scrolling through a long new entry on the left does not change the focus of the previous thread entry on the right. Horizontal - This results in a single column response view with a single scroll bar. Scrolling through previous entries can result in a loss of visibility to the new entry. Horizontal with Splitter - This results in a single column response view with two rows, each with their own scroll bar. Scrolling through previous thread entries below the new entry does not lose the view of he new entry above. Similarly, scrolling through a long new entry does not change the focus of the previous entries below.  This option menu where these options are controlled can be found in the Workspaces editor, which you will find by navigating to Configuration -&gt; Application Appearance -&gt; Workspaces. Please note that this editor will be labeled Workspaces / Workflows for sites that have Workflows enabled as described in Â Answer ID 2814: Desktop Workflow.. Once you have opened the correct Incident workspace in the editor, this option can be changed by selecting the Rich Text Incident Thread control (where you would normally see threads populate in an open incident) and navigating to the Design tab on the Ribbon. Within the Options section of the Design tab Â of the Ribbon Â you will find a ""Thread Orientation"" menu, which will give you options on how the thread entry view should be managed. The default is vertical. Horizontal and Horizontal with Splitter are the alternatives that you may wish to try. NOTE: To verify which thread control is in place and update it (if needed) to the Rich Text Thread Control, this is done by opening the workspace for edit. With the content of the Messages tab highlighted, select the Design tab to see which control is used. If using the Incident Thread control, delete it. Then, select the Insert Control tab and drag/drop the Rich Text Incident Thread control to the Messages tab area. You can then verify/set the Thread Orientation from the Design tab. For additional information on Rich Text Incident Thread Control, refer to Answer ID 7790: Adopting the Rich Text Incident Thread Control The profile an agent account is using can be found in Answer ID 4827: Determining which profile an agent account is using. The incident workspace an agent account's profile Â is using can be determined by following steps 1 and 2 found in Answer ID 2451: Assigning workspaces to staff profiles."

This report is called ""Staff Accounts by Profile"" (report ID 13067). The report can be found in two ways. The first way is to navigate to Configuration &gt; Staff Management Â &gt; Staff Accounts by Profile. Double-clicking this report will display a list of users, including account ID, first and last name, login, group, and phone. The second way to find the report is to navigate to Analytics &gt; Reports Explorer. Â The report is located in the following folder path: Public Reports &gt; Site Administration &gt; Staff Management. Double-click the report to open. You can search within this report in two ways. The first is by clicking the Search button in the Data Set section of the Home tab of the Ribbon, which will search by re-running the report and allow for filtering by account status (active, temporarily disabled, permanently disabled) and/or account last name. The second is by using the find keyboard shortcut ""Ctrl-F"" which will search through the displayed list for a particular string."

Incidents in wrong queue due to Escalation levels not being set;Answer ID 4831;Why did a number of incidents not automatically change queue and escalate per our rules?;['Answer ID 2814', 'Answer ID 7790', 'Answer ID 4827', 'Answer ID 2451'];  Business Rules, Escalation Rules, Revalidate option Issue  We recentlyÃ‚Â discovered a large number of incidents in the wrong queue, significantly out of SLA. They should have been escalated by rules. Those incidents did not automatically change the queue.;" If you have the ""Revalidate"" option checked for the escalation rule, this revalidation process will check the conditions each time the incident is updated. The important thing to note is that if the escalation rule is contained in a function, the conditions that Â are revalidated include the conditions in the rule which calls this escalation function. For example, in the following scenario: In State ""02. In progress"" Rule: ""Call Escalation Function"" If condition: Â  Â incident.status = ""Escalate"" Then: Call ""Escalation Function"" Functions: ""Escalation Function"" Rule: Escalation Chain rule If conditions: Â  Â incident.status in ""Escalate, Updated"" Then: set escalation level +1 hour from now (Revalidate)  If an incident is created and set to a status of Â  Â ""Escalate"", the incident triggers the ""Call Escalation Function"" which triggers the ""Escalation Chain Rule"". This rule sets up a pending action to set the escalation level in one hour. If the customer updates the incident before the hour is up, the status gets set to Updated. The conditions of the escalation are revalidated at this time. The conditions which are checked in the above example are:  Â  Â  Â  Â  If condition: Â  Â incident.status = ""Escalate""  Â  Â  Â  Â  If condition: Â  Â incident.status in ""Escalate, Updated"" Since the status is Updated, the second condition is met but the first is not. The pending escalation action criteria is considered no longer valid and is removed. It's generally a better practice Â to have your conditions in the escalation rule inside the function instead of the rule which calls the function.  "

Connect Web Services for SOAP access;Answer ID 4832;"Why am I receiving an ""Access Denied..."" message when trying to access the Connect Web Services for SOAP?";['Answer ID 8270']; Ã‚Â  Connect Web Services for SOAP (CWS) API, All Versions;" The RightNow Connect and API Access feature must be enabled on your site. This is enabled by default on all sites and interfaces. Â For further information on this refer to Answer ID 8270: Enabling Connect for Web Services API You Â will also need to update the profile by enabling the ""Public SOAP API"" option under the 'Administration' tab in the permissions window of the profile. Â  Â In order to Â enable this option, please follow the steps provided below: 1. Â Go to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles. 2. Â Open the specific profile. 3. Click on 'Permissions' in the ribbon. 4. Click on the 'Administration' tab. 5. Check the box next to 'Public SOAP API'. 6. Â Click Save. You might want to test the username and password by logging into the Oracle B2C Service console to confirm that the username and password are valid. Please note, it is best practice to set up a specific account only for RightNow Connect API access, however, Â Oracle B2C Service will support either method you choose. SOAP API requires SSL for security purposes. Please verify that the site has a valid certificate. NOTES: A best practice is to ensure the 'password expires' checkbox is unchecked. Some integrations are hard coded with the password, so if the password changes it could break the integration."

"""There was a problem with your S/MIME Signature Certificate"" error message";Answer ID 4853;Why are some contacts receiving an error message when trying to update an incident?;['Answer ID 8270']; Ã‚Â   Oracle B2C ServiceÃ‚Â Mailboxes, Techmail  Issue   Some contacts are receiving an error when trying to update an incident:   There was a problem with your S / MIME Signature Certificate: The certificate used to sign your email is untrusted. (The incident was not updated. Please correct the above problem and send your email again.);"  Â  This rejection notification message appears when an untrusted S/MIME email certificate in the senders email is received in the Oracle Service mailbox. RightNow is indicating that the messages are signed with a certificate from a Certificate Authority that you have not chosen to trust. The security settings in the mailbox are specified on the Security tab within the Service Mailbox. When emails are received containing an untrusted S/MIME certificate, they are discarded by the techmail application, unless that mailbox has the ""Import untrusted certificates"" checkbox selected in the Service Mailbox configuration. To resolve this issue, you may consider selecting the ""Import untrusted certificates"" option on your specific service mailbox configuration. The only concern here is that the system would store invalid certificates associated with the contact and these cannot be purged by default in the future. Another option is to disable signature certificates entirely. This is done through selecting the ""Do not use S/MIME signature certificates"" checkbox in the S/MIME section in the Security Tab in the Service Mailbox. Please note, you may want to review these mailbox settings with your email administrator to be sure that it is within your mail security procedures. Note: When working with S/MIME, if a contact sends an email using S/MIME the email can be blocked by Techmail regardless of your settings above Â if the email fails the integrity check. If a signed Â email is altered in any way during transit from the sender to Oracle, this will cause the integrity check to fail. This check Â does not distinguish between potentially legitimate reasons for the failure like Â SMTP forwarding, email clients modifying attachments, anti-virus, etc... Starting in the 18B version of Oracle B2C Service there is now a sub option under ""Do not use S/MIME signature certificates"" that allows the mailbox to ignore certificate integrity errors altogether. If the ""ignore certificate integrity sign errors"" checkbox is marked, Â Oracle B2C Service does not identify signed messages that have been altered during Â transit.  "

When deleted chat incident from Contact record, the Chat ID still showing in chat reports;Answer ID 4855;When deleting a chat incident from a Contact record, why is the Chat ID associated to the incident still showing in the chat reports?;['Answer ID 1960']; Ã‚Â  May 2010 and newer releases;"  Â  When you delete a chat incident from a contact record, the functionality does not work the same as when a contact record is deleted and all incidents associated with that record are also deleted. Chats are only purged by the agedatabase utility per the value set in the CHATS_PURGE_DAYS configuration setting. Â  Â This setting specifies the age in days of chat records that will be purged by the agedatabase utility. Â  For example, when this Â configuration setting is set to a value of '180', any chats Â that were created on Â a specific date Â would not be purged from the system until Â 180 days later. Â  Â At that time, you would no longer see those chats Â showing Â in your reports.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.

Font size discrepancies between what agents see and what shows in response emails;Answer ID 4857;How can I make theÃ‚Â font size in the response email the same as what I set in the incident?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Visual Email, Incidents, Workspace Options November 2011Ã‚Â and newer;"  This behavior is due to fonts in the Rich Text Incident Thread control being listed in pixels rather than points. The formula for converting pixels to points is points = (pixels * 72) / 96. This results in smaller fonts displayed in Outlook or Gmail than display within the Oracle B2C Service application. The following table lists examples of common font points and their Oracle B2C Service application equivalents for your reference:          Â  Â  Word Â        Â Oracle B2C Service          Â Points       Â Pixels          Â 6       Â 8          Â 6.75       Â 9          Â 7.5       Â 10          Â 8.25       Â 11          Â 9       Â 12          Â 9.75       Â 13          Â 10.5       Â 14          Â 11.25       Â 15          Â 12       Â 16          Â 12.75       Â 17          Â 13.5       Â 18          Â 14.25       Â 19         15 Â        Â 20         At times there can be inconsistent text fonts and sizes when data is entered from multiple channels. For example, all standard content might be in one font and size, what is pasted in from a Word document or another program in a different font and size, and what is directly entered into the thread with default font and size yet another. To allow for these discrepancies, the System Default font is available. The font displayed for this font setting is determined by the displaying entity on the end user side, such as the mail client, web browser, etc. Once the response is satisfactory but before it is sent, the entire body of text can be selected via the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-A and the ""System Default"" setting chosen from the list of fonts. Note: Using the Â ""Paste as Text"" option when copying from Word or another program will Â paste the content without the HTML formatting. The content is then handled based on the font settings in the rich text editor (i.e. System Default or whatever it is set to). To Paste as Text right click and select Paste as Text or use CTRL + Shift + V. Setting a Default Font: Within the incident workspace, a default font can be set by modifying the options within the workspace used. Â  To do this, use these steps: 1. Open the workspace for editing (Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces/Workflows) 2. Click into the Messages tab area 3. Select the Design ribbon from the top 4. From the Default Font options, select the font and size from the drop down menus 5.

"Pages display a ""this page has insecure content"" warning";Answer ID 4862;"Why do some pages display a message ""this page has insecure content"" warning when loading a web page?";['Answer ID 5168'];   End-user pages;"  When the message below is displayed, it means that a web page is trying to display elements using both secure (HTTPS/SSL) and non-secure (HTTP) web server connections. Security Warning Do you want to view only the webpage content that was delivered securely? This webpage contains content that will not be delivered using a secure HTTPS connection, which could comprimise the security of the entire webpage. Â  Â   This means that the page that is attempting to display information from a non-secure server is located on a secured server. This message generally is displayed when a page loads such as: https://anypage (on a secured server) is loading additional content such as http://anypicture which is on a non-secured server. The discrepancy is that the additional content ""anypicture"" is coming from ""http:"" server loading onto a page that is secure (located on a ""https:"" server). You can choose to do the following to get rid of the message:  1) Move the additional content (in the example ""anypicture"") to a secure server so you don't get the message and the link in the page would be ""https://anypicture"" OR 2) Depending on your business needs you can change the original ""anypage"" to be a ""http:"" link instead of ""https:"" link.  The end-user customer has two options available - By choosing to display all data you will ignore the message that any non-secure data will then be displayed on the secure web page. By choosing to display only secure data, you will not display the additional data and the page may not format correctly because the insecure data will not be displayed. Additional Note: The risk of displaying mixed content is that a non-secure web page or script might be able to access information from the secure content. Internet Explorer uses an encrypted protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to access secure web pages. These pages use the prefix HTTPS, while regular web pages use HTTP."

Unable to edit a backup or default file in File Manager;Answer ID 4933;Why am I unable to update the backup files in the File Manager?;['Answer ID 1001'];   February 2010 throughÃ‚Â November 2012, File Manager;  The current product functionality does not allow you to edit or overwrite the files in the backup and default directories, these files are only to be viewed and downloaded. The File Manager automatically saves a backup file in the backup directory when a file is uploaded, edited, or restored. It also maintains permanent, read-only copies of the originally installed default files in the default directory. However, files that have been edited can be restored from the default file or the backup copy using the restore function. You can restore a file to the most recent backup copy in the backup directory or to the original default file in the default directory. You might choose this option if you are having problems editing a file and want to revert to an earlier version. Read-only, backup copies of all files accessible through the File Manager are created in each default directory during installation to serve as permanent backup copies. Before a file is overwritten (edited, uploaded, or restored), a backup copy is saved in the backup directory. When you use the 'restore' function and there is both a backup and default file, you are prompted to choose which file you want to restore. If only one file exists, either a default file or a backup file, a dialog box prompts you to confirm the restoration from the existing file. In order to restore a file from the backup or default directory by following the detailed steps provided below.  1. Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane and then double-click File Manager under Site Configuration. 2. Navigate to the directory that contains the file you want to restore. 3. Click the Â Restore button in the Action column of the file you want to restore. A warning message asks you to verify that you want to restore the file. 4. Click the OK button. If both backup and default files exist, you are prompted to choose either the backup or default file.  5. To restore from the default file, select the Default radio button and click the Commit button to return to the directory list of files. 6. Â To restore from the backup file, select the Backup radio button and click the Commit button to return to the list of files.

Generic Contact records for Oracle B2C Service Support;Answer ID 4943;Why areÃ‚Â generic contact records not allowed for Oracle B2C Service Support?;['Answer ID 2543'];  TheÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service Support Pages located at http //cx.rightnow.com/; A generic support contact record with privileges to submit incidents to Â Oracle B2C Service Technical Support is not allowed for security purposes. Our team needs to validate that who they are speaking with has been authorized to receive information about your customer's data. Please refer to Â Answer ID 2543: Contacting Oracle B2C Service Technical Support Services for the Technical Support Services Document which will describe only a few of the laws we must comply with for customer data. Using a generic contact will result in no service for security reasons or degraded service. Aside from the security issue: using a generic contact will prevent Technical Support from providing effective support for your technical issues. Each designated support contact must have an individual email address and phone number. This allows Technical Support to contact the individual to assist in troubleshooting. Shared generic email distribution addresses prolong or prevent this communication from happening. If you need a distribution list to be notified on your end, please set that up in your mail server with rules to forward items from Â oraclerightnowsupport@custhelp.com to their internal distribution list. When we find these, we will notify the generic contact that individuals with correct (named emails at the company domain) email addresses and phone numbers must be set up for the named contacts and the generic contact must be decommissioned. We will disable generic contacts if they continue to be used after we notify.

Â Archived incidents can be accessed via the Archive Console (see How to access and use the archive console).   Given their ancillary purpose, records from many other tables in the database that are associated with an archived incident are removed from the database or de-referenced from the archived incident without being archived, ensuring that all related data is properly cleared from the database.  Â Tables containing ancillary data are listed below.   Records are removed from the database but are not archived bounced_msgs channel_response_queues chats cloud_results cobrowse_sessions document_tags gap_tree inc_best_answers inc_bounced_msgs inc_performance incident_draft_resp2fattach incident_fattach_log incidents_draft_resp2fattach integration_errors kf_sa_log labels ma_trans mail_queue mail_recipients message_trans milestone_instances notes offer_trans osn_incident_conversations phrases question_sessions queue_stats rule_alerts rule_log tasks tmp_keyword user_trans visibility   For additional information about any of the tables listed above, consult the Data Dictionary (see Accessing the Data Dictionary).   Once an incident is archived and transformed into an XML file, it cannot be reversed and cannot be re-inserted into the database.  Â While the XML format allows for hierarchical storage of the related data in a compressed form, it is not possible to easily extract it and re-insert it into the database.  Â For this reason, ensure that your archiving settings are tuned to archive those incidents expected to be accessed infrequently.

Chat Session duration is off several seconds;Answer ID 5064;Why is agent chat session duration timer showing an offset?;['Answer ID 7038', 'Answer ID 2611']; Ã‚Â Ã‚Â   Chat / Agent console Oracle B2C Service;  The first step to resolving this Â is to have an affected agent step through the following: 1. Log out of chat and the Oracle B2C Service Â application 2. Confirm the Windows system clock on their workstation is accurate. - This can be done by comparing to an atomic clock or searching your local city at http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/ - Update the time on the workstation exactly (down to the second) 3. Once the system clock is set correctly, have the agent login to CX and chat 4. Accept a chat session and monitor the duration time Another scenario that can happen is that, after using the steps above, the duration is corrected, but Â eventually the duration Â becomes off again. Based on that, it is likely Â a problem with the workstation's CMOS battery which is used to keep time. Â  Â If the battery is almost out of power then the system clock could lose time. Â  Â  NOTE: If that is the case, Â a change in functionality Â in versions February 2011 and later will ensure an incorrect system clock does not affect chat durations for agents. Notes: In Â versions Â prior to February 2011, Â the duration was being calculated using the difference between the start time (sent from the chat server) and the current time (defined by the system clock). Â  If the two clocks are out of sync, the duration will be incorrect based on that difference. Â  Adjusting the system clock will correct this behavior. Â  This functionality has changed and now both the start time and end time come from the system clock. Additionally, an incorrect duration will not affect any reports used for evaluating agent performance. Â  Â This particular timer only shows while the agent is working the chat. Â  Â It is for their convenience and does not impact statistics. Â  Â Once the chat is closed, the duration is calculated using time stamps that were recorded by the server.

Existing SSL Certificate Renewals;Answer ID 5081;What are the steps for renewingÃ‚Â an existing Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Certificate?;['Answer ID 7988'];   Secure Socket Layer, SSL Certificates, Expire, Renewal;  The Oracle B2C Service Operations team will create a proactive service request for customer's regarding their SSL Certificate's upcoming expiration. The service request will be created 90 days in advance of the certificate's expiration date. Within the proactive service request will be a CSR and it should be used to renew the certificate. Please make sure you purchase and download your cert in standard x509 PEM format, and use this same format to upload to Oracle. Â   You can renew your certificate using Configuration Assistant Self Service. Refer to Â Answer ID 7988: Managing SSL Certificates using Configuration Assistant for step by step information on this feature.  Â  If using an uncommon Â certificate authority, update the proactive service request or submit a new one. Attempting to upload a cert from a minor or independent cert authority will often result in errors within self-service, as our infrastructure does not always have the required root certs Â in advance. Â   Most Certificate Authorities (CAs) Â will allow you to do this up to 90 days in advance without losing any time on the certificate. When purchasing the certificate, please choose Apache or Apache Mod-SSL as the server platform.

Guided Assistance 4,000 byte limit on steps;Answer ID 5084;Is it possible to extendÃ‚Â the 4,000 byte limit on steps for Guided Assistance?;['Answer ID 1731'];   Guided Assistance;"  It is not possible to extend the 4,000 byte limit. This limit is Â hard coded into the product. Â Our development team has set this Â limit so that memory can flow at the highest level of operational efficiency. The limit applies to both questions and answers in Guided Assistance. Â  Â At the database level, the content of questions and answers are stored in a database table named 'labels', and that table has a length limit of 4000 bytes on its column. As such, questions and answers can not have more than 4000 bytes of content. When images are used in an answer / question, the image itself is stored as a file on our server, and referenced via html &lt;a&gt; tag in answer / question content. Â  Although the image itself may be very large, in the question / answers, it's reference will be something like &lt;a href='.../image.jpg'&gt;, so it will not exceed the 4000 byte limit."

Marketing CAN SPAM Configuration;Answer ID 5085;What is Oracle B2C ServiceÃ‚Â CAN-SPAM compliance in mailings and surveys?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Outreach and Feedback, Mailings and Surveys, SPAM compliance;  Â  Oracle B2C Service's Â recommendations are to follow the best practices as stated in our online documentation. Â  Â Oracle B2C Service helps you identify CAN-SPAM compliance issues. Â  Â Legal definitions and penalties for spam vary among countries. Therefore, it is important to stay abreast of current and pending legislation in the United States and other countries. There are many sites that you can check to stay current with the laws and to make sure your site is compliant. When creating a mailing or survey with an invitation message, Â Oracle B2C Service automatically checks that the message contains a physical address and an unsubscribe link, and honors global opt-in preferences. The remaining requirements must be manually verified by the staff member saving the mailing or survey. For further details refer to the 'Check CAN-SPAM compliance in mailings' or the Â 'CAN-SPAM compliance in surveys' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Standard report is queuing;Answer ID 5094;Why is my standard report queuing when it has never done so before?;['Answer ID 4493', 'Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   Standard Reports Oracle B2C Service Analytics, All versions  Issue   One of our standard reports now processes too much data and wants to queue every time it is run. We would like to fix.;"  This behavior is likely because the report has been set to ""deferred execution"". Â  It will be set to deferred execution any time the report takes longer than 60 seconds to run and will remain deferred until Â an individual manually disables this option within the Â report. Â  For a standard report, it is also possible to change the data source. Running reports from the Report Database allows them to run larger queries (i.e. historical month- or year-end reports). Use the steps outlined below to change the deferred and data source options: 1. Â  Open the standard report in Edit mode (right-click &gt; Edit from Explorer or Edit Report Definitions from navigation area) 2.  Â From the ribbon, select 'More Options. (November 2016 and earlier, the 'More Options' button is in the lower left-hand corner of the report area.) 3. Â  In the ""Edit Settings"" pop-up window, uncheck ""Set report to deferred execution"" 4. Â  Set Data Source as needed 5. Â  Click ""OK"" 6. Â  Save the report  NOTE: Â  If the report becomes deferred again, please ensure your agents have not adjusted the search filters in a way that would cause the report to process too much data and thus want to queue.  For information on modifying the deferred or data source options for custom reports, refer to Answer ID 4493: Custom report always queues now, when it has not in the past.

Customizations on refreshed test sites and upgrade sites;Answer ID 5129;Will any customizations be lost when test sites are refreshed or upgraded?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 7850'];   Test Sites, All versions;  When a test site is refreshed, all files are copied from the production site to the test site. Any customization files or integrations that require code changes in order to integrate with test servers will not function on the test site until the appropriate modifications have been implemented. The most commonly affected files are generally found in the ext_evt, xml_api, and the custom scripts directories, but Add-Ins, scheduled data transfers, and cron jobs are also at risk. These test site configuration tasks are not included in the test site creation and therefore must be implemented by the customer or Managed services. If you require assistance with configuring customizations on the test site, please contact sales to engage with Oracle Managed Services. For more information regarding a test site refresh, refer to Answer ID 7850: How to request a test site be created or refreshed for Oracle B2C Service.

"""The script is too large to be stored"" error message when saving a script in Scripts Explorer";Answer ID 5141;"WhenÃ‚Â going toÃ‚Â Scripts Explorer and saving a particular script, why it is throwing the error message ""The script is too large to be stored""?";['Answer ID 5168'];"   Agent Scripts Oracle B2C Service  Issue   WhenÃ‚Â going toÃ‚Â Scripts Explorer and saving a particular script we receive the following error message:    ""The following problems are identified during the validation of this script  Errors: Ã‚Â Ã‚Â The script is too large to be stored  Warnings: Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â There are no paths to the 'page name', therefore this page can not be achieved""";  There is a maximum size for agents scripts. The maximum size for agent scripts is 1mb. Â  Â This limit is not a limitation set by the developers. Â  Â The limitation is a byproduct of the .Net framework. Currently the only way to see the size of the agent script is to export it. Â  Â This can be done by following these steps: 1. Â  From the Scripts explorer, right-click the script you want to export and select Open. The script opens. 2. Â  Click the RightNow button and select Export Script. The Save As window opens. 3. Â  Select the directory where you want to save the script definition file and type the file name. 4. Â  Click the Save button to save the script definition file. 5. Â  You can now view the properties of the exported xml file for the size. Note: The exported file size will be less than 1mb because the changes have not been saved which may be pushing it over that limit. Possible Workaround: Separate sections of the agent script into smaller agent scripts and design your rules accordingly. For additional information, refer to the 'Agent Scripts' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

A permanently disabled staff account still receives emails via an incident rule;Answer ID 5143;Why isÃ‚Â a permanently disabled staff account still receiving emails via an incident rule?;['Answer ID 5168'];al  Staff Account, Incidents, Rules; When permanently disabling a staff account which is being referenced by a rule, you will receive a pop up window notifying you of this. It is best, at this point, to go to the rule(s) being referenced and edit them to remove the reference of the Â staff account you want to permanently disable. If you proceed with permanently disabling the staff account without first modifying the rule(s) to remove the reference of the staff account, then the rule will continue to send notifications to this staff account. In addition, the permanently disabled staff account will no longer display within the rule to deselect. You will want to Â delete the rule action and re-add the rule action, only selecting the staff accounts you want the rule to send a notification out to.

Unable to create incidents via email;Answer ID 5170;Why am I unable to create an incident when sending an email to one of our Outreach mailboxes?;['Answer ID 1960'];   Outreach email, Incidents, Configuration setting;"  When a user sends an email to an Outreach mailbox where there is no contact record in the system with the same email address as the ""From"" address of the incoming email and the configuration setting EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE_MA is disabled, they receive an email back with the message ""Your request for assistance cannot be accepted because your email address is not registered with an existing account"". The configuration setting EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE_MA can be enabled so that a new contact can send an email to your Outreach mailbox and a new incident will be created and a new contact record will be created (if a contact does not already exist). Here is the definition of the EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE_MA configuration: If enabled, a new contact record is created when an email message in an Outreach mailbox is processed which contains an email address that does not already exist in a contact record in the database. The contact record will be populated with the contact's email address as well as the contact's first and last names if they can be extracted from the email headers. If the first and last names cannot be extracted, EGW_DEFAULT_FIRST_NAME and EGW_DEFAULT_LAST_NAME will be used. The user ID for the contact will be set to the contact's email address, and the password will be set based on how the EGW_PASSWD_CREATE setting is configured. Default is enabled (Yes).

Definition of this configuration: Â  Specifies the location and file used to direct users to the Login page when they must log in to access end-user pages. The value of this setting also provides a redirect if a user clicks an incident link in an email without the login cookie set. If creating a custom login page, update this setting to reference the folder and file name of your custom page. For example, utils/custom_login_form.

Wrong language or character set in console incident created from email;Answer ID 5182;Why is an incident created by email in theÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service console displaying the wrong characters when compared to the original email?;['Answer ID 2663'];  Foreign language, ISO, Email header;" The language display, or transcoding, for an incident created by email is based on the actual language encoding from the email Â header (Content-Type: text/html; charset=""ISO-8859-1"", for example). This charset is used to display the message. The customer may not know what charset was used when the email was created. How the message displays may be different than what is set on the incident itself, as the charset does not impact the language detection on an incoming email. Language detection occurs on every message, and a proper lang_id is set on the incident if: The site has a language interface matching the detected language of the message. The content and subject have sufficient content to evaluate against the language-detection software. Setting the language ID on an incident based on email content is determined as follows: 1. Â  Â Language-detection software reviews the content of the body (and subject if necessary) in order to Â determine the language in the message. If the site has an interface of the matching language installed, then the code will set the language based on what is detected. 2. Â  If the language cannot be determined from the content or subject, or the detected language does not have a matching interface, then the language Â ID is set to the language of the interface for the mailbox to which it was sent. Incidents generated for techmail processing errors will have the language ID set to match that of the current interface.

Limit products based on interface visibility within answer workspace;Answer ID 5184;Is it possible to limit the products visible within the answer workspace?;['Answer ID 524', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answer Workspace, Options, Products and Categories Oracle B2C Service,Ã‚Â All versions;"  With multiple interfaces, the functionality associated with the Administration visibility settings behave differently for incidents and answers, as detailed in Making a product or category specific to one interface. When editing an answer, the behavior by design is that ALL products listed in the Products table will display for ALL interfaces when editing an answer, regardless of the Admin visibility configuration for specific interfaces. A product will display Â when editing answers from any interface, even though the admin visibility is enabled only for one interface, regardless of the languages of the interfaces. This allows knowledge engineers to use a single interface for editing and publishing answers. A product will not be displayed in the Products and Categories tab of the Answer workspace in the following two circumstances: 1. None of the checkboxes for Administration visibility are selected in the Products/Categories/Dispositions area for the particular product i.e. the product is hidden on ALL interfaces. OR 2. Using the ""Limit by Profile Interface(s)"" option on the Answer Workspace, when the staff account's Profile does not have access to the interfaces where the Product is visible. Â  For example:  Â   Â  A site has three interfaces: English, Spanish, French.  Â   Â  AccountA is logged into the French or English interface.  Â   Â  AccountA's profile does NOT have access to the Spanish interface and ProductA has Admin visibility on the Spanish interface only (so ProductA has no visibility on English and French interfaces).  Â   Â  ProductA will NOT be shown in the Answer workspace control for AccountA if the Limit option is ON. By clicking the button shown below within the editor, this limits products and categories displayed on the Products and Categories relationship item. They're limited to those that have administration visibility only on the interfaces to which the staff memberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s profile has access, instead of all interfaces of the site. Note that this option does not modify the expected behavior described at the beginning of this answer. It will make it easier for you if you want to reach the circumstances described in Â #1 above, by eliminating the product's visibility of the interfaces where the profile does not have access.  For additional information on this and other options, refer to the 'Options properties' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Single Sign-On Agent Login Process;Answer ID 5197;What is the process when an agent logs in and identity provider initiatedÃ‚Â single sign onÃ‚Â is setup?;['Answer ID 5168'];   August 2014Ã‚Â and newer, Single Sign-On (SSO);  The following process occurs when single sign-on is enabled for agents who work in the Oracle B2C Service console. 1. An agent enters a user name and password to log in to the organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity provider (such as a PingFederate Server-based application). When the information is verified, the agent is logged in to the identity provider. 2. The identity provider displays a list of service providers, including Oracle Oracle B2C Service, that the agent can connect to. 3. The agent selects Oracle B2C Service. 4. The identity provider generates a signed SAML 2.0 assertion using the account login, email address, account ID, or a staff account custom field as the assertion subject. Refer to Identifying the SAML subject for agent login. 5. The identity provider then submits the assertion to the Oracle Oracle B2C Service SSO launch page using HTTP POST binding (since that is the only binding method Oracle B2C Service supports). The SSO launch page is similar to the standard launch page except that it automatically starts the ClickOnce URL, which logs the agent in after validation. 6. Oracle B2C Service decodes and verifies the assertion and validates the account by confirming that the assertion matches an account in the Oracle B2C Service database. 7. Oracle B2C Service redirects the agent to the ClickOnce URL, which signals the installer to use the SSO login instead of the standard login, and passes the necessary parameters for automatic login. 8. Oracle B2C Service verifies the account using the parameters of the ClickOnce URL for authentication. If necessary, Oracle B2C Service is downloaded and installed. The application is then launched, and the agent is logged in to the Oracle B2C Service Console. Beginning in May 2015, Service Provider Initiated login is supported.   For additional information, refer to the 'Single Sign-on Support in Oracle B2C Service' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Single Sign-On Customer Login Process;Answer ID 5198;What is the process when customers login and single sign-on is enabled?;['Answer ID 5168'];   May 2011 and newer releases, Single Sign-On (SSO);"  The following process occurs when single sign-on is enabled for customers logging in to the RightNow Customer Portal pages. 1. A customer enters a user name and password to log in to an identity provider. When the identity provider verifies the information, the customer is logged in. 2. The identity provider displays a list of service providers, including the RightNow Customer Portal, that the customer can connect to. 3. The customer selects the customer portal. 4. The identity provider generates a signed SAML 2.0 assertion using the contactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s email address, contact record ID, login name, or a contact custom field as the assertion subject. 5. The identity provider then submits the assertion, using HTTP POST binding (since that is the only binding method Oracle B2C Service supports), to the customer portal openlogin controller at http://&lt;your_site&gt;.custhelp.com/ci/openlogin/saml/. This controller calls the SSO validation and logs in contacts. 6. RightNow CX decodes the assertion, validates the customer by confirming that the assertion matches a contact record in the RightNow database, and logs the customer in on the customer portalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Support Home page. (A redirect parameter can specify that a different page opens instead. Refer to Redirecting after login.)

No value return when using Relative Time;Answer ID 5208;Why does relative time, rel_time, sometimes give no value?;['Answer ID 2240', 'Answer ID 1932'];  Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Response Requirements, Incidents, Analytics; The interval length (the time element reported for each interval) can be reported in two ways: Relative time takes into account the default response requirements or the service level agreement that is applied to the incident. Relative time uses inc_performance.rel_time and calculates the time of the interval (in seconds) by including only the time that occurred during defined business hours. Therefore, if an incident is created at 3:00AM and responded to at 8:02AM, if you business hours start at 8:00AM, the relative time for the Created to Initial Response is 120 seconds (namely, 2 minutes). When using relative time, it is possible for no value to be returned. Absolute time is simply the difference between the two date and time values. For example, date_diff(inc_performance.time_end, inc_performance.time_start). This provides the total amount of time between the two times (in seconds) for the interval. Therefore, if an incident is created at 3:00AM and responded to at 8:02AM, if you business hours start at 8:00AM, the absolute time for the Created to Initial Response is Â 18120 seconds (or 5 hours and 2 minutes). To avoid having no value returned in reports, you could try incorporating absolute time or change the response requirements hours to include more hours of the day. Response Requirements: You can specify response requirements, work hours, an holidays that are specific to the SLA. The response requirements of the SLA override the default response requirements. This allows you to define more stringent response requirements based on the level of the service being provided by the SLA. This suggests to me that you might also want to make sure your SLA's are set to the appropriate hours as well. These configurations can also be found under the Service configuration options.

Changes to ac_audit_log table;Answer ID 5235;Why is there an 'Edited' transactionÃ‚Â shown on the Audit Log for my report even though I did not edit it?;['Answer ID 1560']; Ã‚Â   February 2012 and newer releases,Ã‚Â Analytics Oracle B2C Service Site Updates;  As part of the update process beginning in version February 2012, reports are not updated during cutover. Â  Rather, the reports are updated the first time they are accessed after cutover. Â  This operation goes through the Oracle RightNow standard API so if any changes are needed as a result of the update logic, an audit log entry will be recorded in the ac_audit_log table which will show as an 'Edited' transaction in the Audit Log of your report. Â  The ac_audit_log table stores transaction information on when a report is Created, Edited, Generated, Scheduled etc. and who created the transaction. Â  Please access the Data Dictionary for your site for more specific information on fields stored within the ac_audit_log table. In version August 2012, there was a change in the way Oracle RightNow stores references to message bases in report definitions. Â  Due to this and the change in how reports are not updated at cutover, when you update to Â the August 2012 version Â of the product the first run of a report or the first open of a report in edit mode post cutover will result in an 'Edited' transaction Â being written to the ac_audit_log table. Â  The 'Edited' transaction Â recorded to the ac_audit_log related to the update of the report will only occur Â on the first run of Â the report or first Â open Â of the report in edit mode. Â  Â If you edit the report at some point after this first run or first open of the report in edit mode after cutover, these transactions will be recorded as normal to the ac_audit_log table and shown in the Audit Log in the report itself.

Redirecting Oracle B2C Service application data to a UNC path or mapped drive;Answer ID 5249;Is it possible forÃ‚Â Oracle B2C ServiceÃ‚Â AppData to be redirected to a UNC path or mapped drive?;['Answer ID 5142'];   This answer applies to all Oracle B2C ServiceÃ‚Â versions August 2011 and earlier releases.  For versions November 2011 and later, AppData Redirect is not supported. Please see documentation regarding 'Custom Deployment Locations' as an alternate for AppData redirect.;  Â  Since the deployment of the Â Oracle B2C Service Â console is Windows profile-based, by default the application data is placed here:  Â %UserProfile%\AppData\RightNow_Technologies Due to a Microsoft-identified conflict between SQL CE5 and AppData redirection, Â redirecting the AppData of a user's Windows profile to a alternate location Â is not supported. This is beyond the control of Oracle B2C Service. Currently, the only solution is to defer from redirecting AppData and use the local profile instead.   This can be tested Â by disabling the redirect of AppData for the agent's Windows user account, then reinstalling the Oracle B2C Service Â application again.

Logging into multiple workstations at the same time while using the same Staff Account;Answer ID 5267;Is it possible to have an agent log into theÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service console on multiple workstations at the same time?;['Answer ID 10427'];   All versions, Staff Accounts;"  It is Â not possible to log into multiple machines at the same time with the same Staff Account. When a Staff Account logs into Oracle B2C Service, the ""session"" is recorded and a session id is generated for that session. Logging into another machine would generate a new session and a different session id for that Account and ends the prior session. From a compliance standpoint, this is to prevent multiple users from logging into a site and using the same Staff Account at the same time.  If you have questions around what generates a session and how you can prevent inaccurate session billing on your site please review Demystifying Session Usage (PDF).

The Total Login Time column shows the total time all/each Â agents in the group were logged in for sessions that started during the selected date range. You might also be able to create a custom report using the 'chats' table. Â  The 'chats' table has the agent client ID and agent acct_id for the person who completed the chat. Â  Â So Â you could use that, join it to the 'chat_agent_sessions' table and have a count of how many chats each person completed each hour. Â  Â If a person transfers most chats and does not complete them, these numbers will look very low. The 'chat_agent_stats' table also has a field called 'chats_completed'. Â  Â Using this table would be much easier than using the 'chats' table, but data is purged from the table regularly. Â  Â You would only have hourly stats for 30 days before it is thrown out. Â  Â Between 30 and 180 days, you could get daily information very similar to the 'Chat and Cobrowse Activity' (ID 3046) standard report.

There are Â number of optimizations done during the normal Â deployment process such as: Condensing all of the Javascripts into a header file for each page Making one big CSS file out of all the individual CSS files So it is not just copying source code files between ""Development to Staging to Production"", doing these modifications manually Â can break end-user pages in production."

Allowing staff to launch a mailing;Answer ID 5285;How do I allow staff to launch a mailing without giving edit permissions?;['Answer ID 768']; Ã‚Â   Profiles / Outreach;  When launching a mailing, because you are technically making an edit by changing the status, the Add/Edit option must be enabled at the profile level. The reason the Add/Edit and Launch options are separated out Â at the profile level Â is to allow staff to modify content, without giving permissions for them to actually launch the mailing. Â  Â Therefore, Add/Edit can be enabled without Launch permissions, but Add/Edit must be enabled to allow Launch permissions.  For more information, please see Â Profile Permissions.

Campaign emails may have blank merge field content;Answer ID 5289;Why do campaign emails have blank merge field content?;['Answer ID 768'];   Campaigns, Merge Fields, Email Oracle B2C Service  Issue   When processing a campaign email out to an audience determined by an audience segment, some content of the email may be missing.Ã‚Â  More specifically, this may occur if the email uses merge fields within its template to determine content to be included.;"  When creating emails to send out for a Campaign, Oracle B2C Service Â uses queries against the database to select the Â Audience Segment (i.e. the email recipients). Â  In more complex orchestrations, it is possible to create email templates used in these campaigns that incorporate merge fields to insert content relative to each recipient. However, these two activities use different databases. The Audience Segment process queries on Â the replication server. Â  When CX comes to build each unique email to send out, the content merge fields are queried against the Operational database. Â  If there is a significant delay in replication between the two, this can impact the content of the email. Â  An example of this scenario is;  Audience segment chooses customers who registered in last two days exactly. Customer ""JohnD"" registered two days ago at 2:45pm Campaign email is scheduled to send out at 3pm There is an unusual delay in replication between Operations and replication server, 25 mins. Â   The result of this scenario is;  At 3pm, Campaign processing starts. Â  It's looking for customers Â after 3pm two days ago Audience Segment includes JohnD as recipient (as it uses replication server, which is 25 mins behind. It therefore views JohnD's registration as 2:45pm plus 25 mins, i.e. as 3:10pm) When the merge fields within the email template come to be populated, the process queries against Operational database, finds JohnD's registration was 2:45pm which is outside the time, so the merge fields show empty results. Email is still sent to JohnD, but arrives with missing content.  This is an extreme example and depends upon many items being in certain arrangements. Â  However, the key point is that the Audience Segment process uses the replication server, and the campaign email content uses the live Operational database. Â  Replication differences can cause unexpected campaign email results. Note: The use of the replication server by the Audience Segments process is by Â default not changeable."

Automatic Daylight Savings changes for SLA;Answer ID 5316;Do we need to adjust SLAs when daylight savings occurs?;['Answer ID 605'];   Service Level Agreements, SLA, TZ_INTERFACE, Time zone Oracle B2C Service;  Service Level Agreements (SLA) do not need to be updated due to daylight savings. The product handles time changes for timezones where daylight savings time or summer time changes occur. However, the SLAs are not automatically changed for time zone settings (such as GMT-7) as those time zone settings do not take seasonal changes into account. If your location changes time seasonally you must use Â a named timezone which take seasonal changes into account.    Examples of seasonally changing time zone values:     City/Country  TZ_INTERFACE       New York City, USA   Â EST5EDT     Houston, USA   Â CST6CD     Denver, USA   Â MST7MDT     Los Angeles, USA   Â PST8PDT     Munich, Germany   Â Europe/Berlin     Hong Kong, China   Â Asia/Hong_Kong     Perth, Australia   Â Australia/Perth     Sydney, Australia   Â Australia/Sydney     Santiago, Chile   Â America/Santiago     Tel Aviv, Israel   Â Israel       We do not recommend using a GMT+- timezone if you have seasonal changes dues to daylight savings or summer time. If we get a request Â to change from GMT+1 to GMT+2 for a seasonal change we will ask that you change to a named timezone instead. After a change of the TZ_INTERFACE configuration value (a hidden setting) you may have to reapply your SLAs. For more information and how to request a setting change, refer to Answer ID 605: Setting the time zone in Oracle B2C Service. Â This answer also discusses additional considerations to take into account when thinking about a time zone change.

SOAP API security;Answer ID 5318;How is the authentication and user privileges managed for SOAP API?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 5169'];   Connect Web Services for SOAP (CWS) API;  Authentication: You can authenticate with SAML 2.0 (single sign-on) or with account passwords. Authenticating with SAML 2.0 (single sign-on) : SAML-based authentication allows client applications to authenticate--on behalf of agents--using SAML 2.0 tokens to achieve single sign-on capabilities. For additional information about single sign-on with Oracle B2C Service, refer to Â the 'SAML 2.0 Open Login' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products. If you are not using SAML 2.0 authentication when invoking Connect Web Services for SOAP operations, refer to Authentication with account passwords. Authenticating with Account passwords: Â  When the API receives a request a series of access control measures are enforced. First, the site configuration is checked to ensure the API has been enabled at a site level. Second, the user credentials supplied in the request are validated. Third, the profile for the supplied account is checked to ensure the correct profile bit is enabled. Client applications must supply username and password credentials with every request. User privileges: User Â permissions for Â different areas (incidents, answers, contacts Â etc) Â of the product Â are granular and based on the profile level access within Â Oracle B2C Service for a specific user. IP Restriction: Beginning with the May 2013 sites, The configuration setting SEC_PAPI_INTEG_HOSTS_SOAP has been added. This configuration setting defines which hosts are allowed to access the SOAP interface. Valid entries include a comma-separated list of domain names with wildcards, specific IP addresses or IP subnet masks (for example, *.rightnow.com, 1.2.3.4, 10.11.12.0/255.255.255.0). Only users logging in from hosts matching entries in this list are allowed access to the SOAP interface. Default is blank. Â Refer to Â Site Configuration.

If the site uses SSO on customer portal, the SAML_20_SIGN_CERTS needs to be updated with the fingerprint from the certificate (without the colons)   Click Configuration -&gt; Site Configuration -&gt; Configuration Settings.  When the pop up appears, put SAML_20_SIGN_CERTS in the ""key"" field and click search  Verify any previous certificate thumbprints have been documented in the ""Description"" text box  In the ""Value (String)"" text box, highlight any previous certificate thumbprints and delete them. Â  Click on that Value text box to put in the new value.Edit a configuration setting  Select ""Save"" in the ribbon   Test Replace certificates and thumbprints from backups as necessary   Cause: Certificates expire and must be renewed. Please note that while Oracle B2C Service Â can have many certificate entries, only a single valid certificate is used with SAML. Notes: If the signing certificate in the assertion contains chain (intermediate) Â certificates those also must be uploaded into File Manager as well. They can be uploaded under ""Additional Root Certificates"" or ""Additional Intermediate Certificates"". Also please be aware that all uploaded certificates must be valid. If any invalid (such as expired) certificates are encountered during the SSO authentication process the authentication will fail. In a scenario where you are renewing an existing self-signed certificate: if the issuer/subject is the same on the new certificate as on the expiring certificate Â then the public keys must also match. If there are two self-signed certificates for the same subject Â with different public keys in the file manager, the application will not trust either of them. In this case (wherein your identity provider is rekeying the certificate) you should wait to upload the new certificate via the file manager until the time that the IdP starts using it to sign the assertions, and backup and remove the old certificate at that time. If you are unsure how to obtain the signing certificate to begin with, consult the documentation for your identity provider. For example: in Oracle Identity Cloud Service, it can be obtained through that product's Â REST API. Alternatively, your organization may choose to use a certificate purchased from a certificate authority. Consult your IT or security team to understand the impact of the choice of using a self-signed certificate versus a traditional purchased certificate. Since the end-user's browser does not have to trust the certificate, it is common (but not universal) to use a self-signed certificate for SAML authorization.

From the copied report:  Open the report in design view  Right click the hyperlink area and select 'Edit Format'    On the pop up window, select the URL tab You can see the URL link to the standard answer pages which is hardcoded into the 'Use custom URL' box Select the 'Advanced URL definition' In the 'Advanced URL definition' section, uncheck the 'Begin with answers detail URL' Edit the hard coded link to point to the mobile URL link: 'https://&lt;sitename&gt;.custhelp.com/app/mobile/answers/detail/a_id/' Save the report     Now that the new copied report points to the mobile pages, edit the home.php file with the new report id. The FAQ links will now direct you to mobile pages rather than the standard webpages. Notes: If other sections of your main mobile pages contain reports that link to standard webpages, you will also need to edit those reports in the same manner to redirect them to the mobile webpages."

Warming up Dedicated Outbound IP Addresses;Answer ID 5326;Why are the emails using the dedicated outbound IP addresses marked as SUSPECT/SPAM?;['Answer ID 2489'];   Dedicated Outbound IP Addresses;  Â  You will need to warm up your IP Addresses responsibly in order to maintain a Good Reputation for those IP addresses. Â  Â This should be done by slowly injecting mail through those dedicated IPs with a consistent volume, starting with a low volume and gradually increasing the volume over time. It was also strongly recommended that you ensure that SPF and DKIM authentication be configured at the time as well, as this would help with the IP warm up and reputation in general. Please see Â Answer ID 2489: SPF and Sender ID considerations with Oracle B2C Service sites where it explains that in both Sender-ID and SPF, a special TXT resource record associated with the domain name portion of an email address is queried in DNS. Â  Â  Â In the Sender-id and SPF records, you specify your email delivery policy. Â  Â Neither Sender-ID nor SPF mandate what your email delivery policy is, they merely provide the tools to do so. The receiving email servers configured to check for SPF will verify that the sending server is authorized according to the policy defined within the SPF and Sender-ID record for the sending domain name. If your body FROM: (what you see in the email from field) domain is not an Oracle B2C Service assigned email address, your IT department will need to publish the SPF record in your DNS. Â  Â Email messages that fail SPF or Sender-ID validation are much more likely to be regarded as Junk or Spam, and handled accordingly, such as being deleted, or moved to special Junk folders.

Incident Update by Email;Answer ID 5331;How is an incoming email matched to an existing incident?;['Answer ID 1457'];   Techmail Utility Oracle B2C Service, May 2010 and later releases;"  The Â Oracle B2C Service Â application uses a unique tracking string Â within messages Â to identify the correct incident to update by email. Â A reference number in the subject line or content is no longer the primary method of identifying the correct incident. Â The reference number is now a back up method and most likely will not be used. All out going email from Â Oracle B2C Service (Service and Outreach) includes Â this tracking string which Â has details on the specific site the email came from and the object (incident, thread, mailings, contact, etc.) of the source. Â This tracking string is used for bounce handling and incident update. Â  The outgoing email sent to the contact will contain a message ID in a format like the following (Service example). Message-Id: &lt;RNTT.Av8G~wrrDv8S~Rb~Gvce~5Th2NwqyS7~Mrb~.1349793366.xBPEG8YR6iGsN~gleEF_m48!@webmw17.int.rightnowtech.com&gt; When reply is selected on the contact's email client, the email client references the message id in a format like the following in the header of the message sent back to CX. In-Reply-To: &lt;RNTT.Av8G~wrxDv8S~Rb~GvMe~wbxg4gqQi7~Mtr~.1349718784.xBPEG8YR6iGsN~gleEF_m48!@utilmw01.int.rightnowtech.com&gt; When the techmail utility processes the incoming email, the site is identified in the tracking string and by default the message will be rejected if Â the site is different. Â  If Â the incoming email Â is referencing the correct site and contact, then the incident Â identified Â from the tracking string is updated from the incoming email. Â  Example Behavior: A response is added by an agent and sent to the incident contact with a carbon copy to the agent's manager. Â  The manager determines that some internal action should take. The manager removes the reference number from the subject and replies back to CX with the intention of creating a new incident associated to the themselves. Â  Because the tracking string is included in the reply, the techmail utility will filter the message because the manager is not the contact on the incident and the incident was identified from the tracking string. Â  A new incident would not be created. The behavior of incident updates from other contacts Â can be impacted by the EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_MODE configuration setting. Â  Â Please see Â Answer ID 1457: Allowing other contacts to update incidents for more information on this setting and how it works.  Note: Beginning in 17D, the EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED configuration setting as been renamed to EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_MODE. Â  This setting determines the level of security applied when updating an incident by email."

How can we block a customer from accessing chat?;Answer ID 5339;How can we block a customer from accessing chat?;['Answer ID 1131', 'Answer ID 1367', 'Answer ID 245'];   Chat / Configuration;  One option is to create a chat rule to terminate the chat request based on a contact's email address. Â  Â  For this option, please see current documentation for more information Adding a business rule Actions for Chat Rules If the offending user submits multiple email values or you have multiple offending users, you may want to consider creating a contact custom field to designate a contact as 'blocked'.  Â This value can then be used for the chat terminate rule. For more information, see  Â  Adding Custom Fields Another option is to use the system defined 'Disabled Flag' to disable a user. Â  Â This field value Â can also be Â used for the chat terminate rule. See the following for information on this field Â  Disabling a Contact Record Another options is to block the IP address, or a range of IP addresses, by using the SEC_INVALID_ENDUSER_HOSTS setting. Â  Â IP addresses that are defined in this setting will not be allowed to access your end user pages or launch chats. Please note that adding an IP address to this setting will block the user from ALL end user pages on your Oracle B2C Service Â site, not just from chat. For information on this setting, please see Â  Restricting computers or hosts that can access the Oracle B2C Service console and end-user pages One important detail to note: Â  Â If you choose to block a shared IP (for example, some AOL users and many dial-up users are on shared IP addresses) this could potentially lead to blocking more users than you actually intend to restrict, so please be careful that you are only adding IP addresses that are in fact specific to the individuals that are creating nuisance chats.

Explains with regards to transferring a chat to an agent in a different queue;Answer ID 5340;What is the process when transferring chats to agents in another queue?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Chat, Enhanced Console;"  The transfer of a chat is a two part process from the perspective of the agent who is accepting the transferred chat. Please note, in order to transfer a chat, there has to be more than one available chat agent. If there are no other agents available, clicking the 'Transfer' button will trigger the 'No other agents are available' pop-up window. That is, there needs to be logged in agents of the receiving queue that are set to an Available status type. Â  If no agents are logged in and available, Â the queue Â associated with the incoming chat Â will not be visible in the Transfer window. If an agent's max active chats is set to 2 and they are currently engaged in two Â chats, they will still show in the list, but when the chat is transferred to that agent a pop up will show up saying ""Request to 'the agent' is 'Unavailable' choose another agent'. 1. The 'Chat Transfer Invitation' popup appears with 'Accept', Â 'View' and 'Decline' options. Â If an agent wishes to review the conversation done so far, Â he would click 'View'. Â  Â At this point, Â the agent who receives the transfer Â has the opportunity to engage in a private chat with the original agent, so that information can be passed between agents without being visible to the end user. This conversation can be done through the 'Compose' section that has a blue background. 2. The two options on the second chat screen are 'Accept' and 'Decline' and they are placed above the 'Compose' section. Â This is where the new chat agent can accept the chat and engage directly with the end user. For additional information, refer to the 'Transfer a chat to another agent' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products."

Message Undeliverable failure in Audit Log;Answer ID 5355;Why is there a Message Undeliverable failure transaction that is occurring when trying to send an incident response?;['Answer ID 280'];  All versions of Oracle RightNow CX, Incident Responses,Ã‚Â Attachments;" Failed messages Â can occur because of the size of an attachments that is included with a response. Â  Â There is a limit of approximately 8-10MB for any email message sent into or out of the application, but there are other variables that can affect that as well, such as bandwidth, server configuration, connection speeds, firewalls, etc. As a rule of thumb and to avoid these failures, we encourage users that when they need to include a file that is larger than 5-6MB with an incident, that rather than trying to send it to the contact via an email response, instead attach large files to the incident and then direct them to the end user pages and their ""My Account"" page where they can download and view the document(s).

Message templates also let you quickly apply your organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brand across all notifications and emails, including Service email. Note: Â To edit Message Templates, administrators must have the applicable profile permission enabled. If newly enabled, you may also need to add the Message Templates item to the navigation set associated to that profile. The Message Templates editor is available from Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Message Templates &gt; select the interface you wish to edit message for. From the top ribbon, you can select the message/notification group or edit the global template.  Working with the Message Templates editor: The Message Templates editor contains the global template and a set of system-generated messages. You can edit each template using an HTML editor similar to the HTML editors used to create content for mailings, surveys, and answers. Â  Global Template: The global template contains the content that frames the message-specific content in each of your individual messages. You are able to customize a global template for each individual message in each interface, as they are interface-specific. Â Think of the global template as a wrapper for your entire set of notifications and emails. Using the HTML editor, you can standardize the design of your outgoing messages giving them all the same look and feel. For example, you can insert your organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s logo in the header and your contact information in the footer of the global template. When you are ready to deploy your global template, your brand can be applied to a single message or across all of your messages. For more information, see Message Templates in the online documentation Â for your version. To apply or remove the global template to a specific Message Template, toggle the Template button on the ribbon while the Message Template is open for editing. System-generated Messages: The system-generated messages are sent to staff and contacts to support activities and events occurring throughout the system. Using an HTML editor, you can insert links that appear as clickable text and use merge fields to customize each message. The tools that display on the HTML editor are context-sensitive and are the logical tools you would use for the specific message you are customizing.

Desktop Usage Administration;Answer ID 5412;How can we better manage our desktop user sessions?;['Answer ID 8445', 'Answer ID 5462', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle B2C Service, Desktop Usage Administration;"  Organizations can Â better manage their desktop user sessions, which can help lower seat usage for licensing compliance and reduce costs. Â  This new functionality Â is enabled by default and provides two ways for you to manage desktop user sessions and maintain site security:  Force logout of active sessions - Manually log out staff members who are currently logged in. This terminates the staff member's session and closes the application. Any unsaved work will be lost. For more information, refer to ""Force Logout of active sessions"" within the documentation. Using the ""Logged in Staff Accounts"" standard report (Common &gt; Site Administration &gt; Staff Management), you can see which staff members are currently logged in, the date and time they logged in, and how long they have been logged in. You will also see a Force Logout button on the Record group of the ribbon that you can click to manually log out a selected staff account. You can also right-click a staff account in the list and select Force Logout. See Â Force logout of staff account Â for more information on this topic. Automatic logout of inactive sessions - Â  Set up your application for automatic logout of inactive sessions after a specific period of time. For more information, refer to ""Automatic logout of inactive sessions"" within the documentation.  CLIENT_SESSION_EXP - Use this configuration setting to specify the time in one-minute intervals that a session can be inactive before a staff account is automatically logged out. The default value of CLIENT_SESSION_EXP, located at Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; RightNow Users Interface &gt; General &gt; Security, is 15 minutes and the maximum value is 1440 (24 hours). When session management functionality is Â disabled, Â this setting remains an effective way to maintain site security. NOTE: For August 2012 and previous versions the CLIENT_SESSION_EXP configuration setting exists, but functions differently. For instance, the setting specifies the number of minutes the client can remain idle until the user is forced to reenter credentials to continue. Session Timeout field - Use Â this field on the Profiles editor to specify a time (in minutes) other than the time defined in CLIENT_SESSION_EXP that a session can be inactive before a staff account is automatically logged out, or set this field so that staff members with a particular profile are exempt from being automatically logged out. For more information, see Â Console Locked Message.  For additional information, refer to the Â 'Session Management and Login Controls' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Data Import Wizard failure, .csv contains special characters such as apostrophes;Answer ID 5413;Why is theÃ‚Â Data Import Wizard failing?;['Answer ID 134'];   February 2012, Data Import Wizard;"  If a Â comma-separated value (CSV) contact list was created and saved in Microsoft Â Excel as a spreadsheet, Â this process Â can sometimes Â alter Â a special character, such as an apostrophe, in the file. If Excel was the application where the Â CSV file was created, please try creating the CSV file from a text editor (instead of Excel). This will increase the likelihood that the characters will appear correctly in the text editor and save the file to Â CSV format with an extension of .csv Â in a way that will enable the import to be successful. Â  This can also be done in Excel by saving with a .csv extension. Â  Â In any case, the encoding option you use in Excel or another program to create the Â CSV will need to match the encoding you choose for the import. Â  For example, if you are using UTF-8 in Oracle RightNow CX, then please confirm you have chosen Â UTF-8 in the application you are creating the .csv file with. Notes: If you are using the Data Import Wizard, the File Encoding field is the first field on the second page. Each time you perform an import, you will need to specify the correct encoding through this field. According to Answer ID Â 134: Importing or exporting odd characters in .csv files ""CSV handles all of these different characters when it imports or exports in that format. The CSV file uses quotes to identify the beginning and end of a field. When importing, if quotes exist in the body text, then there needs to be an additional set of quotes surrounding that text. In other words, double quotes are necessary so that the import utility does not treat the quoted text as an additional field. This acts as a comment for the quotes so that it is not treated as a new field in the CSV file."""

Read Logging;Answer ID 5421;What is Read Logging?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 134'];   November 2012 and newer releases, Incident Read Logging August 2018 and newer releases, Contact Read Logging;  Read Logging functionality allows you to track every time an incident or contact is viewed in the console.  Â Each time an incident or contact is viewed (aka Ã¢â‚¬Å“readÃ¢â‚¬Â) a new transaction log record will be added to the transactions table. These transactions will not appear in the respective workspace Audit Log by default. To view these audit records, the Ã¢â‚¬ËœShow Read TransactionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attribute will need to be checked for all Incident and/or Contact Workspaces that are used.  Â This Design option appears after the read logging configuration for the instance is set on.   Once the Ã¢â‚¬ËœShow Read TransactionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ design item is checked in the appropriate workspace, when incidents or contacts are viewed, an entry appears on the Audit Log tab.   Note, when the feature is enabled, all new reads are recorded.  Â And, if disabled, new reads are no longer recorded in the transaction table, but any prior transactions remain. If you would like to enable either of these functionalities please submit a service request to Ask Technical Support.

WARNING! Increasing this setting may impact site performance and report performance. Increases to this setting should be done incrementally such as 10,000 at a time to ensure that reports are working and the site is not being impacted. One possible impact of increasing this setting is that larger reports may no longer be able to run. If after you increase this setting agents report site slowness or reports suddenly throwing errors, make sure to lower the setting. Overtime as the database grows, you may need to lower the VRL_HARD limit."

Configuring incident purging on an established site;Answer ID 5461;How do I set purge incidents when my site is several years old?;['Answer ID 10013', 'Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 605'];   The resolution below applies to Oracle B2C Service (OSvC), versions 18A and below, regarding purging incidents.  NOTE  The process described in this answer is not applicable to versions 18B and above.Ã‚Â Starting from 18B release, the configuration functionality was migrated to Data Lifecycle Management framework. SeeÃ‚Â Using Data Lifecycle Policy to purge (or archive)Ã‚Â for more information.;"  Beginning with the 18B release, the incident purge functionality has been moved to the Data Lifecycle Policy in the Browser Agent where customers can view, enable and configure data lifecycle settings.  Â Refer to the user documentation here. When enabling Â incident purging on an established site it is necessary to gradually purge incidents at a rate of approximately 25,000 per day. Â  Therefore it is necessary to estimate how many incidents will be purged and change the configuration daily as incidents are purged by the agedatabase utility. Â  Use the report described in this answer to estimate how many incidents will be purged with a specific setting. Â  Prior to the 18B release, PURGE_DELETE_INCIDENTS represents the number of days after an incident is solved that it is permanently deleted from the database.  Â This configuration is set to 0 by default which is disabled, meaning incidents will never be deleted from the database.  Â This setting can be edited at Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; search by Key. Â The PURGE_DELETE_INCIDENTS configuration is set per interface so a calculation for each interface is required. Note: The purge function permanently deletes incident data. Â  Once an incident is deleted, it cannot be retrieved. For help creating a basic report please refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a basic custom report. 1. Create a standard report with the following columns:  Heading: Date Closed Expression: date_format(incidents.closed,'YYYY-MM-DD') Heading: Purge Days Expression: time_format(date_diff(to_date(date_format(sysdate(),'MM-DD-YYYY'),'MM-DD-YYYY'),incidents.closed),'DD') If you have incidents that are assigned to multiple interfaces you should also add the following column. Heading: Interface Expression: incidents.interface_id Heading: Count Expression: count(*)  2. Sort the Date Closed column descending. 3. Create Â the following Â filter(s):  Name: Closed Expression: incidents.closed Operator: between Value: -60 months relative to -36 months relative (These are example values for purging incidents over 3 years old on a 5 year old site.) If you have incidents that are assigned to multiple interfaces you should also add the following filter. Name: Interfaces Expression: incidents.interface_id Operator: in list  4. Click the Home tab, then Â Options, More options and change the Data Source to ""Report Database"" (also referred to as replication server). 5. Preview the report while adjusting the Closed filter to show the oldest incidents and save the report. Â  Note that there may be multiple rows returned for one closed date. Â  This is due to the way time is calculated during daylight savings time depending on the TZ_INTERFACE setting. For information on this setting, refer to Answer ID 605: Setting the time zone in Oracle B2C Service. 6. Use the report to select a value that will purge approximately 25,000 incidents. Set configuration according to site release and wait for the purging to happen. Â  7. Repeat this process daily until the configuration is set to purge the desired incident age. If you wish to track how many incidents that you have purged you must save the values of this report into a spreadsheet. Â  There is no built in functionality that tracks purged incidents. Cause: The purge configuration setting allows solved incidents to be permanently deleted from the database. Â  Set the value according to your organization's data retention policy and to help reduce the size of your database. Although this report uses the incidents.closed field it is a good enough estimate for purging. Â  Â Incidents may appear on the report that are older than the Â purge days setting. Â  These incidents are Â either Â not set to a Â closed incident status or the closed age Â is less than the purge days setting."

It requires that you input your password to regain access to the console. We do not wish to keep this lock, but cannot work out how to remove it.";"  You can disable the Automatic lock of inactive sessions for all users by editing the CLIENT_SESSION_EXP configuration setting. This configuration setting specifies the number of minutes the user can remain idle until the user is forced to reenter credentials to continue. Setting this configuration setting to 0 disables this feature. However, you may want to exempt only certain users from an automatic lock. You can accomplish this by customizing the automatic lock by profile to override the time set in the CLIENT_SESSION_EXP configuration setting. To exempt automatic logout by profile:  Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. Double-click Profiles under Staff Management. The report opens on the content pane. Select the profile you want to edit and click the Open button on the ribbon. Click the User Settings tab to display the Session Timeout field. (Beginning Â in November 2013, this tab is called Â ""Other"".) Â  To exempt staff members associated with this profile from being subject to an automatic logout, type 0 in this field. Click the Save and Close button on the ribbon.  Important! Even if the value in CLIENT_SESSION_EXP is set to 0, any value other than 0 in the 'Session Timeout' field will be used to automatically Â lock staff members associated with this profile when the time of inactivity has been exceeded. For more information on managing desktop users, refer to Answer ID 5412: Desktop Usage Administration.

Suggestions for mail setup;Answer ID 5468;Are there best practices for setup of incoming email?;['Answer ID 2205'];   All versions. Incoming mail, techmail, POP, SMTP;"  With proper setup, techmail can handle huge volumes of mail with little intervention. Â  Â However improper setup and design of your site can lead to complicated processes which are prone to failure. Here are some general practices for handling incoming mail with the techmail utility: 1. Have customers mail directly into the mailbox that techmail pops.  Techmail can pop hosted mailboxes (with a custhelp.com address) and external mailboxes with your own domain address.  2. If using SMTP forwarding, always forward mail with no changes to the email.  Email should always come into techmail with the ""Reply to"" address of the customer (contact). The full domain should be used for the mailbox: popaccount1@mail&lt;pod&gt;.custhelp.com (in lieu of popaccount1@custhelp.com).  Â Examples include popaccount1@mailph.custhelp.com or popaccount1@mailgb.custhelp.com.  3. Use individual incoming mailboxes for each interface (each brand or language) and if possible each incident queue.  Each interface has a techmail process therefore a greater volume of mail can be handled. Â  Oracle RightNow pop accounts should be enabled for incoming mail on one and only one interface. Â  Mailboxes with the same email address (pop account) can be enabled for outgoing mail on multiple interfaces but can only be enabled for incoming mail on one interface.  4. Always create unique subject lines for each email coming from automated systems such as web forms.  Multiple incidents with the same email address will slow duplicate checking therefore all subject lines should be unique.  5. Always use the original email address for any email coming from automated systems such as web forms.  Set the ""Reply to"" address of the automatically created email to that of the contact associated to the issue. Do not create many automated incidents a day (&gt; 20) Â with the same from address as these incidents will be filtered by loop prevention functions.  6. Do not change the default configurations for email gateway (EGW_*) without careful review.  The default settings are set to ensure your site is resistant to email loops and spam mail.  7. Even if you are not currently using email as a support channel, always collect an email address when creating a new contact. Â   An email address helps define a unique contact and allows proper email handling should your organization decide to use email in the future.  8. When an incident is first created, use rules to assign incidents to incident queues. Â  Â   A simple rule (that is scalable) for this purpose is to select techmail incidents and then set mail from specific mailboxes to specific incident queues. Â  Â Refer to the following answer for more incident rule best practices. Â  Answer ID 2205: Best practices for setting up incident rules ."

Using support channels to satisfy a short response time;Answer ID 5470;Can I use email to meet a 15 minute response requirement?;['Answer ID 331', 'Answer ID 8745', 'Answer ID 1361'];   Incoming E-mail,Ã‚Â techmail utility Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  Although we often think of email as being instantaneous, email messages Â are commonly Â delayed Â as they travel across the Internet sometimes hours or even days. Â  Â Therefore our product calculates Service Level Agreements (SLAs) from the time an email is pulled by techmail and an incident is created or updated. There is no way to calculate an SLA from Â when an email is sent. An email travels across many servers to arrive at its destination and the load and responsiveness of each can affect the travel time. Â  Therefore email simply cannot be relied on to Â be delivered in a set amount of time. Â  To expedite email processing, Â we recommend that you set up Oracle-managed accounts (see Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service), which utilize Â Techmail On-Demand for processing a message near real time. While we still cannot control delays that may occur from customer mail servers to ours, once the email is received, we will turn that into an incident (or update an incident) with a subsequent run of techmail. Because this run is automatically triggered by the incoming message, in some cases, it may Â greatly decrease the wait time as opposed to the normal schedule. We suggest that if you have a hard requirement to respond to a customer in a very short period of time, such as 5 minutes, Â that you do not use email as a support channel. Phone or chat will allow a customer to be in contact with an agent immediately. Â  Â Although the Â Ask a Question page will update an incident immediately, you would have to set Â up screen pops or some other real time customization to be informed of the update. Techmail is the utility that processes incoming e-mails. For more information on this utility, refer to Answer ID 1361: What are techmail considerations I need to know?

Identifying and breaking email loops;Answer ID 5476;How do I identify and break an existing email loop?;['Answer ID 5331', 'Answer ID 5392', 'Answer ID 5475', 'Answer ID 2345', 'Answer ID 2800', 'Answer ID 10338', 'Answer ID 10371'];   Incoming Email Oracle B2C Service (OSvC), All versions;"  Most email loops can be identified by either many duplicate incidents or incidents that have many duplicate threads. Â  The type of loop depends on the auto-responder. Â  If the responder sends enough of the original message to contain the tracking string, then incidents are updated with many threads. Â  If the responder does not send the tracking string then duplicate incidents may be created. Â  Â If a site has one type of loop, the other will usually also exist. Â  For more information on email tracking strings please refer to  Â Answer ID 5331: Incident Update by Email. Â  1. To search for the current loops you need to create two reports. Refer to the following answers for instructions.  Answer ID 5392: Creating a report that counts threads in incidents Answer ID 5475: Creating a report that counts recent incidents with the same subject  2. Inspect the incidents identified by the 2 reports and decide which are appropriate. Â  Â Often times there are multiple appropriate incidents with duplicate subjects and/or incidents with many threads due to processes or external integrations (such as forms that create incidents). 3. Â Gather email addresses from the incidents which appear to be loops. Â  Â  4. Add these addresses temporarily to the Barracuda Spam filter email blacklist to break the loops. Â  Refer to Answer ID 2345: Barracuda Spam filters on hosted Service mailboxes Â for information on logging in to the spam filter Â and configuring the blacklist. 5. Edit or disable the contacts that have invalid email addresses. 6. Wait for a few hours for the all emails created by the loops to be filtered. Remove the active customer addresses from the Barracuda Spam filter blacklist. Â  7. Evaluate your site for the causes of loops and make changes. Cause: There are multiple causes for email loops. Â  Most unhandled loops include rules and configuration settings and usually all go un-noticed due to agent reports that filter the loop incidents.  All loops require an automatic response from CX. Â  Evaluate the business case for sending automatic responses carefully. If loops are a problem find some other functionality to satisfy your business case. When configuring business rules to send auto-responses, take into consideration the case when a message cannot be delivered to its destination. If the message cannot be delivered and the bounced email message does not invalidate the contact, a loop can occur if the business rule that sends the auto-response is hit every time the bounce message updates the incident. For more details, please see Bounced E-mail message handling. Never send more than one autoresponse per incoming email. Â  Add multiple responses Â through rules and only include one ""send response"" action. Â  Disable automatic Contact Emails in Configuration -&gt; Interfaces. In all rules that send auto-responses, move the ""send response"" action Â to a state that is only active once. Â  Ensure that there are catch-all rules so that all incidents follow the path that sends only one response. Chose the correct level for the mailbox Discard Automatic Responses setting. Â  Evaluate the common autoresponders and add a REGEX for common response subjects to the EGW_AR_CONS/MODR/AGGR_BODY_FLTR configuration. There is an automatic anti-loop filter that filters any messages above Â 23 per 12 hour period (EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS per EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION) from the same address. Â  Do not disturb these configuration settings. Â  Ensure that external processes that send email to Â OSvC use the sender's address instead of a single email address. (See Â Configurations EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS and EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION explained Â for more information.)  Answer ID 10371: Error 'Root element is missing' when attempt to send a response on an incident"

What to expect when using * Wildcard searching;Answer ID 5480;What is the result of using the * Wildcard character when searching answers?;['Answer ID 5331', 'Answer ID 5392', 'Answer ID 5475', 'Answer ID 2345', 'Answer ID 2800', 'Answer ID 10338', 'Answer ID 10371'];   Knowledge base (KB), Search, Phrase Stemming;"  When searching KB answers while using the Wildcard character, some results may seem unexpected at first review. The reason for this is that Phrase/Word Stems are also in play and take precedence over the Wildcard. 1. The result of searches including the wildcard is different for searches that use a phrases table from those that don't. e.g. (non-phrases table search) If a wildcard is added to the end of a string when searching contacts, anything that matches the string or is longer than but includes the string will be found. e.g. (phrases table search) When searching answers, which uses the ans_phrases table this will not necessarily be the case. The reason is Phrase/Word Stemming.  Â  2. When answers are being searched. The wildcard brings back the results of answers that contain words or parts of words that do not have a proper word stem, unless the search is smaller than the stem. If the partial word is less than the stem it will find the stem. e.g. ""insu*""(with wildcard) does locate the word stem ""insur"" but ""insura*""(with wildcard) does not. The reason for this is that Word Stems Â are only found Â when a complete prefix or suffix can be removed. e.g. A partial word such as ""insura"" or ""emergen"" doesn't contain either so they do not result in a stem. 3. Stemming applies first, then the Wildcard. In the case of ""insura*""(with wildcard), because it's not a word that contains a suffix or prefix, a Word Stem is not found. This eliminates proper Word Stems and leaves the wildcard searching for results that are in the phrases table but no proper words as those have already been eliminated by Stemming. This leads to very few or zero results which can be misleading, especially when you already know the word ""insurance"" for example has many related answers.  4. Some results that might be found could be without proper punctuation (proper punctuation is necessary for search to recognize real words), misspelled or part of an email address such as ""insurance@companyname.com"" or something like ""insurance-company"" or ""insurance/retirement"". If using the ""insur"" example (insur being a proper word stem), without the wildcard those additional results will not be found. Note:  Â A short document with tips and a guide to wildcard searching answers is attached."

Restricting answers that are visible by URL;Answer ID 5481;How did Google index my answers that should not be available fromÃ‚Â that interface?;['Answer ID 208', 'Answer ID 1838', 'Answer ID 1112', 'Answer ID 4575'];   All versions using Customer Portal when restrictingÃ‚Â answer end user page availability by product, category, or language.;"  To restrict answers from being indexed by a search engine (available by URL) you should create an answer access level that is not available on that interface. 1. Create a new access level that restricts visibility to the interface. Answers that are not restricted by access level or status are visible on the end user pages. Â  Â Answers restricted by product, category or language will not be available in searches or reports but will be visible on all interfaces by the answer detail URL (&lt;sitename&gt;/app/answers/detail/a_id/####).  For information on creating answer access levels, refer to Answer ID 208: Specifying answer access levels to display on the end-user pages. If you wish to restrict answers to your agents (or by SLA) refer to Answer ID 1838: Setting up privileged access. For information on how product and category visibility affects answers, refer to Answer ID 1112: Publishing an answer to the end-user pages.  2. Assign the new access level to the answers that should not be indexed.  Note that it may be helpful to create a report that lists answers by Product or Category to make bulk editing of answers simpler. You can create a report that includes Product Hierarchy or Category Hierarchy (but not both) and list the answers that should be assigned the new access level. Â  Add the answers.access_id field to show the access level in the report. Note that the answers.access_id field is not available Â for edits with the Inline Editing functionality.  3. Test the answer availability with the answer detail URL Â (&lt;interface&gt;.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/##). 4. Request that the pages be removed from the search engine's index. Â  Refer to Answer ID 4575: Google indexed our site and we want it removed Â for more information. Cause: Answers are restricted in searches on the end user pages by a report filter called ""special settings"". Â  This report filter is responsible for filtering answers by product, category and language. Â  It is often assumed that if the end user page reports Â do not return an answer that the answer is not visible on the interface. Â  However, the availability of an answer using the answers/detail page is set only by the answer status and access level. Â  Search engines often ""guess"" the URL of an answer and will include the URL in search results. Â  Therefore access levels or privileged access Â should be used to control visibility of answers on a multiple interface/brand site. Refer to the following table for more information on answer visibility:        Visible in Searches      Visible by URL      Status      Access level      Product, Category and/or Language       No  No  Not Public  Any  Any     No  No (may require login)  Public  Not visible to interface  Any     No  Yes  Public  Visible to interface  Not visible to interface     Yes  Yes  Public  Visible to interface  Visible to interface     Notes: ""Visible in searches"" is from an end user report using the special settings filter. Â  ""Visible by URL"" is from the URL &lt;interface&gt;.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/##"

Test Site Details;Answer ID 5483;What are the details for aÃ‚Â Test Site?;['Answer ID 11002', 'Answer ID 1764', 'Answer ID 5129', 'Answer ID 10925', 'Answer ID 5755', 'Answer ID 6092'];   Test Sites, All versions;"  The Oracle B2C Service (Oracle RightNow/RNOW) product provides the option to create a copy of your Oracle B2C Service Â production site to Â provide an Â environment for Â testing new changes prior to rolling out changes in the production environment. The Oracle Â Service Cloud test site Â may also be used as a training site for new or existing staff members. Test sites are included with your license. How many test sites are allowed are determined by your license. You can see how many test sites you are allowed in the Configuration Assistant or you can ask your sales account manager. Â  Test sites are not intended to be where the initial site configuration occurs. Â  There is no feature or automation option to transfer test site configuration to the production site Â or to change a test site into a production site. Therefore, if you are new to Oracle B2C Service, best practices suggests that the initial configuration of your site be completed on the Â production site. Once the production site is complete and running, then create your test site. Â  Please note: Â  If you are using the Browser User Interface you can use the Element Manager as a tool to move configurations across sites. Â  Please see answer: Â https://cx.rightnow.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/11002 and also in the documentation https://documentation.custhelp.com/euf/assets/devdocs/cloud19d/olh/CoreFeatures/topicrefs/c_Element_Manager_link.html as limitations will apply Test Site naming: Test sites use a standard naming convention of: (production site name)__tst(number of test site). For example: productionsitename__tst1 productionsitename__tst2 Best practices recommends to use the standard naming convention and to not change the name of the test site to avoid unpredictable negative impact. If your business requirements need a different name for staff, an alternative option is to change the display name of the interface. For more details about changing the display name, please see Â Answer 1764: Changing the interface name displayed. Please note: This option will be lost on test site re-create/refresh and will need completed each time the site is re-created/refreshed. Â  Test Sites do Â not include: Customization support (Oracle Â Service Cloud) will not provide technical or update services to support or maintain customer-specific customization(s) previously written by Oracle Consulting, or the customer.  Customizations are not guaranteed to be copied from the production site to the test site regardless of clone type. Â  New customizations will not be written by Oracle Consulting. Documented API frameworks will be supported to validate that they are working as expected, but customizations written using the API frameworks for a Test Site are not supported. Please note that any customizations on the old test site will be destroyed and will not carry over when the new test site is created. Please see Answer ID 5129: Customizations on refreshed test sites and update sites Â for more information regarding Test Site customizations. There is no automated option to move changes and configuration from the test site to the production site. You should manually keep track of your changes in order to manually implement them on the production site. Â  General steps that a test site re-create goes thru: Test sites are refreshed/re-created in the Configuration Assistant self-service tool at your convenience. If you need access to the Configuration Assistant, please submit a service request to the Oracle B2C Service support team. Â  The standard steps for a test site refresh/re-create completed in the Configuration Assistant are below. 1 - Delete the existing test site. During this time, you will not see a test site in the Configuration Assistant. 2 - Assigned to the cloning queue. 3 - Clone the existing production site to the new test site. As the site clones, it will appear in the Configuration Assistant. However, it will not be accessible until the clone is completed. Â  4 - If the ""re-create and upgrade"" option was selected in the Configuration Assistant, then the new test site is upgraded/updated to the latest version of the product that is available for your site. Â  For information on updating a test site, refer to Â Answer 10925: Updating Oracle B2C Service Test Site Version. * Once the new test site is completed, you will need to Â enable the utilities, mailboxes, reconnect to Intelligent Advisor, etc. Â in the Configuration Assistant. These items are not automatically enabled. Â  Â    Scheduling a test site: Â  - You can schedule your test site refresh/re-create and upgrade. - Please understand that the schedule is when the test site re-create process will begin, not Â when it will be completed. Â  - The schedule is in Pacific Time, not your local time. Â  - If you want the test site re-create process to begin as soon as possible, leave the option blank. Â    Notes: - The test site refresh/re-create task is not instantaneous. It can take several hours to several days to complete. We have no insight into the time it will take. Â  - Test sites are not automatically refreshed/re-created when your production site is upgraded/updated. - Configuration, Customizations, and Implementation on test sites are Â not automatically transferred from the test site to the production site. You will need to manually make the changes on the production site. Â  - Â You will lose any custom vhosts you have applied to test sites when they are refreshed. This is because the cloning process reassociates the interface by its original name in DNS, which is on our *.custhelp.com domain and certificate. If you attempt to access using the custom name after a refresh, you may see certificate or SSL errors. The solution at this time is to submit a service request to technical support and we can manually reapply the custom name for you. Frequent refresh requests will be directed to Oracle Consulting. When submitting a ticket, it is helpful to provide the certificate and as much information as possible. - If you are new to using Oracle B2C Service and have just created the production site, the initial configuration should be completed on the production site before creating the test site. This is only for brand new production sites. There is no benefit to creating the test site(s) at the same time the production site is created. Test sites cannot be converted into a Â production site. Â  - The cloning process does not impact the production site. However, if you need to re-create/refresh or create two or more test sites, it is recommended to do one at a time. Having two or more clones running at the same time off the same production site can cause the cloning processes to slow down significantly. Â  Clone types: Full - Â Full clone of the production site. Â  Sparse - Includes the last 1000 records of the Contacts and Incidents tables. Â  Discreet or Sparser clone - Includes custom objects. Does not include the Contacts or Incidents table data. - Standard functionality only can clone from production to test site. There are no options to clone from test site to test site or from test site to production site. Â  - It is not possible to select individual tables and/or modules to be cloned or not cloned. The clone copies all tables/modules Â by default. For customizations, please see above. Â  Â  Test site refresh/re-create options: Test site re-create: This option will follow the steps 1-3 above. As the new test site is created by cloning the production site, the new test site will be on the same product version as the production site. (Example: Production site on 18C - New Test site will be on 18C). Test site re-create and update: This option will follow the steps 1-4 above. The new test site will be upgraded/updated to the latest product version available for your site. Please note, there is no option to select a specific product version. (Example: Production site on 18C - New Test site will be on latest version of product available). Â  * Please do not select the ""re-create and upgrade"" option if your your production site is already on the latest version of the product. Â  Times when a Test Site cannot be created/re-created/refreshed: There are times when test site cannot be created/re-created or refreshed due to changes being made to the database. When the production database is being modified, it is not possible to clone/copy the database while the modifications are being completed. A few examples are: Custom Object deployment Custom Field deployment/creation Interface Create and/or Rename Update/Upgrade (Note: post-update/upgrade processes continue to run after cutover) Site migration to a new pod  For more information on test sites, refer to the following: Answer ID 5755: Popular Answers About Refreshing a Test Site.

Message Base search functionality in newer release;Answer ID 5498;The Message Base search does not function correctly unless you enter exact message base name in 'Key' field.;['Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   August 2012 and newer releases;"  When using the 'Key' field in the Message Base search, you need to type the specific name of the message base in the search field. However, you can just enter the first few letters and append either the percentage sign (%) or an asterisk (*) to serve as a wildcard. All message bases that begin with the letters you type will be returned. Path: Â  Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Message Bases  -For example, when searching for 'chat' in the 'Key' field of the message base, no results are returned. However, when searching for 'chat%' or 'chat*' (without single quotes) in the 'Key' field, results are returned. When using the 'Text' field in the Message Base search, you need to type the message base default text (or a portion of the default text) to return message bases with a value that matches the text you type.  -For example, when searching for 'chat' in the 'Text' field, results are returned. When searching for 'ASSUME_SOLVED_HTML' in the 'Text' field, no results are returned. This is working as designed because 'ASSUME_SOLVED_HTML' is not the default text of the message base, it is part of the name of the message base.  When using the 'Custom Text' field in the Message Base search, you need to type message base default text (or a portion of the default text) to return message bases with a value that matches the text you type.  -For example, when searching for 'Please reply to this email' in the Custom Text field, results are returned. This is working as designed because this is the customized text of the ASSUME_SOLVED_HTML_MSG message base, not the default text of the message base.

Not receiving 'Sign Out' prompt when exiting console;Answer ID 5501;When exiting our Oracle B2C Service console, I do not receive a prompt to sign out of my session. What causes this?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Any Windows version where multiple monitors are used Agents logged into your instance of Oracle B2C Service;  By default when stretching your Windows desktop across multiple monitors the Task Bar remains on your primary display. There are multiple third-party applications available that offer the functionality of expanding the Windows Task Bar across secondary displays as well. When open, the Oracle B2C Service console maintains an icon in your Windows system tray that will allow you to perform the following tasks:  New Console Notifications Sign Out  A behavior has been identified where using one of these third-party desktop expansion applications will cause Â this Task Bar icon to no longer function. Additionally it will suppress the Oracle B2C Service 'Sign Out' prompt when exiting the application. The workaround in this case is to disable any third-party Windows desktop expansion software, as they are incompatible with Oracle B2C Service.

CLIENT_SESSION_EXP limit reached, agent still logged in;Answer ID 5507;Why are agents still shown as logged in after the limit set with CLIENT_SESSION_EXP has been reached?;['Answer ID 5462', 'Answer ID 5412'];   Configuration Setting, Agent Console, Logout/Login Oracle B2C Service;"  If the computer that an agent is using goes into ""sleep"" mode or otherwise loses it's network connection before the agent logs out (or the session expires), the agent will still show as being logged in. Once the expiration point is passed, the agent's session will end. If the computer was in sleep mode or the connection was lost, the session will not end until the computer is powered back up, the console is loaded, and a new session created.  CLIENT_SESSION_EXP Specifies the number of minutes the client can remain idle until the user is forced to reenter credentials to continue. Setting this value to 0 disables this feature. Maximum is 1440 (24 hours). Default is 15.

While the default interface on a CX site handles the initial creation for the new Contact, and generates the initial outbound email, the email generated from the button on the portal needs to be sent from the ""client"" interface on the site (i.e. the interface for the portal). Using an Admin or Super-user login, if you log in to the ""client"" console on the site and review the Mailboxes under Site Configuration, you will see that you will need to set mailboxes to be configured and/or activated. Â  Â Once active, the portal button will have a mailbox to send though, and the contact will receive an email to complete the account setup. This is likely to be encountered on a test-site clone, as it is the normal process by Cloud Operations that site clones have mailboxes deactivated on clone creation."

External Suppression List;Answer ID 5529;What is an External Suppression list and howÃ‚Â can we add a list?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Mailings, Surveys, External Suppression list, Audience Oracle B2C Service;"  An external suppression list is available in Oracle RightNow Outreach and Feedback to define a list of email addresses that are excluded from mailings and surveys. When a mailing or survey is sent or launched, the audience is automatically checked against the external suppression list and email is not sent to contacts with an email address on the list. This can help ensure that certain addresses are consistently excluded from marketing and survey communications even if those contacts have not explicitly opted out. To create or edit an external suppression list:   Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane.   Expand Outreach folder &gt; double-click External Suppression List. The editor displays on the content pane.   To append a list of email addresses to the external suppression list, click the Append to List button on the ribbon.   To add an individual email address to the external suppression list, type the email address in the Add to the External Suppression List field at the bottom of the editor. Click the add button to the right of the field.  To Â replace Â the existing Â external suppression list with a different list, click the Replace Â List button on the ribbon. To delete individual email addresses in the external suppression list, search for the addresses you want to delete. Select the check box next to each address you want to delete. Click the Delete button on the ribbon. To delete all email addresses in the external suppression list, click the Delete All button on the ribbon.   Note: The external suppression list is honored by default. However, you can configure individual mailings and surveys to ignore the list and send to all audience members.

Proof messages for surveys and mailings are not sent/delivered;Answer ID 5533;How can I determine if a proof message was sent/delivered for a survey or mailing?;['Answer ID 331'];   Proof, Mailing, Surveys Outreach and Feedback, Oracle B2C Service;"   Â  The first step is to make sure the Survey Proof message type is enabled.  In November 2012 and newer, with Message Templates enabled, the 'Survey Proof' message can be enabled/disabled from the Message Templates configuration area (Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Message Templates). In November 2011 through August 2012, submit a service request to Technical Support via the Ask Support form describing the issue. They can confirm at the database level if this message type is enabled or not.   Â  Next, confirm Â there is Â an Outreach Mailbox configured for the interface.  Under Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes &gt; Outreach Mailboxes, confirm that Outgoing Email And Default checkboxes are selected. For more information on setting up an Outreach mailbox, refer to Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service.   Â  It is often the case that the message has been sent but it was blocked or filtered.  Make sure to check the junk / spam folders for the proof message. You can test this by trying to send the proof to an alternative email address. If the proof gets delivered then the problem is likely an issue with the Spam filter for your email. Check with your IT administrator to ensure that emails from your site's domain are not being filtered.   Â  The next step is to verify whether or not the message was handed off correctly at the SMTP level. Â  Â   For assistance investigating this, submit a service to Ask Technical Support. Include the email address(es) affected and the date/time the proof(s) were sent. Â  Â We would be happy to review the outgoing mail logs to confirm whether the message was delivered to your mail server or if a delivery error occurred. Â  Â  If the message was handed off successfully, we can provide you with a unique message ID that you can share with your mail administrator to confirm whether it is being routed correctly. Â  Â   "

Data Restore Process;Answer ID 5536;We haveÃ‚Â inadvertently deleted data from our site. CanÃ‚Â it be restored?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Process for Data Restore Requests Oracle B2C Service;"  The Oracle B2C Service product runs on a transactional production database, and is Â not a datawarehouse. Therefore, deleted records are not easily restored as there is no automated option built into the product to ""undo"" delete actions. In order to Â re-insert the deleted records back into the database exactly as they were before, custom scripts need to be created. The custom scripts are required Â to alter the database tables to reinsert the record data that was deleted, Â such as, Â incident reference numbers, threads, assigned info, product/category, time stamps, etc., Â in addition to all the data found in all the associated tables. Â This is not an easy task and can take months to complete. For this reason, this is not a task that can be handled by the Oracle B2C Service Technical Support team. Â  To restore the deleted records back into your site exactly as they were, you will need to engage the Oracle Consulting Services Team to create all the custom scripts needed to reinsert Â the data back into the database as it was before the delete action. This Â is a very pricey undertaking that can cost 10s of the thousands of dollars. Â If you want us to go to consulting and let them know you are willing to pay whatever the fee is, we can hand this over to consulting. The Restore Site option: The Oracle B2C Service Technical Support team can create a restore site. A restore site is created from a daily backup taken of your site. It Â is a temporary site that is available for 30 days. You can use the restore site to copy/reference the deleted data. There is no additional cost or fee to create the restore site. Â  You will need to consider the date/time that the data was deleted in order to provide the date of the backup you wish to use. For example, if the records were deleted on October 2nd, you need the October 1st Â backup. Â  NOTE: The backups are run every 24 hrs on your site. If the deleted Â data was created after the backup run, and deleted before the next backup is created, this data is not recoverable. Â  Typically, customers choose to simply copy the records from a restore site Â into new records on the production site and associate them manually with the other records because of the high fee to restore the database back with all table insertions exactly as they were when the items were deleted. For example, re-create the deleted incident and manually associate it to the contact record. Â  Please understand that Oracle B2C Service Technical Support cannot assist you with retrieving, moving, copying, or any data management tasks. Â  IMPORTANT NOTES: Â  File attachements are not included in a restore site. If you need specific file attachments, please include a list with your request. Â  It is suggested that you carefully review who has the ability to delete items from your database as you do not want to accidentally delete items that you need. Some customers like to mark them to review for deletion before they delete them by using a custom object or field that marks the record and then it can be reviewed by someone else who can then mark the record for deletion and then only delete those records. Be sure to consider cascading deletes. For example: if a contact is deleted, all incidents, opportunities, etc. Â associated with that contact are deleted.  Â If an organization is deleted, all contacts, Â incidents, etc. Â associated with that organization are deleted."

However, you can improve incident searching by using complex expressions. When searching with complex expressions, by default, the terms are associated using an ""OR"" connection. This in essence makes the search terms optional. In order to make a specific term required there needs to be a ""+"" added before the term. For example, if your search requires both ""product"" and ""category"", the complex expression for searching would be written ""+product +category"".

Prompted to save changes, when no changes have been made;Answer ID 5555;Why am I being prompted to Save when closing a record I have not made any changes to?;['Answer ID 2673'];   Workspaces  Issue   Our agents sometimes open a record and then close it without making any changes. However, they still receive a prompt to save their changes:;  The cause for this behavior is due to a change being made to the record. If you have opened a record such as an incident, contact or answer then immediately close the record and are prompted to save, this can be due to one of the following reasons. 1. Workspace Rules The workspace being used by your staff account to load the record may contain a rule to change the value of a field on the workspace under certain conditions such as when the record is loaded. 2. HTML Tidy - within answer workspace If you experience this behavior with answers and have ruled out workspace rules, it is possible that the Tidy utility may be repairing the source code of the answer content. For more information regarding Tidy, please see Â Modifications to the HTML source of documents. 3. Account Signatures with Default Response Thread - within incident workspace Another option is that the agent has an Email Signature associated with their account. In the standard incident workspace, the Response thread opens by default when editing an incident. Â  Where the staff account has a signature, that value is automatically added within that Response thread. Â This is seen as making a change. Â  As a result, Â if the agent then tries to close the incident, they will be prompted to save that change. 4. Incident has an uncommitted response. If an incident response thread is saved without being committed/sent then later, if the incident is opened and closed without any changes it will prompt asking to save changes. 5. Agent assigned to solved incident is transferred to a different group. Incidents are assigned the group id the agent is assigned to, but if the agent is transferred to a different group all solved incidents remain in the old group the agent was assigned to. When the incident is later opened and closed without changes it will ask to save due to the new group the agent is now part of.

However the rules are fully visible in 'View Active' mode.;" If you look at the rule logs and can see that the some rule changes were made recently, there is a good chance that the rules have not saved successfully and are stuck. The rules will not be editable as they are locked in editing mode and the 'edit' screen will appear blank for all users who try to edit the rules.

If the SLA is tied directly to the contact record, you need to pass in enough information to identify the contact. That can be ID OR Name (full name) OR both. If the SLA is tied directly to the organization record, you need to passin enough to identify the contact (like above) OR the Org. To uniquely identify the Org, you can use ID OR Name OR both. You can pass in all the data if you want (just ID, ID + Name, Org + Contact, etc).  If you pass in contact identifiers and organization identifiers, the contact must belong to the organization you identify; otherwise, and error will be thrown.  If a contact does NOT have and Org., it has to have an SLA instance to get access to answers with an access level that the SLA gives them access to.

To Determine Your Internet Protocol (IP) Address;Answer ID 5569;What is an IP address and how do I determine my computer's IP address?;['Answer ID 5318'];  Internet Protocol (IP) Address;" To determine your IP, visit http://cx.rightnow.com/app/utils/whatsmyip As defined by whatismyipaddress.com - ""Every device connected to the public Internet is assigned a unique number known as an Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses consist of four numbers separated by periods (also called a 'dotted-quad') and look something like 127.0.0.1. Since these numbers are usually assigned to Internet service providers within region-based blocks, an IP address can often be used to identify the region or country from which a computer is connecting to the Internet. An IP address can sometimes be used to show the user's general location. Because the numbers may be tedious to deal with, an IP address may also be assigned to a Host name, which is sometimes easier to remember. Hostnames may be looked up to find IP addresses, and vice-versa. At one time ISPs issued one IP address to each user. These are called static IP addresses. Because there is a limited number of IP addresses and with increased usage of the Internet ISPs now issue IP addresses in a dynamic fashion out of a pool of IP addresses (Using DHCP). These are referred to as dynamic IP addresses. This also limits the ability of the user to host websites, mail servers, ftp servers, etc. In addition to users connecting to the Internet, with virtual hosting, a single machine can act like multiple machines (with multiple domain names and IP addresses)."""

Storing and manipulating money (decimal) values in a custom field;Answer ID 5570;How can we store and use money variables in a custom field?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Custom Fields, Data Types Oracle B2C Service;  To store money data which can use decimal values, you Â have to Â select Â text data-type for that specific Â custom field. Now when using these values in report and manipulating them with math functions, they need to be converted to number type first. The c$custom_field should have at least two digits after the decimal point. Â  Â This can be done Â using a Â formula as Â below within reports:  to_number(incidents.c$custom_field) + to_number(substr(incidents.c$custom_field, instr(incidents.c$custom_field, '.') + 1))/100  Where c$custom_field for incidents table Â holds the money data (up to two decimals) with type text. Use the following formula to handle any number of digits after the decimal point.  to_number(incidents.c$custom_field) + to_number(substr(incidents.c$custom_field, instr(incidents.c$custom_field, '.') + 1))/power(10, length(substr(incidents.c$custom_field, instr(incidents.c$custom_field, '.') + 1)))  For additional information, refer to the 'Functions' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

FAQ's for Mobile Agent App / Tap;Answer ID 5575;What are some Frequently Asked Questions for Mobile Agent App / Tap in Oracle RightNow CX?;['Answer ID 9573'];   Oracle Human Capital Management Cloud (Oracle HCM Cloud) Also known as Mobile Agent App / Oracle Tap  NOTE  Ã‚Â Oracle B2C Service Mobile Agent App (TAP) is deprecated as of May 2017;"  Below are a few common questions regarding the Mobile Agent App:  What is the Mobile Agent App?  The Mobile Agent App allows you to manage incidents, tasks and contacts on the go using your Apple iPad or iPhone device, the Oracle Tap application, and your Oracle RightNow CX Cloud Service credentials.   Where can I download Tap?  Using your iPad or iPhone, search the App Store for Oracle Tap.   What is the Â Oracle B2C Service server URL I need to enter into Tap?  After the Mobile Agent App is enabled for your site, you can enter the following server URL pattern into Tap - https://&lt;sitename&gt;/cgi-bin/&lt;interface name&gt;.cfg/php/tap/v1   Can I use Tap and Oracle B2C Service on an iPhone or Android device?  iPhones can be used with Â November 2013 and newer releases. Android devices cannot be used.   Can I customize any of the reports or workspaces?  Very limited customization is offered for reports. Â      You can modify the values used to filter by the last updated date in the various incident lists Â by searching for the configuration settings MOBILITY* on the CX console. You can also modify many of the labels used on the client. Please refer to the attachments section for information on the CustomizableLabels13-2.xls reference guide. You can create customized workspaces and set them on a per profile basis. Custom mobile workspaces can also include custom objects and custom fields.   Can I search for other incidents, contacts or organizations?  Located on the main menu, the search function makes it easy to locate a specific contact, organization, staff member or incident.   Why am I getting a login error?  Following are some common errors and areas of the URL to check to make sure they are specified correctly. Authentication Failure: forbidden   Make sure you are using https   Check to make sure the .cfg section of the URL is correct   Authentication Failure: Invalid authentication URL  Check the full URL - Make sure the &lt;sitename&gt;, &lt;interface_name&gt;, and php/tap/v1 is all correctly specified.  Authentication Failure: not found  Incorrect characters after &lt;sitename&gt; Remember there is no trailing / after/v1, make sure there is no space after the URL, etc  Authentication Failure: internal server error  Incorrect characters after /cgi-bin/  Server Unreachable   This typically means the client cannot find the http server. You may have entered the wrong host/port or you may have lost your Internet (or VPN) connection. If you want to use the client in Offline mode, turn on the iPad in Airplane Mode.     Attachments:  Customizable labels  Please find attached ""CustomizableLabels 13-2.xls"", a list of the customizable labels used in the Mobile Agent App and the Keys for the Oracle B2C Service Administrator to search the Site Configuration &gt; Message Bases if they want to modify the labels.  Mobile incident and contact list report  Please find attached ""incidentsListview100125.xml"", an Oracle B2C Service report that you can import into your system to simulate the list of incidents that will be available to users on their iPads after they first login (incidents where status_type != solved and last updated date is within the last 30 days.). You can import the report as follows: Reports Explorer &gt; New Report &gt; Import Report Definition. The purpose of the report is two-fold. The report is designed to help you identify the number of incidents that will be listed. We recommend keeping the list at a manageable number (less than 1000 is a good start). If there are too many incidents, the client will be slow. If you find that there are too many incidents, adjust the last updated time to a smaller number. Once you are satisfied, you can adjust the value that will be used by the Mobile Agent App by modifying the configuration setting, MOBILITY_INCIDENTS_DAYS_LIMIT."

Email thread is added to incident with reduced or without content;Answer ID 5592;Why do I get occasional blank threads when the customer updates the incident by email?;['Answer ID 2762'];  All versions.Ã‚Â  Techmail, email;" 1. To verify the cause of a blank thread you have to review the original email as it arrives. Â  Enable the EGW_SAVE_ORIG_MESSAGE configuration to save a copy of emails that create incidents. Â  Refer to Answer ID 2762: Maintaining copies of incoming email for incident creation Â for more information. Note that an email that updates an incident Â may not be saved. 2. Inspect the email message in a text editor that allows Linux end of lines such as NotePad++ or TextPad. Â  Note that Microsoft Notepad will not view the email correctly. The body is the section after the header and will be separated by blank lines somewhere after text like ""Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=abcdefghijklmnop"". Inspect the message to verify the Â format follows the following requirements: Â   All sections contained in the root (such as text, html or multipart mixed) must contain Â a full equivalent copy of the message. Â  Note that there will be differences in the messages as html text also contains tags for formatting and multipart sections may contain multiple nested sections. All message parts must be separated by the boundaries in the current message. Â  If there are multiple messages contained in the email (such as a forward or a reply) Â there may be multiple boundary separators. All boundary separators from previous messages should be nested inside the boundary separators of the current message. 3. Add the missing part of the email to a customer entry and work with the sender of the message to eliminate the cause of the format issue. Example message: From: Â  Â Some Sender &lt;customer@gmail.com&gt; To: Some Receiver &lt;support@mbox.custhelp.com&gt; Subject: Formatted text mail MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=abcdefghijklmnop preamble - Text here is ignored. --abcdefghijklmnop Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""utf-8"" ...plain text version of message goes here... --abcdefghijklmnop Content-Type: text/html; charset=""utf-8"" ...html version of same message goes here... --abcdefghijklmnop  Content-Type: image/jpeg; name=""fishtacos.jpg"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""fishtacos.jpg"" /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAgAAZABkAAD/7AARRHVja3kAAQAEAAAAPAAA/+4ADkFkb2JlAGTAAAAA Af/bAIQABgQEBAUEBgUFBgkGBQYJCwgGBggLDAoKCwoKDBAMDAwMDAwQDA4PEA8ODBMTFBQT AeLAAPFgAHiwADxYAB4sAA8WAAeLAAPFgAWn9mAB3wd0AH//2Q== --abcdefghijklmnop"

Information on different database types used for reporting;Answer ID 5609;What are the purposes of the different database types?;['Answer ID 2817'];   Analytics Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  Oracle B2C Service provides two types of databases for reporting. Each has a different purpose.  The Operational Database, also called the RightNow CX database, is the live production database recording all interactions processed from customers, agents, other employees, etc., in real-time. When RightNow Analytics points to this database, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reporting on live, real-time production data. The Operational Database is a transactional database. Transactional databases are designed to process individual transactions quickly and efficiently. This design allows you to interact with your customers quickly when they contact you, provide them fast answers, and to process their related interaction records quickly. The Operation database Â has a max scan size of Â 2,000,000 rows for reporting.     The Report Database (also referred to as the replication server) is a replicated non-live copy of the Operational Database. It shifts the processing of some RightNow Analytics reports off the Operational Database so they run faster and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t impact performance of the live production system. Even though the replication server is a replication of the Operational Database, it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t used to process transactions as the Operational Database is. Rather, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s specifically reserved to perform processing-intensive activities that shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be performed on the Operational Database. The replication server is constantly being updated by the Operational Database. Â For more information, refer to Answer ID 2817: Reporting data seems incorrect or behind. The Report database Â has a max scan size of Â 5,000,000 rows for reporting.   Note:    The replication server is a copy which is constantly being updated from the operational database. If the replication server falls behind in syncing to the production server, then updates to reports will not show immediately. Â  In most cases, your replication connection will be up to date. However, there may be times when the replication server falls behind and replication may be Â several days Â old. This is normal &amp; expected behavior."

Best practices for table joins in Analytics;Answer ID 5612;What are some best practices for table joins when creating reports in CX Analytics?;['Answer ID 4287'];   Analytics, CX Oracle B2C Service (OSvC);  Table joins should be configured to return the smallest data set possible. The smaller the data set Oracle B2C Service Analytics analyzes to process a report, the faster the report will run. The following best practices provide guidelines about how to achieve this, and how to avoid typical cases where join configurations can result in unnecessarily large data sets. A sound understanding of relational databases and SQL can benefit here.  a) Only join to tables needed for the report. For various reasons, sometimes report configurations include joins to tables that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually used in the report. This should be avoided. When possible, eliminate joins and references to tables not used in the report. Â  Sometimes there is a valid reason why a report references columns from tables not used in the report. Keep in mind this will increase report processing time, and there may be ways to avoid doing this. For example, if you need to filter out rows in the parent table that do not have rows in another table, consider adding a NOT NULL filter on the join field in the parent table. Â  Sometimes extraneous joins exist because they were inherited from the definition of a report that was copied to build a new report. Make sure that when you re-use one report to build another, that you review the report configuration and eliminate tables, joins, columns, etc. that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t required for the newer report. b) Use as few tables as possible. Design reports to require the fewest number of tables possible. The fewer tables required for a report, the fewer joins will be needed. This will reduce the number of rows to be analyzed to generate the report, and decrease the related processing required, which contributes to faster report processing. This objective must be balanced however with the insights the report must provide and related filtering needs. c) Avoid joining large tables that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t directly related to each other. Sometimes performance suffers when attempting to join data from very large tables that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t directly related to each other (i.e. through a common key). If you join such tables together, add as many filters as possible to limit the result set. An example is joining the Transactions and Inc_Performance tables in the same report via the Incident record. This will create a very large dataset as the number of rows for a given incident will be equal to the number of transactions multiplied by the number of Inc_Performance records. If such joins are required, make sure it is absolutely necessary. To improve performance, consider adding a filter that provides one or more additional joins between the two tables. An example is adding a filter joining transactions.created to inc_performance.time_start. d) Configure one-to-many joins properly. If the join between tables is a one-to-many join, use the table with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“oneÃ¢â‚¬Â record as the first table, and then join the table with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“manyÃ¢â‚¬Â records to it. e) Configure one-to-one joins properly. If the join between tables is a one-to-one join, use the table with the fewer records (based on the filtering you intend to do) as the first table and the table with the more records as the second table. f) Use inner joins rather than outer joins when possible. Inner joins return less data than outer joins. When possible, use inner joins. Oracle B2C Service Analytics typically defaults to inner joins, but where configuration is applied or required, use inner joins when appropriate. For example, suppose you need a list of incidents with associated organization information. If you join the Incidents table to the Organizations table using an outer join, the result set returned will be those incidents that have organization information as well as incidents that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have organization information. However, if you use an inner join, the data returned will only be those incident records that contain organization information. Therefore, the resulting data set using an inner join will be smaller than with an outer join, and more targeted. If using an outer join, make sure you need it.

All the Service Cloud application components are deployed into the agents Windows profiles directories of %local%\Apps\2.0 and %AppData%\Roaming\RightNow_Technologies. Since these directories are not static on an image or published desktop, agents can deploy the application without admin interaction. Please note: If a Citrix or Windows profile management application is used, an exclusion must be in place for the Â  Â %local%\Apps\2.0 folder. Â  Â The Service Cloud application uses Microsoft's ClickOnce technology to deploy the application components. This process stores the deployment manifest and some components in the Â  Â %local%\Apps\2.0 directory. Since the subfolders of this directory are named using a auto generated alpha-numerical naming process during folder creation, recreating those folders can rename them. Renaming those folders will break the Service Cloud application and force the removal and redeployment of the application.

Credit Card and Social Security Number Masking in the PC (PCI) or FG Pod;Answer ID 5622;How does credit card number and social security number masking work in the PC orÃ‚Â FG pod?;['Answer ID 9570', 'Answer ID 7856'];   PCI/DSS, PC pod,Ã‚Â FG pod, masking Oracle B2C Service;"  Masking Primary Account Numbers (PANs) is a feature for sites in the PC or FG pod, i.e. credit card and social security numbers. By default the F5 Load Balancers (the ""Application Scanning Modules"" or ""Web Application Firewalls"" in the F5s) will mask the PANs when accessing the site via the Agent Desktop or Web interface. Example: ****-****-****-**** or ***-**-****  Additional helpful masking information:  -CC and SSN masking are configured separately. You can enable one or both. -It will scan everything (subject, body, including custom fields). -Since forwarding incidents results in sending emails outside the Oracle B2C Service application, it is not recommended to forward incidents outside of your organization. CC and SSN will not be masked outside of CX. Therefore, if an agent replies to an incident with a credit card number or Â SSN, while it will appear masked on the agents end, the customer would see that information in the email recieved. -There are two types of masking: in the admin console, or on enduser page (for a specific url). - The pods use Luhn algorithm (checksum formula) to determine whether or not the number is a CC or SSN. Random numbers will NOT be masked. -CC and SSN masking is interface specific for incidents and site wide for chat. -A change request has to be made by the Primary Support Contact of your organization via an service request. The service request will then be escalated to our Cloud Hosting Management Team to make the change.   For more information on Â implementing in a regulated environment such as PCI or HIPAA, please see Answer ID 9570: Guidance for Implementing in PCI or HIPAA Service Cloud Environment Â for specific deployment considerations. See also Answer ID 7856: Social Security Number not getting masked in chat transcript Â for more information on masked formats."

PCI (PC Pod) Frequently Asked Questions;Answer ID 5623;What are some FAQs regarding the PC Pod (PCI)?;['Answer ID 8758', 'Answer ID 9570'];   PCI/DSS, PC pod;"  Below are just a few considerations for implementing an Oracle B2C Service site within the PCI pod. Â  See the Â Guidance documentation (link below) for more information. 1. What level of certification is the Payment Card Industry (PCI) environment (PC Pod)?  Oracle B2C Service Â is certified as a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Service Provider Level I, which is the highest level available/possible.  2. Will our customers credit card/social security number information be masked/encrypted?  Yes, customer sites in the PCI Cloud may store PANs (Primary Account Number, i.e. Credit Card Number) and/or SSNs in their databases. By default the F5 Load Balancers (the ""Application Scanning Modules"" or ""Web Application Firewalls"" in the F5s) will mask the PANs when accessing the site via the Agent Desktop or Web interface. Example: ****-****-****-**** or ***-**-****  3. What is shared in the PCI environment?  Everything is shared (all hardware) except: - Exchange root - Â Own DB - Unique authentication credentials at the database tier - Own application environment  4. Can we still use our custom domain in the PC pod?  Yes, however, an SSL certificate from a vendor (Digicert is recommended) and SSL support will need to be purchased. It is recommended to reach out to your Sales Account Executive for purchasing information. Another option would be to use a custhelp.com domain that we provide you.  5. How do we obtain vulnerability scans and/or penetration tests of your site?  Customers sometimes request to perform their own vulnerability scans or penetration tests on their PCI site(s). Â Oracle B2C Service does not permit this under any circumstances for routine audits. We will provide third-party scan and audit reports to current PCI customers, under an NDA. Speak to your Sales Account Manager for additional information.  6. Is HTTP supported on the PC Pod?  All sites in the PC Pod must be HTTPS. We do not support HTTP traffic to these environments. Any work-around solution will require an Oracle Consulting Services engagement, to securely transport the data.  7. What will happen to my customizations?  Site customizations in the PCI environment must be reviewed prior to moving into the PCI Cloud, and then once annually. This is reviewed during the pre-screen and security audit process prior to the PCI migration. Customizations will either be OK'd by Â Oracle Consulting or if additional changes to the customization(s) are need to be made for them to be compliant, they will be scoped by Oracle Consulting.  8. When should the actual migration be scheduled?  It is suggested for the migration to be conducted during down business hours when the least amount of agents and customers will be affected.  9. What is the expected downtime during migration?  Every customer is different. Typical downtime depends on size of site and customizations. Length of migration depends on a number of factors, and primarily from experience the number of mailboxes plays a large role in the time it takes. Each mailbox has to perform an LDAP call back to CA which is time consuming. Time allotted for DNS to propagate around the world is also expected. However, there is a process in place that will allow agents and end-users to access your site from the previous pod until DNS propagates. It all depends on where the agent/end-user is located. Agents may or may not need to log in and out of the application.  10. What protocols are supported for secure channel pop email?  - SSL/TLS for transmission of web inquiries and chat conversations  - S/MIME for end-to-end secure delivery of email - Opportunistic TLS on our SMTP gateways - We do not support pop3s for email retrieval   For additional information, please see the Â PCI DSS Responsibility Matrix. For more information on Â implementing in a regulated environment such as PCI or HIPAA, please see Answer ID 9570: Guidance for Implementing in PCI or HIPAA Service Cloud Environment Â for specific deployment considerations. If additional information is needed, please speak to your Sales Account Manager."

Are you currently and do you wish to continue using custom URLS? Have you white listed the following IP addresses: 74.117.200.0/24 255.255.255.0 Do you currently have any projects in flight? What are your current customizations and/or crons associated with your site on its current pod? Ensure port 993 and/or 995 is open for mail. What types of outbound integrations do you have in place and what protocols do you support? Sftp? Webdav? Do you have any add-ins? If so, please provide the source code. Will any kind of sensitive data be received (CCs, SSNs, HIPAA-classified, etc)?

"Error adding/editing custom fields or custom objects: ""The following table(s) have exceeded the maximum row size.""";Answer ID 5626;How to address reaching maximum row size on custom objects / custom fields.;['Answer ID 8758', 'Answer ID 9570'];"   Not product specific - MySQL limitation, Custom Fields, Custom Objects.  Issue    I'm not allowed to add new custom fields, or edit the current ones. I get an error that the table has exceeded its maximum row size.   OR   I'm not able to make changes toÃ‚Â custom objects, or create new ones. I get an error that the CO classÃ‚Â has exceeded its maximum row size.   OR   ""The following table(s) have exceeded the maximum row size.""";  The design intent of newer versions of the Oracle Â Service Cloud Â application is such that custom field usage should be phased out and replaced by the use of custom objects where applicable. To further performance tune the application and facilitate lightweight API implementation, core table row sizes are being constrained to 32k bytes. This size limitation is a combined total of all custom fields, and for pending changes to custom object attributes. If your custom fields are too large, you may not be able to make changes to your custom objects. The old model of using custom fields has proven inefficient because often the custom field is not used by the majority of records in the table. In many cases custom fields are grouped into folders and it is unlikely that all fields will be populated for each record. The custom field methodology apportions table space to all these fields for every record, regardless of their use. Alternatively, the new custom object methodology allows a new table (object) to be created in the database to store these data items, and a row is added to that table only when data exists. The custom object rows are joined to the incident rows by a common key, usually the opportunity_id, contact_id, incident_id, etc,. and a parent relationship is defined between the table and the custom object. You may also find that custom objects will allow enhanced use of the workflow dynamics of the application. Instead of creating a monolithic incident workspace with myriads of tabs and sub-tabs, Workflows allow you to create specific workspaces that align to your incident creation process. The path or flow between each workspace can be guided by decision points and workspaces that correlate to custom objects which can be integrated as needed. Please note that even if you switch over to custom objects, each object also has a limit of 32k to work with. However, you can utilize numerous objects working in concert to exceed this limitation. Â Also note that simply reducing the size of fields is inadequate as the product reserves the maximum possible size, regardless of the current settings for the length of fields Currently, there Â are some circumstances in which custom Â fields cannot be fully replaced by custom objects due to functionality limitations (namely exposure to business rules and CPMs). However, it is strongly recommended that business processes be evaluated to prioritize the use of custom objects Â over that of custom fields. This way, the subsequent use of custom fields is as streamlined and efficient as possible. Our Â Oracle Consulting team Â can assist you in improving your business processes to work more effectively by employing custom objects to store ancillary data. Contact your Sales Representative / Account Manager to Â help you with setting up a meeting with Oracle Consulting to discuss the details of your needs. If you need further assistance, please submit a question via Ask Technical Support.

Incident Subject line is same as customer's question;Answer ID 5629;WhyÃ‚Â is the incident Subject line the same as the customer's question?;['Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â Ã‚Â   Incident submission Oracle B2C Service,Ã‚Â May 2011 and newerÃ‚Â releases;  When a customer asks (submits) a question, an incident is created in Oracle B2C Service, and the Subject field of the incident is the same as the Subject field the customer completes on the Ask a Question page. Â  Â  However, if you remove the Subject field from the Ask a Question page, Oracle B2C Service Â automatically populates the incidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Subject field with the first 80 characters of the customerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s question. For incidents created with a missing subject from .NET and BUI, the subject is populated with the first 236 characters of the thread entry.

Disable learned links in RelatedAnswers2 widget;Answer ID 5632;Is it possible to disable learned links from the RelatedAnswer2 widget but still show manually created links?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, Learned links, Manually related links, Customer Portal;"  The Â RelatedAnswers2 widget is designed to Â show both the manually related links and learned links. The logic behind displaying links works this way: It will first grab all manually related answers and then any learned link answers if size permits. The answer size is the 'limit' attribute passed to the RelatedAnswers2 widget. Please refer to the widget documentation to get more details on this widget. You can also access the Widgets page of the Customer Portal Administration site by typing https://&lt;your_site&gt;/ci/tags/widgets in your web browser. You must log in with your username and password to access this page. Now if you would like to display only the manually related answers, there are two possible Â workaround options:  1. Assuming we have 2 manually related links to each answer we can set limit on RelatedAnswers2 widget to 2 which will make sure only the manual links will be displayed. 2. Add a custom widget similar to RelatedAnswers2 which excludes learned links. Learned link answers do not have a static_strength set in the links table. So to preserve manually related linked answers and block learned link answers, build a custom widget that queries the links table and filters on static_strength column where the value is greater than 0. Â    Notes: If you need help building a custom widget, our Oracle Consulting team Â is able to provide consultation and customization for a standard consulting fee.

Detailed information about SmartAssistant AutoTuner;Answer ID 5635;What do coverage, confidence, implicit data, and explicit data mean in the context of SmartAssistant AutoTuner?;['Answer ID 6216', 'Answer ID 5168'];   SmartAssistant Autotuner Oracle B2C Service August 2013 and newer;  Explicit Data Explicit data refers to training data that is explicitly tagged or categorized. Â  Â In the case of the SmartAssistant AutoTuner, explicit data means incidents that have best answers selected for them. In comparison to implicit data, explicit data is more valuable because it is more accurate than implicit data. Explicit training data is used by the SmartAssistant AutoTuner to suggest recommendations and provide information about your current configuration. You can increase the amount of explicit training data scanned by the utility by associating 'Best Answers' to incidents. Â  Â For additional details regarding the Best Answers feature, please see Answer ID 6216: Information on the 'Best Answers' button in open incident. Implicit Data Implicit data is training data that is generated from uncategorized data based on heuristics. Â  Â In the case of SmartAssistant AutoTuner, we examine data from the user_trans table and make inferences about which answers might have resolved a given incident. It is specifically generated with the actions Append as Link and Append as Text. Implicit data is less accurate than explicit data due to the necessity of making those inferences. However, the data is essentially free in that no human effort is required to generate the data. Coverage Coverage concerns the percentage of the population that a sample represents. In the context of SmartAssistant AutoTuner, coverage is a measure of the number of answers that are included in the training data compared to the total number of answers. The higher the percentage of answers included in the training data, the more likely it is that the training is representative of real life usage. Confidence Confidence is a measure of how likely the SmartAssistant AutoTuner's suggestion is to actually improve SmartAssistant relevancy. Confidence can be improved by increasing the amount of explicit data available to the AutoTuner. To increase the amount of explicit training data, mark the best answer for incidents that agents have resolved.

Adding meta tags to answers;Answer ID 5668;How do I add a meta tag to answers or to a specific answer?;['Answer ID 2600'];   Customer portal, answers, search engines, Google, show_on_pages condition page tag;"  Most of the pages in customer portal, such as /app/answers/detail Â do not contain the HTML head section. Â  Therefore it is impossible to add header meta tags directly to the detail.php file or to the answer content. However, by using a customer portal condition page tag you can add meta tags to the head section of the template that will appear when a page is compiled. For example adding the following code to the template will add a ""nosnippet"" meta tag to the answers. Â  Â The nosnippet tag changes the way results appear in Google's search results.  &lt;rn:condition show_on_pages=""/answers/detail""&gt; &lt;meta name=""googlebot"" content=""nosnippet""&gt; &lt;/rn:condition&gt;  Unfortunately the page condition tag does not work for individual answers such as the example of Â adding a ""no index"" tag to a specific answer. Â  Therefore the page condition tag can be used with some PHP code. Â  The following is an example for excluding answer id 12345 from search results on compliant search engines. Â  Note that this code is an example and a robust version designed by your developers should be used on production sites. Also the example works with in an out-of-the-box configuration and may not work with URLs that contain search terms and/or product and category URL parameters.  &lt;rn:condition show_on_pages=""answers/detail""&gt; &lt;?  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â $x = 'a_id/12345';  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â if(strstr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'a_id/') == $x) {  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â echo ""&lt;META NAME=\""ROBOTS\"" CONTENT=\""NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW\""&gt;"";  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â } ?&gt; &lt;/rn:condition&gt;  For more information on the robots meta tag please refer to http://www.robotstxt.org/meta.html.

Invalid Address  Occurs Â if sender's From or Reply-to address is longer than 80 characters or does not match Â a valid email format.  Â Refer to Answer ID 6381: Email address limitation Â    Sender address  Check to see if the From address of the message matches any value(s) set in the Discard Addresses filter. This exists also in the mailboxes.discard_email field. Beginning in 17D: The EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED configuration setting as been renamed to EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_MODE. Â  Â This setting determines the level of security applied when updating an incident by email.  Supported values are: 0 - Updating an incident by email is allowed from any email address based on reference number match only. IMPORTANT! SETTING THIS VALUE TO 0 MAY IMPACT SECURITY OR PRIVACY CONCERNS FOR YOUR SITE. 1 - Updating an incident by email is allowed from any email address only if the originating message includes a tracking string indicating a match to the site and incident in question. If a ref_no exists in the subject but no tracking information is found, then an incident will be created if EGW_UPDATE_BY_CREATE is set to 1. 2 - Updating an incident by email is allowed only when the Reply-to or From address of the email message is listed in the contact record associated with the incident (that is, the primary or alternate email addresses). Default is 2. In August 2017 and earlier: Â  If EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED is set to Yes and the From address of the message does not match the email address of the contact record associated to the incident, the message will be filtered. *Note: If EGW_UPDATE_BY_CREATE is enabled in conjunction with EGW_SECURE_UPDATE_ENABLED, the incoming email that does not match the email address associated to the incident will not be blocked completely, but it will create a separate incident. IF EGW_LOOP_PREVENT_ENABLED is set to Yes and the Reply-To address of the message matches the Reply-To, From, Friendly From address of ANY mailbox configured in their site, it will be filtered.  Sender address - BCC  An email reply sent from a recipient that was included in the Â BCC field Â for an incident response. In this case, they Â will get filtered and sent a 'Request Denied' message. Â   Sender is our own mailbox  Any email where the reply-to email address Â matches the reply-to email address of any mailbox in Oracle B2C Service will be discarded and no incident will be created. In this way, the mailbox deletes any messages from itself. This is controlled by the EGW_LOOP_PREVENT_ENABLED configuration. Please note, while this can be turned off it is not recommended since this is a guard against serious email loops. Email loops can break the techmail utility and halt all messages until the underlying cause is addressed.    Header content  Check the mailbox configuration and the Discard Headers Â filter. Â If something contained within the message header Â matches Â an entry in the Discard Headers filter, the message will be filtered. Â Items should be return delimited.       Subject content  Check the mailbox configuration and the Discard Subject filters. If something contained within the subject of the message matches an entry in the Discard Subjects filter, the message will be filtered. Items should be return delimited.       Body content  Check the mailbox configuration and the Discard Body filters. If something contained within the body of the message matches an entry in the Discard Body filter, the message will be filtered. Items should be return delimited.       Bulk precedence  This will occur when two conditions are met. The header of the message will have the Content-Type Â Precedence set to ""Bulk"", Â  ""Junk"" or ""List"" Â AND the mailbox is configured to ""Delete Bulk Messages."" The issue can be resolved by either unchecking the ""Delete Bulk Messages"" box within the mailbox configuration, or have the customer work with their mail administrator to remove the ""Bulk"" precedence being set for their messages.   Auto-responder  This will occur based on the ""Discard Automatic Responses"" value set within the mailbox's configuration matches. This can be set to Off, Conservative, Moderate or Aggressive and the values are set in the corresponding configuration values. Note, there is a separate configuration value for the header and body portion of the message. Conservative - EGW_AR_CONS_BODY_FLTR, EGW_AR_CONS_HEAD_FLTR Moderate - EGW_AR_MODR_BODY_FLTR, EGW_AR_MODR_HEAD_FLTR Aggressive - EGW_AR_AGGR_BODY_FLTR, EGW_AR_AGGR_HEAD_FLTR This can also occur via the EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS configuration.The EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS Â setting specifies the maximum number of emails that will be accepted from an individual email address within the time period specified in the EGW_MAX_MSG_DURATION setting. This is used to identify and stop auto-responder email loops. Setting EGW_MAX_PER_ADDRESS to 0 disables the email loop detection. The default value is 23.  Note: Â  These configuration settings are set at the per interface level. Â  Â However, they function as the maximum per mailbox associated to the interface the configurations are set. To help illustrate the 'per mailbox' functionality: - If a contact is sending 25 emails to the same mailbox (mailbox_id 1) within 12 hours, only 23 incidents will be created and the last 2 messages will be discarded; - If a contact is sending 33 emails to 3 different mailboxes (10 emails to mailbox_id 1, 11 emails to mailbox_id 2 and 12 emails to mailbox_id 3) 33 incidents will be created and no email will be discarded.    Duplicate email  A duplicate email will be filtered when any email having the same date within four hours, Â from email addresses (i.e. Sent to the same mailbox from the same sender), subject, and body as an existing incident is found. Â  Â This is controlled by the EGW_DISCARD_DUPLICATE_ENABLED configuration setting.  NOTE: Beginning in the May 2015 release, the file attachment name, type, and size is also considered when processing potential duplicate messages. Â Starting in this version, the specific mailbox is now ignored, so a message can be sent to multiple configured mailboxes within the site and be considered a duplicate. Â  Examples: - Two messages with the same from, subject, content, and file attachment. This should cause duplicate to be discarded. - Two messages with the same from, subject, content, but for the file attachment, name them identically but be sure the sizes vary (easiest with text or word files, make one very long). This should not be considered a duplicate and should create two incidents in the system. - Two messages with the same from, subject, content, and file attachment sent to two different mailboxes that exist within the same site. This should cause a duplicate to be discarded.    Customer disabled  Check the contact record and make sure the record is not Disabled. Check contacts.disabled field. If the contact is disabled, the message will be filtered.   Bad reply format  If EGW_REPLY_BETWEEN_ENABLED=1 AND mailbox configuration Ã¢â‚¬Å“Force Reply Between Lines"" is enabled, then the message did not contain the content between the lines correctly and the message will be filtered. The REPLY_BEGIN_MSG and REPLY_END_MSG message bases define the top and bottom of reply area. Check these configurations along with the message to ensure: -Reply strings are not getting truncated -Reply strings match the message base for the interface -There are no extraneous characters or HTML formatting being added   SLA required  Check to see if the customer's site requires an SLA be applied to a contact and/or organization in order to receive service. If so and the contact and/or organization does not have an SLA applied, the message will be filtered.   Account required  Check the EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE and EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE_MA configuration settings. If either of these Â are not enabled, and the contact record does not already exist, the message will be filtered.   Workflow rules  This is caused when an incident rule has specifically prevented the creation of the incident with the rule action of Do Not Create incident. Search for all rules with an action of Do Not Create incident.       S/MIME signature and S/MIME decryption  This is caused when the mailbox is configured for S/MIME and the message does not match the pre-loaded root certificates or certificates which have been added through the File Manager. Check the mailbox configuration settings related to S/MIME and/or the ""Additional root certificates"" directory in the File Manager.      Message MTA  When the email came from postmaster or mailer daemon.   Unsubscribe  When the email is a marketing Â  Â unsubscribe email.   SSS response Â   When the email is a social self-service response which is a response to a question.   Other Database/From different DB  The Â tracking string in the outgoing message contains site information along with incident, or mailing details. If the message string does not match the site in which the message is being sent to, it will be filtered."

Pod/Datacenter  Migrations/Transports General Process;Answer ID 5688;What information doÃ‚Â we need to know aboutÃ‚Â a pod migration/transport and how it works?;['Answer ID 331'];   Pod/Datacenter Migration/Transport;"  What is a pod/datacenter migration/transport? A pod or datacenter is where the sites (instances) are hosted by Oracle. There are various pods all over the world. A pod migration/transport is when sites are moved to a different pod. Why move the site to a different pod? There are many reasons to request a different pod. Every scenario is different based on customer business needs. Will a pod migration affect Configuration Assistant self-service tool? Yes. The Configuration Assistant uses the pod that the site is hosted on in the url (ossc-&lt;pod&gt;.custhelp.com). Â  The contract/license change process includes the back end entitlement information which affects the Configuration Assistant. Â  After the contract/license changes are complete, you will not be able to access the Configuration Assistant until the site(s) are physically on the new pod. Â  How is the pod determined? The pod that your site(s) is hosted on is determined during the sales/provisioning processes of the initial site/instance purchase.  Â Oracle B2C Service Technical Support has no insight into this decision. Questions regarding this decision should be addressed with your sales account manager. Â  What is happening while moving the production site? An internal transport site is created, which is a running duplicate of the production site. The internal Â transport site is moved to the new pod while the active production site is still on the old pod. Then, databases are compared and synchronized. Once the synchronization is completed, all live traffic is directed to the new pod and final transport steps are completed. During these processes, your production site will be moved into maintenance mode. The standard maintenance page will be displayed. The average time to complete the cutover steps on the production site is between 5 and 30 minutes. However, until DNS fully propagates, an ""HTTP 404"" message may be displayed. Â  What is the overall process of a pod migration/transport? 1. The customer determines that they need to move their sites to a different pod. Â  2. The customer needs to contact their sales account manager and process the pod migration request. Because the pod is part of the contract with Oracle, the contract will need to be updated.  Â This process must be completed by the sales account manager. Â  NOTE: Â   The Configuration Assistant self-service tool (ossc-xx.custhelp.com) is based off the information in the contract. Therefore, during the time between when the contract is changed and sites are physically moved to the new pod, the Configuration Assistant will not be able to display the sites. During this time, customers will need to submit service requests for the tasks that are needed. It is helpful to mention in the service request that a pod migration is currently in progress. Â   3. Once the contract is updated, the customer can submit a service request to Oracle B2C Service Technical Support team (cx.rightnow.com) to request a pod migration.  Â The Technical Support agent co-ordinates the request with the internal team. Â  Â  NOTES:  Please allow for at least 7 Â business days for scheduling the request. The pod migration process is not a simple task. Please allow for ample time to complete the entire process for each site being migrated/transported. Due the complexity of the tasks to move the sites to a new pod, errors can be encountered that can delay the processes. Our teams make every effort to resolve any issues encountered as quickly as possible. Â  Test site(s) will be migrated/transported first. IF there are no test sites, then a ""sitename__mig"" (migration) site will be created by cloning the production site to a new/separate temporary test site and moving to the new pod. Â  Customer should provide the designated test site to be migrated when submitting the service request. Â   4. Technical Support agent updates customer that the test site has been scheduled to be migrated to the new pod. 5. Technical Support agent updates customer Â when test site has been migrated and is ready to be accessed. Â  6. Customer will test on the test site.  NOTES:  As every customer has different configuration and business practices, there is no standard steps of what to test. It is recommended that customer test their typical Â business processes, tasks, and functions. Â  If there are multiple test sites, customer will need to update service request with next test site to migrate to the new pod. Â   7. Customer updates the service request to proceed with production site migration/transport.  Â Please allow for ample scheduling time (at least 7 business days).  Â  8. Technical Support agent co-ordinates production site schedule for migration/transport with internal team.  Â Agent updates the service request to notify customer of schedule. Â  9. The production site is transported to the new pod and the internal team notifies the Technical Support agent. Please note, we are unable to predict how long this process will take as it can vary greatly due to many factors. Â  10. The Technical Support agent updates the customer. Â  To help to ensure a smooth migration/transport, please note following items that should be avoided during a pod migration/transport.  Refrain from executing broadcast mailings during the 24 hour period prior to the cutover to ensure mailings aren't interrupted as part of the migration cutover. Please do not conduct a Customer Portal deploy during the 24 hour period prior to the cutover to ensure consistency with the final site migration cutover. Please do not submit any upgrade site requests until after all pod migration tasks are completed. An upgrade and pod migration/transport cannot occur simultaneously. Â  Please refrain from making Custom Business Object deployments or Custom Field changes during the scheduled time of pod migration. Â   What changes are needed on the customers' side prior to the transport cutover? Organizations have different policies for internet access. Many organizations do not restrict outbound internet access (i.e. employees can access anything on the internet), if that is your policy, then there will be no changes required. Select organizations deploy restrictions for access based on content or site names (i.e. social networks, game sites), if that is Â your policy, then you are likely to not need to make any changes but it is important to validate. Other organizations deploy very rigid access policies by selecting specific IP addresses that can access in or out of the internal corporate networks. In this scenario, a change to the network access policy will be required to allow the Oracle IP range.  Â  If you are hosting your own service mailboxes (responsible for incident creation and updates) externally to Oracle, you will need to work with your 3rd party provider to ensure that the provider accepts inbound requests from the communicated IP ranges on ports 110 and 443. What changes are needed on the customers' side after the transport cutover? After cutover, you will want to check all of the Â mailboxes Â that have any address Â using the custhelp.com domain Â are prepended with the new pod designation. For example, if you are migrating from the MW pod to the VA pod, your current custhelp.com domain addresses should look like example@mailmw.custhelp.com. After the cutover, the addresses should be Â example@mailva.custhelp.com. If the addresses are not set to the new pod, please edit the address fields in the mailboxes component to match the new pod designation. Â  Verifying the new pod designation ensures that your email is being routed properly through our Â infrastructure and provides for better email performance. *Note: If you are forwarding mail to an Oracle hosted mailbox, please change the forward to match the new pod designation as well to improve email performance. Email will still be processed if sent to the old pod designation, but it will take more hops to get to where it needs to be.    "

When a business rule contains a search field, which itself containsÃ‚Â two (or more) consecutive asterisks ('*')Ã‚Â you will recieve the error message of ""Parsing "".... **"" - Nested quantifier *."""; To resolve this error you will need to Â edit the relevant business rule and remove the double asterisk. Â  A single asterisk will have the desired effect or the asterisks can be removed completely. Â  The error message will normally contain the contents of the search field ending with the double asterisk, to assist in locating the relevant rule. You can also use the Rule Log to identify which rules the incident matched. Additional information is available in Answer ID 1873: Using the Rule Log to troubleshoot rules.

Â  This occurs whether a Response was actually sent or not. Â  Â The ""incident.Response Sent"" flag, on the other hand, is only set to ""True"" if both of the following are met:  a. Â  ""Send On Save"" is selected b. Â  Â The incident contains an Â uncommitted Response thread  This means that when an agent saves an incident and ""Send On Save"" is selected, the ""incident.Response Sent"" flag Â is set to ""True"" if the incident contains an uncommitted Response thread. Â  Consequently, the incident will match any rule condition requiring the flag be set to ""True"" during this pass through the rule base. Â  Subsequent passes through the rule base, however, will not match the rule condition because the ""incident.Response Sent"" flag will have been reset back to ""False"" and will remain set to ""False"" until another uncommitted Response thread is sent. Â  The following steps illustrate a Â couple scenarios that may arise when using the ""incident.Response Sent"" functionality: SCENARIO I: Â  Incident Audit Log contains a ""Response Sent"" transaction Â BUT ""incident.Response Sent"" EQUALS ""True"" rule did Â NOT fire  1. Â  Agent opens an incident and enters a Response thread 2. Â  Agent saves the incident but does NOT select ""Send On Save"" 3. Â  The ""Commit Response on Save"" Â Response Option is enabled for the Incident workspace associated to the agent's profile so the response is committed to the incident (but is not saved) 4. Â  No ""Response Sent"" transaction is written to the Audit Log and the ""incident.Response Sent"" flag remains set to ""False"". Â  Rule does not fire. Â  5. Â  Agent realizes he/she did not actually send the response 6. Â  Â Agent selects ""Send On Save"" but does Â NOT enter a new uncommitted Response thread 7. Â  Agent saves the incident 8. Â  Agent receives a prompt stating, ""You have indicated that you want to send a response, but did not enter a response. Â   Â Are you sure you want to proceed?"" 9. Â  Agent selects ""OK"" and the incident is saved 10. Â  A ""Response Sent"" transaction is written to the Audit Log because the incident response message containing all existing incident threads is sent to the incident's contact BUT the ""incident.Response Sent"" flag remains set to ""False"" because no *new* response was actually sent. Â  Rule does not fire. Â   SCENARIO II: Incident Audit Log contains a ""Response Sent"" transaction Â AND ""incident.Response Sent"" EQUALS ""True"" rule fired!  1. Â  Agent opens an incident and enters a Response thread 2. Â  Agent saves the incident but does NOT select ""Send On Save"" 3. Â  The ""Commit Response on Save"" Response Option Â is enabled for the Incident workspace associated to the agent's profile so the response is committed to the incident (but is not saved) 4. Â  No ""Response Sent"" transaction is written to the Audit Log and the ""incident.Response Sent"" flag remains set to ""False"". Rule does not fire. 5. Â  Agent realizes he/she did not actually send the response 6. Â  Agent copies the contents in the committed Response thread and pastes them into a new uncommitted Response thread 7. Â  Agent selects ""Send On Save"" 8. Â  Agent saves the incident 9. Â  A ""Response Sent"" transaction is written to the Audit Log because ""Send On Save"" was selected AND the incident contained an uncommitted response thread. Â  Additionally, the ""incident.Response Sent"" flag Â is set to ""True"" Â because Â a *new* response was sent during this transaction. Rule conditions are met and rule fires!  Cause: Â  The ""Response Options"" within an Incident workspace allow you to configure the functionality surrounding saving and sending incidents. Â  Please consider altering these options to better suit your business practices."

Do we need to use the Server Fallback when using the Shared Network Location;Answer ID 5712;We have set the Shared Network Location (SNL), do we need to use the Server Fallback?;['Answer ID 1243', 'Answer ID 1243', 'Answer ID 1243'];  Shared Network Location (SNL), November 2011 and later releases;" When set, the Server Fallback allows the agent's console to pull update files from the RightNow servers should the Share Network Location (SNL) be set and not be available to agents. When the SNL is set Â and the Server Fallback is not set; agents are only able to pull updates from Â the SNL. Agents can not Â pull the update files directly from the Oracle B2C Service servers. Â In this case, if an update is applied to Â a site and the SNL is not available or reachable by the agent's console, they will not be able to log in. "

What is the Shared Network Location used for?;Answer ID 5713;Should I use the Shared Network location (SNL), what is it for?;['Answer ID 1243', 'Answer ID 1243', 'Answer ID 1243'];   Oracle B2C Service, All supported versions;  The SNL (Shared Network Location) was designed to reduce Â bandwidth utilization of the Â Oracle B2C Service Â application during Maintenance Pack application or site update. This deployment option locally mirrors the update components on the Â Oracle B2C Service Â servers. When the SNL is set to a network share within your organization, the first client who detects an available update will download the application files in a zip format to the SNL location. Those files are then copied and extracted to the application files location. The application zip files are retained in the SNL and accessed by the remaining clients upon subsequent logins. Using the SNL reduce the number of clients downloading the application zip files from the Â Oracle B2C Service servers. This reduces bandwidth utilization during update or update process. The SNL can be defined for an entire site, for specific profiles, or both. If both are defined, the profile location setting will override the site location. For details on setting the SNL, please refer to the Deployment Guide for your version of Oracle B2C Service. When setting the SNL please consider the following: The SNL is designed to reduce bandwidth during updating of the Oracle B2C Service application. Setting the SNL to a location on a workstation such as C:\SNL is not advised. Each workstation will download the zip files and thus increase bandwidth. The SNL should be a network location available to each agent's console. For each agent Â who the SNL is defined for, they Â must have Read/Write access to the SNL location.

Oracle B2C Service Maintenance FAQs;Answer ID 5722;What do I need to know about the maintenance windows for my OracleÃ‚Â Service CloudÃ‚Â site?;['Answer ID 1243', 'Answer ID 1243', 'Answer ID 1243'];   Maintenance windows Oracle B2C Service;"  Below are Frequently Asked Questions for End-Users regarding open scheduled change windows to update the Management Framework of the Â Oracle B2C Service Â platform.  What are maintenance windows and why are they required?  Maintenance windows are a declared time window to conduct infrastructural updates within the Oracle Cloud Computing environment. Maintenance executed during this time is intended to improve the overall stability through enhancing the below areas:  Replace end of life hardware Resolve infrastructure software defects Upgrade hardware/network infrastructure Deploy new service technologies Update infrastructure security    When do maintenance windows occur?  Maintenance windows can potentially occur any Friday at 21:00 local data center time. Â  All datacenters located in North and South America potentially Â have a simultaneous maintenance window at 2:00 AM Coordinated Universal Time, each Friday, regardless of their time zone. Â  Â Each time period has been confirmed to have low traffic volumes for both agents and end-users. Â If possible, specific times will be provided in maintenance window notifications. See also Support Notifications &gt; Support Updates for important service notifications relating to system updates.    Are the days/times of the outages negotiable?  They are not negotiable. These times have been identified as low traffic volume time periods. Due to the shared cloud nature of the product, maintenance executed may not be site specific but rather cloud wide.    What service/product impacts can I expect during a maintenance window?  Due to the redundancy of the cloud environment most maintenance events will have little to no visible impact to the CX product or its services. Maintenance can often be executed on the slave/secondary resource and then failed over to work on the prior master/primary resource.    How will I know if a maintenance window is anticipated to cause service/product impact?  The Oracle Cloud Operations team will make every effort to send communications 1 Â week Â prior to every maintenance window to detail what the customer/agent impact may be during the upcoming maintenance window. If any services are anticipated to be impacted, the proactive notification will attempt to detail what specific services will be affected and the anticipated duration.    What if the experience observed during a maintenance window is different than the one originally communicated?  During a maintenance window, all applicable subject matter experts are present making the necessary environmental changes. In addition, very specific deployment schedules will be followed. If the experienced impact of the maintenance window deviates from the originally anticipated impact, then the Oracle Cloud Operations team will send additional notifications to provide additional updates throughout the event."

Disposition automatically changes to 'no value';Answer ID 5725;Why does the Disposition automatically change to 'no value' when opening an incident for edit?;['Answer ID 1243', 'Answer ID 1243', 'Answer ID 1243']; Ã‚Â  Incidents, Workspace, Product Linking; The behavior outlined is standard behavior when product to disposition links are removed. Â  Â  To correct this, you will either want to re-link the disposition or sub-disposition or update the affected incidents and set a valid disposition association based on their product association. Notes: From Â the incidents table at the database level, the associated disposition value may still exist. Â  Â This is why you're likely Â able to pull reports based on that value. Â  Â However, once the record is opened for edit, the application displays the product value and adjusts the Disposition field listing accordingly, based on current product to disposition links. Â  Â Because the previously selected value is no longer linked to the current product selected, it is not displayed when the record is opened. Â  Â The result of this is that the Disposition field will display No Value.

Â  Â According to our Development team, when an agent switches modes from Source -&gt; Design -&gt; Source, Tidy strips &lt;style&gt; HTML element from HTML body and attempts to move to &lt;header&gt; section; however, header is not a part of Answer content. Â  Â This is by design, i.e., Tidy always remove everything outside the body tag. Essentially, as &lt;head&gt; content elements such as &lt;link&gt; are intended to be inserted into the &lt;head&gt; section of the answer page, and the answer content is intended to be &lt;body&gt; content only. To resolve this behavior, one option might be to insert the stylesheet link on your answers view page in Customer Portal.

Key Concepts in Intelligent Advisor;Answer ID 5774;What are the key concepts in Intelligent Advisor?;['Answer ID 2673'];   Intelligent Advisor,Ã‚Â latest release;   The following are the key concepts in Intelligent Advisor          Term  Definition       Policy Modeling  Policy Modeling is a desktop application used to develop policy models and interactive interviews based on business requirements, policy and legislation.     Hub  Intelligent Advisor Hub is a browser-based management console which provides policy modeling project and user administration functions.     Projects  Policy Modeling projects manage the rule documents, the data model and the interview definition that make up a policy model.     Attributes  An attribute is a unit of data or fact. Attributes can either have a true/false value or take on a variable value (for example, a number, date, text and so on).     Entities  An entity represents a group of things (for example, people, objects, concepts) with rules or data in common.     Relationships  A relationship defines how two entities relate to each other so that rules can be written that reason from one entity to another.     Data model    The data model in Policy Modeling consists of the entities, relationships and attributes that make up the policy model.       Data mapping    The connection of Intelligent Advisor entities and attributes to tables and fields in a data source.       Rules  Rules specify the logical relations between attributes and provide a framework against which attributes can be tested to determine their value. Rules describe relationships in terms of if-then logic.     Temporal reasoning  Temporal reasoning is the ability to reason with policy model attributes or outcomes for which the values change over time. Rules written in Policy Modeling are thus time-aware, operating simultaneously both at a specific point in time, as well as across time periods.     Translations    Translation documents are Excel files in which translations are maintained of all the text that can appear when projects are deployed. This allows you to deploy a single policy model in multiple languages, while continuing to develop the policy model in its original language.       Debugging  Debugging is the process of testing the logic of your rules to confirm that inputs match expected decisions.     Interviews  An interview is a web-based application which collects information from a user to find values for policy model goals.     Forms  A form is a document that can be generated from an interview to provide the user with a record of the interview, including answers and conclusions. Forms have many uses, including pre-filled claim forms and advice letters.     Explanations  An explanation is a tailored list of reasons about how the value of the goal attribute was determined. It can be added Â to an interview or form to give the reasons for a particular decision. It is most suitable for displaying to customers and agents.     Audit reports  An audit report is a complete list of reasons about how the value of the goal attribute was determined. It is available in connected interviews without requiring any report configuration. It is most suitable for displaying to auditors.     Rule testing  Policy testing is the act of reviewing the outcome of rules, usually to ensure the rules are returning the correct results.     Users  Intelligent Advisor users are needed for interacting with Intelligent Advisor Hub, for the purposes of managing project versions and deployment, and for administering other users.     Deployment  Deployment is the first step in the process of making a project snapshot available for Intelligent Advisor interview and web service interactions, and for use on mobile devices (the other step is activation). Deploying a project is performed in Policy Modeling. Â  Â Deployment is managed via Intelligent Advisor Hub.     Activation  Activation is the second step in the process of making a project snapshot 'go live' for end users (the other step is deployment). Activation can be performed within Policy Modeling at the time of deployment, or later from Intelligent Advisor Hub. End users can then interact with the policy model via the deployment option specified for it (as an Intelligent Advisor interview or as a web service or both).     Connections  Connections are used to retrieve metadata from external data sources such as Oracle B2C Service or web service data sources, and are how data is saved and loaded by interviews at runtime.     Collaboration  An optional set of features is available for collaborative policy modeling and versioning, allowing fine-grained version control for Policy Modeling project development, and supporting multi-developer projects. Managed from Intelligent Advisor Hub Repository tab. To enable these features contact your Oracle sales representative.     Value lists    A value list, otherwise known as an enumeration, is a tool for managing lists of potential values for a non-boolean attribute in your policy model.       Inclusions  An inclusion is a policy modeling project that has been imported into another policy modeling project for the purpose of reusing some or all of the projectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assets.     Reference Tags  The structural elements in legislation (section, paragraph, sub-paragraph and so on) or policy (guidance, chapter, criterion and so forth) can be annotated in rules using reference tags. By tagging conclusions and conditions with the applicable part of the source material, rule authors are able to easily keep track of, and show, the sources used in every decision.

Create a language translation for Intelligent Advisor model;Answer ID 5775;How is a language translation created for a policy model in Intelligent Advisor?;['Answer ID 2673'];   Intelligent Advisor,Ã‚Â latestÃ‚Â release;  You can translate an existing policy model into another language by adding translation documents to the project. Translation documents allow you to deploy a single policy model in multiple languages, while continuing to maintain your policy model in its original language. Translation documents are Excel files in which you specify your own translations of the relevant elements of the project, in any language you choose. Note that creating and running a translation document allows you to provide a language translation of your policy model only. It will not modify the formatting of data such as currency, date and number conventions and so on. These formats are set based on the project region setting for your original policy model. For more information on how to change these formats, see Configure the formatting of attribute values in an interview. Tip: Translation documents are demonstrated in the Travel Compensation example project, installed with Policy Modeling. What do you want to do? Create a translation file Add translations for policy model elements Debug a translation of a policy model Run a translation of a policy model Update a translation file Delete a translation file

Add a form to an Intelligent Advisor interview;Answer ID 5778;How is a form added to a Intelligent Advisor interview?;['Answer ID 2673'];   Intelligent Advisor,Ã‚Â latestÃ‚Â release;  A form is a document that can be generated from an Intelligent Advisor interview. It provides the user with a record of the interview, including answers and conclusions, that they can view and download. Forms have many uses, including pre-filled claim forms and advice letters. For example, if a person is applying for a benefit, product refund or completing a safety inspection, Intelligent Advisor can ensure all of the required data is collected and then generate the appropriate paperwork for the situation. Policy Modeling supports the creation of rich text format (RTF), PDF (including PDF/A), HTML, XML and Excel forms. After you have authored your policy model in Policy Modeling (including finalizing your data model) and you have tested it, you can then create a form by following these steps:  Add or import a form to the project You can either add a new form and the associated blank template file to the project, or alternatively, you can import an existing form and the associated template into the project.  Â  Design the template for the form You design RTF form templates in Microsoft Word using the BI Publisher Template Builder. You design PDF form templates in your preferred PDF editing tool using the Intelligent Advisor Â PDF Form Assistant.  Â  Add a form link to an interview screen You add a form link to the interview to enable the user to generate and view your form, or to save a copy of the form to a connected application.

How to receive/opt out of Service and Maintenance Notifications;Answer ID 5795;HowÃ‚Â can I add contacts to receive/opt out of Service and Maintenance Notifications?;['Answer ID 5722'];   Maintenance Notifications Communications from Oracle B2C Service;  Â  You can now update your notification perferences via your profile page. Â  There you can opt in or out of Auto Update notifications or of mailings from the Technical Support site. Â  If you are a contact with permissions to submit or update service requests, you are Â required to be opted-in to system and hosting notifications. Â  This is in the interest of ensuring that you've received any critical technical information that affects your site.  The notification Â options are:  Site Version Update Notifications Email notifications when new support contacts or contact managers are created Option Â to be added to severity 1 and 2 service requests Site status update notifications Â (service issues) Scheduled maintenance notifications Â (for further information, see Oracle B2C Service Maintenance FAQs) Ongoing communications and mailings from Oracle B2C Service Â   Notifications are sent to individuals marked as either Technical or Support contacts within customer's organization. It is very important for all organizations to continually review the contact list to ensure that the contact list is up to date and accurate to match your organization structure. Typically, these individuals are part of the teams that either own or manage the Oracle B2C Service application within their organizations or in other words, are accountable for Oracle B2C Service application to their organization. If you are a contact manager for your site, and someone has left your organization or is no longer in a support role, disabling them via the contact management tool Â will automatically turn off their system and hosting notifications. Â  If you are listed as a technical contact incorrectly, contact managers can also update your contact permissions via that tool. The Â Manage Hosting Notifications tool Â can be used to opt out users who do not have a support contact. This tool can be found in the Contact Management section of Site Tools and is only available for contact managers. Go Â here if you're unsure of who your contact manager is.

Unable to Connect to the Remote Server;Answer ID 5816;Why is an agent receiving an 'Unable to connect to the remote server' error when logging in to the OracleÃ‚Â Service CloudÃ‚Â console?;['Answer ID 5623'];  Oracle B2C Service versions February 2010 and newer Windows 7 Windows 8.1 Windows 10 Description  An agent can installÃ‚Â Oracle B2C Service from a site's launch page, and get to the login screen. After entering credentials and clicking 'Login', they receive the following error:  'Unable to connect to the remote server. Please make sure the site was entered correctly and that you are connected to the internet.'; This can occur if a workstation is using a calendar format that is unrecognized by Â the Oracle B2C Service application servers. For example, when Â using the Japanese calendar the workstation date format will show the year as '25'. The connection attempt will be rejected since the year must be between 1970 and 2038. Oracle B2C Service Â currently only supports Gregorian calendars where the year format shows as the range listed above. To resolve this issue the agent must change their workstation's calendar format.

Â  Â Scenarios involve re-associating a chat to an existing incident during the chat session. Â  Â When the chat ends, agents are prompted if they want to edit the incident. Â  Â The incident is not open at that point and they click 'Yes' to open the incident. Â  Â  1. In one scenario they right-click the incident tab and click ""close all"" which closes both the chat and the incident. Â  Â When they do this they are asked if they want to discard their edits. Â  Â It also mentions edits were made to multiple records and the chat is mentioned as the other record. Â  Â  2. In the second scenario they click the Refresh button in the incident workspace ribbon. Â  Â Again they are asked if they want to discard their edits and if they press yes the transcript is lost. Â  Â In this case the chat will close at that time and the incident will refresh so they can make new edits and save the incident.

There are too many spelling errors to continue displaying them;Answer ID 5842;"What causes the ""There are too many spelling errors to continue displaying them"" message to appear within an incident?";['Answer ID 5168'];   Spell Checking while editing an incident Workspaces, Incidents Oracle B2C Service;"  This message can be avoided by editing a workspace to utilize another method of Spell Check. Â  The impact of using another method other than ""As You Type"" for spell check is that misspellings will no longer be displayed in an uncommitted incident thread. Spell Check options Â for Rich Text Incident Thread Control are as follows:  TrueÃ¢â‚¬â€The fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spelling is checked when a staff member clicks the Spell Check button on the ribbon. FalseÃ¢â‚¬â€The fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spelling is never checked. As You TypeÃ¢â‚¬â€The fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spelling is checked automatically as the staff member types information in the field.  Cause: The ""There are too many spelling errors to continue displaying them"" message is displayed when text is pasted into an incident thread with more spelling errors than the application can display. Â  The purpose of this message is to Â be informative to the user and is not an indication of an error. Â  Even though all misspellings will not be displayed when this message occurs, Â a user may Â utilize the ""Spell Check"" button to review all misspellings for an uncommitted incident thread. This message will only occur on incident workspaces where the ""Spell Check -&gt; As You Type"" option is enabled.

Incidents are not escalating as expected;Answer ID 5844;An incident triggered the escalation chain rule, but why didn't it get escalated as expected?;['Answer ID 2015'];"  Business rules May 2011 and later releases Issue  An incident triggered the escalation chain rule which is configured to revalidate.Ã‚Â The incident was editedÃ‚Â and the status was changed to ""Holding"".Ã‚Â The escalation ruleÃ‚Â is not based on status. Why didn't the incident get escalated?";" When ""Revalidate"" is enabled in a rule, all rule conditions will be revalidated at the time of escalation to see if they still apply. The revalidate action is not limited to the rule conditions of the Â escalation rule. Because the escalation rule is in a function, the conditions of the rule which called the function will also be checked. In the example, Â since Â the rule which calls the escalation function has a condition that the status does not equal ""Holding"", then the revalidation will fail and the incident will not be escalated. For this reason, it is considered a best practice that each escalation function should be called only by rule(s) in a state. Those rules should not have any IF conditions which might not pass the revalidation check. Ideally, the rule which calls the escalation function should have no IF conditions. Any IF Â conditions should be within the escalation rule in the function.

Duplicate Contact Detected - Contact matches another exactly;Answer ID 5848;"How do I resolve the ""duplicate contact detected"" informational message?";['Answer ID 2831'];"   Sites with Email Address Sharing enabled  Issue   The login field was includedÃ‚Â in the simplistic duplicate criteria to include:   {(Email Address) OR (First Name) OR (Last Name)} AND {(Login)}   The complete algorithm can be found in the version specific documentation orÃ‚Â the answer related toÃ‚Â Householding - email address sharing.Ã‚Â  When attempting to create a duplicate contact that violates these conditions, a prompt stating the following will occur:   ""This contact exactly matches another contact's first name, last name, email and login values and cannot be saved at this time.""";  In order to create a duplicate contact for the same email address, you will need to make one of the fields unique. Â  Generally, the login field will be specific to the individual and will not be shared. Cause: In older versions contacts were allowed to have duplicate login values even though it was not best practice. Â  If email address sharing was enabled, it was possible to have a duplicate contact record sharing first_name, last_name, email, and login. Â  Upon upgrading to November 2012 or later, these contacts must be either merged, deleted, or modify Â one field to be unique. This change was made in effort to handle functionality for workflows used in the dynamic agent desktop environments.

Incident or answer shows as updated after staff account is edited;Answer ID 5850;Why does an answer show as updated afterÃ‚Â the staff account assigned to the answer is edited?;['Answer ID 2831']; Ã‚Â  November 2011 and newer releases;" If a staff account is moved to another account group, all of the answers assigned to that staff account will reflect an edit transaction. This occurs because each answer has a specific value assigned for the ""Assigned Group"" field. This value is separate from the ""Assigned Account"" field even though they are both displayed together under the ""Assigned"" field in the answer workspace. Therefore, you can change one and not the other. For example, an answer can be assigned to the group ""Authors"" and the staff account ""Jane Doe"". You can change the assigned staff account (Jane Doe) while keeping the assigned group (Authors) the same. This change would result in an edit transaction Â in the Audit Log of the Â answer. This will also be reflected in the Date Updated field of the answer. Â  If Jane Doe's staff account Â is moved to Â another Â group ""Disabled"", this does not change the value of the assigned staff account in the answer. However, because there is a hierarchical relationship between accounts and groups, the assigned group value changes for all answers which Â Jane Doe is Â assigned to. This also occurs for any incidents she is assigned to. The group change from ""Authors"" to ""Disabled"" Â is correctly logged as an edit transaction in the Audit Log and this reflects as an update in the answer or incident record."

Storage Space needed for Custom Deployment Options;Answer ID 5859;How much server storage space is needed for the Custom Deployment Options?;['Answer ID 2831'];   Releases November 2010 and later Oracle B2C Service;  The storage space need for the Custom Deployment Options varies depending on a number of factors including the deployment option being considered. Below are some guidelines to assist in determining the space requirements. For the Shared Network Location (SNL) and Custom Deployment Location (CDL): The initial installation of the application will require at least 300MB but will grow as Maintenance Packs are applied*. It is suggested that at least 1GB of storage be reserved for the CDL and SNL. For the User Files Location (UFL): With the initial login, each agent, with no add-ins, will use about 10 MB of storage. Depending on add-ins and file attachment, the space requirement for each agent can grow to 80 to 100 MB. As with the SNL and CDL, the space requirement will increase as Maintenance Packs are applied*. It is suggested that at least 500 MB of storage per agent be reserved for the Â Oracle B2C Service application. Notes:  - *The Oracle B2C Service application, by design, creates a new version folder numbered for each update or Maintenance Pack that is applied to a site. By design the application will keep the last Â four version folders. Including the current version folder 5 total version folders can be in the CDL location. - The above  Â information also applies to single use agents on a per workstation bases when the CDT and or UFL is not used. Expect the initial users folder to around 300 MB and the those can grow as noted above.

Using the Inherit property for task fields;Answer ID 5867;How does the 'Inherit' property work for task fields?;['Answer ID 2831'];   Workspaces / Opportunities / Tasks;"  When a task is associated with a record, some values for that task can be Ã¢â‚¬Å“inheritedÃ¢â‚¬Â from the associated record. For example, you might add a task and define it as an opportunity task by setting the Task Type field to Opportunities. Once you have selected the opportunity you want to associate with the task, you can choose to set the assigned staff member, organization, and contact for the task to the same ones that are associated with the opportunity. Then, if you should later change the opportunityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assigned staff member, organization, or contact, the same change will occur on the associated task. Understanding Task type: The concept of inheritance hinges on the task type. If you do not select an option from the Task Type drop-down menu, the task field values cannot be inherited from a record associated with the task. For instance, you can use the Inherit property to make the taskÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assigned staff member, organization, and contact the same as the opportunityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s values. If, however, you leave the task type unspecified, you cannot use the Inherit property for those fields. All of the task typesÃ¢â‚¬â€opportunities, organizations, contacts, incidents, answers, campaigns, mailings, surveys, and documentsÃ¢â‚¬â€allow the Assigned field to be inherited from the associated record. Use the Inherit property when you want the task to always be assigned to the staff member who is assigned to the record, even when the staff member assigned to the record changes. As another example, assume you set the Assigned field of a Mailings task to Inherit. If you change the staff member assigned to the mailing, the staff member assigned to the associated task also changes to the new staff member. If you want the task to always be assigned to the same person assigned to the mailing, even if that staff member changes, select Inherit. If, on the other hand, you want a particular staff member to be assigned to the mailing task, regardless of who is assigned to the actual mailing, do not use Inherit. If, on the other hand, you want a particular staff member to be assigned to the task, regardless of who is assigned to the actual record, do not use Inherit. Although the following procedures use the Answer task type as an example, the procedure is the same for all task types. NOTE: Once a Task is completed, the inherited value will no longer change if the opportunity assigned value changes. Â  Â However, you may need to Save &amp; Close and re-open the opportunity before you see this change in the inherited value."

The format of the Page Peek page is displayed improperly to chat agents;Answer ID 5872;Why is Page Peek not rendering the proper web page format within an open chat session?;['Answer ID 2831'];   November 2013 and newer versions using Engagement Engine Integration;"  If the Page Peek information displayed in a chat session does not match the look &amp; feel of the page where the chat was accepted, then you can add the following meta element to your site: &lt;meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=Edge, 10, 9""&gt; It is important to understand that browser versions may also impact the display of Page Peek information in the chat session, regardless of whether this meta element is in place. If the end-user and the agent are chatting on different browsers, the display of Page Peek information could be impacted. For example: If the end-user is using Firefox and the agent uses Internet Explorer, then the captured HTML may display differently for the agent than what the end-user sees on the webpage. The differences are dependent on the design of the website the end-user is visiting. Notes on the placement of the meta element:  This X-UA-Compatible header is not case sensitive This meta element must appear in the header of the webpage (the HEAD section) Additionally, it should be placed before all other elements, except for the title elements Placing the meta tag on the page more than once would result in ""required parameters missing"" errors.

Long-term and Short-term solved counts;Answer ID 5874;What determinesÃ‚Â long-term solved counts and short-term solved counts for answers?;['Answer ID 790', 'Answer ID 2816'];   Answers, Solved Count;  There are four fields in the answers table that account for solved count for end-user vs. admin and short-term vs. long-term activity. Â   solved_count Â  (this was the original field name, this field accounts for end-user, long-term solved count) eust_solved_count: ault_solved_count aust_solved_count  There are separate fields for enduser (eu) and admin (au) and for long-term(lt) and short-term (st). Activity on the admin / console side is represented by 'au'. There is also a configuration setting named SA_SHORT_TERM_AGE_FREQ which specifies the number of days in your short-term window for calculating answer popularity. Default is 7 days. You use the SA_SHORT_TERM_AGE_FREQ setting to specify short-term vs long-term (i.e. 7 days vs. more than 7 days) and then you can set the SA_SOLVED_WEIGH_PREF to be a weighting factor in specifying the overall solved count.  SA_SOLVED_WEIGH_PREF: Specifies the display preference of calculated solved counts. Supported values are: 1 - strong preference (95%) for long-term solved counts 2 - 75% preference for long-term solved counts 3 - even preference (50%) for both long- and short-term counts 4 - 75% preference for short-term solved counts 5 - strong preference (95%) for short-term solved counts Default is 2.  For example, you could specify your short-term period as 30 days by editing SA_SHORT_TERM_AGE_FREQ and setting to 30 and then if you wanted to heavily favor the short-term solved counts from the last month, you would set SA_SOLVED_WEIGH_PREF to a 4 or 5.

Custom Error Pages not being invoked at the Customer Portal;Answer ID 5879;If an end-user gets a 404 error, can we customize what is displayed to them?;['Answer ID 6417'];   This answer applies to Customer Portal page sets;  There are two possible 404 Â error pages that may be displayed when a user attempts to load an invalid URL in Customer Portal. Which page is displayed to the user is dependent Â upon Â the Â URL Â path that the user has attempted to load. Â Both of these 404 error Â pages can be customized via WebDAV. Â  URLs in the /app directory: This applies to users who attempt to navigate to non-existing pages within the /app directory, for example http://mysite.custhelp.com/app/fakepage. The error message displayed to these users can be customized by editing the error404.php file found via WebDAV at the following location: Customer Portal Framework Version 3.x: /cp/customer/development/views/pages/error404.php Customer Portal Framework Version 2: /euf/development/views/pages/error404.php This page may be edited and uploaded via WebDAV. As with other Customer Portal pages, It must be staged and promoted to production before it will be available to your end users Â in the production environment. URLs outside of the /app directory: This applies to users who attempt to navigate to non-existing pages outside of the /app directory, for example http://mysite.custhelp.com/fakepage. Although this URL is technically on your end user pages, it is outside of the Customer Portal framework and thus a different process must be followed to customize the 404 error page. The error message displayed to these users can be customized by editing the error404.php file found via WebDAV at the following location: Customer Portal Framework Version 3.x: /cp/customer/error/error404.html Customer Portal Framework Version 2: /euf/config/error404.html This page is editable and may be accessed/uploaded via WebDAV. Note that changes to this page take effect in your production environment immediately, as this page exists outside of the Customer Portal framework. Â There is no stage/deployment process for this page. Note: Error pages can't use template or widgets or any other rn: type tags on them. These are more like code snippets that are included when a PHP error is encountered. So, if you have some code on the page that is runtime-invalid PHP, we'll include the error_php.php file to display the error. You can use PHP on them, but we don't parse them for CP tags.

Cobrowse does not work in the agent's workspace;Answer ID 5884;"Why does Cobrowse show a message of ""Waiting for the customer to start co-browsing..."" even after the customer has clicked to allow screen sharing?";['Answer ID 6417'];   Integrated Cobrowse, Chat  Issue   Frequently Cobrowse does not connect properly when agents send invitations to start a Cobrowse session.Ã‚Â  Even though the end-user clicks 'Allow' within the chat window the agent's Cobrowse screen is stuck indicating that it is waiting for the customer to start.  The agent might see 'Customer accepted the desktop screen-sharing invitation. Please wait while the session is started...'.Ã‚Â  The end-user might see 'Initializing and connecting screen-sharing session...'.;  Add the utils/CobrowsePremium widget to your Customer Portal pages. Â  Adding this to the standard.php template is a simple way to add the widget to all customer portal pages that utilize that Â template. Oracle Cobrowse will typically launch in ICB (Instant Cobrowse) mode. ICB mode requires that a web page be open which has the Â Cobrowse launcher script. Â Only web site content tagged with the Cobrowse launcher script can be viewed by the agent when Cobrowsing in ICB mode. Â  This is Â typically accomplished by placing the Cobrowse launcher script in the global header of a company's web site. Â  This can also be done within Customer Portal by Â adding Â the utils/CobrowsePremium widget to the standard template. NOTE: The chat/ChatCobrowsePremium widget on the chat_landing.php page Â alone is not sufficient to add the cobrowse launcher script. The recommended configuration is:  chat/ChatCobrowsePremium - should be used on the chat/chat_landing.php page utils/CobrowsePremium - should be used in the templates/standard.php  Additionally, if the chat_landing.php page opens in the same tab as the chat_launch.php page, the end-user will need to have a separate page open which has the launch script in order to Cobrowse with the agent.

Cobrowse: End user does not see session ended message right away;Answer ID 5899;Why don't endusers see a 'session ended' message right away once agent disconnects?;['Answer ID 412', 'Answer ID 2305'];  Cobrowse; When Cobrowse is used from the answer page it is used in conjunction with a phone call. Â  Â There are some cases where business cases may necessitate the transferring of that phone call to a new agent. Â  Â The initial agent will be able to disconnect from Cobrowse and transfer the call then the second agent can connect with the customer using the same session. When the agent disconnects the customer window will show the session as active for approximately 2 and half minutes. Â  Â If a new agent does not connect to the session before that time they are informed that the session has ended.

Dataminer aggregation of knowledge foundation tables;Answer ID 5922;How is the data in the Knowledge Foundation tables aggregated?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 5922'];  All sites on the November 2011 version or more recent; The Â dataminer utility is responsible for aggregating the data from the 'clickstreams' tables into the Â Knowledge Foundation tables. Â  The data is aggregated on a per interface bases depending on the type of activity performed during a given time interval. It is important to note that Dataminer runs on end-user data that is 4 hours old. Therefore, the newest end-user statistics that are available are 4 hours old. Hourly (window = 0): Initially, dataminer rolls the data into Â one hour intervals. Â  This roll-up happens at the end of the next hour that dataminer executes meaning the Xth hour will be processed during the first dataminer run after the clock strikes X+1. Â  For example, the data from the 12:00:00 to 13:00:00 hour will be rolled into the 12:00:00 hour the next time dataminer runs after the clock hits 13:00:00. Â  Daily (window = 1): The daily roll-up occurs when dataminer runs at the end of the next day. Â  Therefore, Â the data for 08/12/16 will roll into a Â daily window Â during one of the dataminer runs at the Â end of the day on 08/13/16 or the beginning of the day on 08/14/16. Â   Â  Monthly (window = 2): The monthly roll-up occurs when dataminer runs at the end of the next month meaning the data for July 2016 will roll into a monthly window Â during one of the dataminer runs the last day of August 2016 or the first day of September 2016. Â  Yearly (window = 3): The yearly roll-up occurs when dataminer runs at the end of the next year. Â  Thus, the data for 2015 will not roll into a yearly window until dataminer runs on 12/31/16 or 01/01/17.

What happens to incident assignment during a chat transfer?;Answer ID 5926;What happens to incident assignment during a chat transfer?;['Answer ID 5922'];  Chat,Ã‚Â Incidents, Workspaces;" In the February 2012 version new functionality was added.

Oracle B2C Service Mail Files deprecation begins August 19, 2013;Answer ID 5965;What do I need to know about the Oracle B2C Service Mail Files deprecation?;['Answer ID 5380', 'Answer ID 5380'];   PHP Mail Files;  UPDATE: Â File Manager Mail Files (also referred to as Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Mail ScriptsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) will become unavailable beginning with Oracle B2C Service 19D. Per the deprecation notice below, these files will continue to be read-only until that point. Upon upgrading to 19D+ message templates will be automatically enabled. Customers are encouraged to complete their migration to Message Templates prior to the feature removal.  How long will I have to move away from mail files?  Oracle B2C Service is announcing the deprecation of mail files. Clients who have customized their mail files can continue to use these files for at least two years from this depreciation announcement. A specific removal date will be added to this notice when removal is scheduled to occur. Until this feature removal date, the mail files will continue to display as read-only so that customers can copy any existing message content into the system-generated notifications and emails, which are now defined by the Message Templates. This announcement supports the evolution of all contact emails, administrator notifications, and administrator emails to a standard Message Templates designer that allows backward compatibility and seamless updates. Message Templates provide the ability to customize your message content, including headers and footers, instead of making changes to multiple PHP files. Learn more about Message Templates here. All new sites created on version November 2012 or later will automatically have Message Templates enabled. All sites updated to versions released on or after November 2012 will not be able to make any additional customizations to their existing mail files or create new mail files. Â  Â   Actions Required for Existing Sites   Existing customers without any mail file customizations should consider moving to Message Templates. Simply modify the global template as needed, deploy your Message Templates and enable the MESSAGE_TEMPLATES_ENABLED configuration setting for your site. Existing customers with mail file customizations should evaluate if those customizations are still necessary, and work to apply similar changes using the Message Templates editor. Customers should target a completion date for this effort no later than the feature removal date.  If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager or contact your Sales Account Manager.  Why are the PHP mail files being deprecated?  To fulfill our commitment to backward compatibility and seamless updates, Oracle B2C Service is providing a standard product area called Message Templates, which allows for full configuration of service email messages and notifications.  What is the available alternative to mail files?  Previously, customizing the PHP mail files required a developer or Professional Services to complete customizations. Message Templates, the replacement functionality for mail files, provides a graphical user interface leveraging similar features found in Oracle B2C Service Outreach. This creates a system where any administrator can customize mail messages and configure a more update-stable mail message. Additionally, Message Templates are much more flexible than using configuration settings that provide an all-or-nothing experience, such as suppressing custom fields from all messages. Learn more about Message Templates here. Questions should be directed to your Account Manager or contact your Sales Account Manager.

What is deprecation? Oracle Â Service Cloud Â defines Ã¢â‚¬ËœdeprecationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as Â a status Â where a technology or feature is being Â phased out of the product and its use is discouraged, often to allow an improved technology or feature to take its place. Â  Â The deprecation time period, typically 2 years (although extensions may be applied to specific product technologies/features), is the period from announced deprecation to removal of the feature from the product. Â  Â  What happens during deprecation? During the deprecation period, the deprecated technology/feature is not available for purchase or new implementations. The deprecated item is not enhanced or changed during the period; support and documentation may be limited. Â  Â One or more replacement technologies/features are typically made available at the start of or during the deprecation period. The deprecation period is the best opportunity for sites to migrate off Â of the deprecated functionality to new or replacement functionality. Â  Â  How do I know if a deprecation is relevant to my site? Site administrators should review relevant notices for all in-process and completed deprecations based upon the current release of their production site. Â  Â Information about migration and replacement technology/feature is provided in a related answer where available. Â  Â Additional information about migration is available in the Upgrade Guides.  Â These are available in the Documentation Overview answers for each version. In-Progress Deprecations These features are within the 2-year deprecation period and will be removed in a future release.

Response cannot be sent, incident does not have a mailbox selected. Select a mailbox and try again.;Answer ID 5977;Why are we receiving a 'response cannot be sent' error when trying to send a response?;['Answer ID 331'];   Mailboxes / Service - Outgoing Emails  Issue   When trying to send an incident response message, agents are seeing the following error:   The response cannot be sent since the incident does not have a mailbox selected. Select a mailbox and try again.  Note: In February 2015 and older, the specific error text was slightly different: No valid CSS mailboxes associated with the interface for this incident.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Send aborted.   We have recently moved a mailbox from one interface and re-configured it on another.Ã‚Â  Could this have had an impact?;  There are two options for resolving this issue: 1. Â For the interface the incident is associated with, ensure that interface has a default Service Mailbox.  If there are no mailboxes configured on the interface the incident is associated to, outgoing messages cannot be sent from that interface. If you are receiving this error within your production or upgrade site, Â use these steps to set a default mailbox:  - Open each of the mailboxes within each interface. Â  Â You will likely be prompted with messaging similar to the following: --------------------------- The Outgoing Email checkbox has been set to true. Â  Â During the upgrade process, the outgoing email property gets set to false. Â  Â Please save the record to set the outgoing property. --------------------------- - Confirm configurations are correct and that each interface has a default mailbox designated and hit Save. Â  Â  - Create a new incident and send a response associated to the respective interface to test results.    2. Ensure the incident throwing the error has a mailbox and interface association where a default service mailbox is configured.  Another scenario is where a mailbox is moved from Â one interface and re-configured in another. Mailboxes are specific to the interface they are configured in. Â  When a mailbox is 'moved' to a new interface, the mailbox ID at the database level changes. However, the interface/mailbox ID associations of existing incidents does not automatically change. Therefore, Â existing incidents will no longer have a valid association to an interface Â and mailbox. That association will need to be updated within the incident throwing the error. Â  Â  From a standard incident workspace, both the Mailbox and Interface fields are available from the Details tab. Â  Â Once a valid association is made (i.e. either to a new mailbox or to an interface with a default mailbox enabled for outgoing messages), a response can be sent. Once the incident is saved with the correct associations, Â a response email can Â be sent without error. Â   For more information on mailbox configuration, refer to Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service.

Debugging formatting issues on the CP pages;Answer ID 5978;How do I debug the look and feel (CSS)Ã‚Â of the end user pages?;['Answer ID 331'];   All end user pages using Customer Portal;"  End user page formatting is controlled by page Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) files. Â  The development (editable) Â version of CSS files are in the directory of the template that you are using. Â  Usually the main file is ""/assets/themes/standard/site.css"". Â  Â  End user page look at feel issues can be easily debugged with a web development tool such as the Firebug plugin for Firefox. Â  https://getfirebug.com/ Â  Note that there are also CSS debuggers available for other browsers such as Chrome. Â  If you have a browser specific problem you may have to use a tool in a different browser. Â  Note that although the instructions below are for Firebug, there is equivalent functionality in other tools. 1. Before proceeding install the latest version of Firefox and the Firebug plugin. Â  Refer to the documentation of Firebug to find how to enable Â and use the plugin. 2. Â  In Firefox with Firebug enabled, select the text with incorrect formatting, right click and select Inspect Element with Firebug. 3. The firebug console will appear with the HTML of the selection highlighted, a list of the CSS tags and the files that they reside. The files are usually contained in the ""/assets/themes/&lt;theme name&gt;/"" folder. 4. Note the file that the CSS tags is contained and make changes to that file. Note that you can click on a CSS file name and make changes directly to the CSS in Firebug for troubleshooting. However, these changes are not stored in the CSS files and are therefore temporary. Please note that Technical Support does not assist with CSS customization questions. Â  If you need further assistance with CSS customization please refer to the Oracle Cloud Customer Connect Community, Â or you can work with Oracle Consulting Services. Cause: Often times there are many formatting tags from different files applied to one piece of text. For help with CSS please refer to a CSS reference such as http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/."

Â  Â There were other issues with the display of the various typefaces and other options available for text display, and adding this space corrected those problems, and therefore, it was intentionally made part of the product. Â  Â  An alternative to this is to manually remove the spacing from the response thread prior to sending.

Staff Account randomly getting locked;Answer ID 6025;Why does my account keep getting locked?;['Answer ID 31'];  Staff Accounts Oracle B2C Service, All versions; When a staff account becomes locked, it is usually due to the staff member attempting to log in with the incorrect password. After a specified number of attempts, the account will be locked by the system. By default, the user has five attempts to log in. After that, the account will be locked. However, if you have mapped a WebDav connection to a network drive on your workstation to your Customer Portal pages, Windows will attempt to make a WebDav connection to this network drive every time your workstation boots up. If you have recently reset your staff account password without changing it within the network drive's configuration settings, then each time the workstation boots up, it will make failed login attempt. To resolve this, please make sure that if you do reset your staff account password, you also update the password in your network drive settings. Or consider utilizing a different WebDav client such as Cyberduck (http://cyberduck.ch) which does not automatically attempt to connect to the network drive upon start up.

Redirect your page using PHP;Answer ID 6049;"How do I redirect my &lt;whatever page&gt; to &lt;whatever page&gt;?";['Answer ID 325'];  Customer Portal Pages;"  Â  PHP is an easy and fast way to redirect your pages both permanently and temporarily. When making a PHP redirect you need to make sure that you are putting the PHP code before the HTML tag including empty rows and spaces. Â  Â So for example:  &lt;HTML&gt; Â  Â &lt;- this is wrong &lt;?php header(""HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently""); header(""Location: https://&lt;www.yourSiteHere.com&gt;"");exit; ?&gt; &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;- This is correct  The correct syntax is:  header ( string $string [, bool $replace = true [, int $http_response_code ]] ) So, in the int $http_response_code you could also use Â the 302 temporary redirect. Another example using all the parameters on the same line would be: &lt;?php header(""Location: https://&lt;www.yourSiteHere.com&gt;"", true, 301); exit; ?&gt; Here is a link to the redirect manual page: http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php  Notes: If you don't use the 301 line then your viewer will see a ""Moved Temporarily"" redirect instead of a 301. Â  Â While this is not detrimental it is good coding practice and is more search engine friendly. (also note the "" "" not the ' ' ticks). References: Here is a link to the redirect manual page: http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php The PHP home page can be found here. Â  It will provide free and comprehensive documentation. http://php.net/  Â   "

Test cases in Intelligent Advisor;Answer ID 6058;WhatÃ‚Â are test casesÃ‚Â in Intelligent Advisor?;['Answer ID 325'];   Intelligent Advisor, latestÃ‚Â release;  For the long term maintainability of rules, test cases should always be created whenever rules are developed. Test cases can immediately confirm that all rules are giving expected outcomes, and tell you if any rule change has had any inadvertent side effects. Test cases are collected into testing documents, and can be executed as often as needed. If needed, hundreds or even thousands of test cases can be managed in a single project. Test cases specify the data that would be loaded at the start or entered during the interview and expected outcomes. Test cases can be used with sample data (contained in a test data connector file) that specifies the data that would be dynamically loaded during an interview. Testing documents can also be useful for what-if analysis, allowing a policy author to see how policy changes affect outcomes. Test cases are defined in Microsoft Excel and managed in Policy Modeling. This enables you to:  Easily create variations on test cases Share common data across multiple test cases See differences between actual and expected results Keep test results from previous policy versions Use standard Excel features to chart and analyze results   Â  For more information on performing policy testing, see:  Create, update or delete a testing document Create a test case Run test cases Debug a failing test case  Â  See also:  Plan and manage a policy modeling project

Explains when an incident is created during a chat session;Answer ID 6084;When is an incident created during a chat session?;['Answer ID 4189', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Chat - Agent Console, Workspaces;  Beginning in the November 2010 release and the introduction of Flexible Incident Editing, incidents created from chat will always contain the full chat transcript. Â  Â Administrators control if, when, and how an incident is created. Â  Â This is done via the Options button on the chat workspace designer. For additional information on available chat workspace Options, refer to Answer ID 4189: Chat Flexible Incident Editing. During a chat session, a 'placeholder' incident is created. The incident record exists only within the agent console at this point. Â  Â This 'placeholder' incident is created either at the beginning or end of a chat session, depending on the workspace options set. Once the chat session concludes or a Save action is done on the incident, this is when the incident record is written to the database (i.e. i_id is written to the chats and incidents table). As an example, let's say the workspace is set to 'create an incident at the beginning of a chat session'. While in a chat session, the agent will see the Incident field populated with a reference number. Â  Â If the workspace is set to 'create an incident at the end of the session', the Incident field will show no value. Â  Â However, it is only upon completing the chat session or the agent saving the incident that it is actually written to the database (i.e. record details saved in the incidents table). NOTE: Â This is the only way an incident can be associated with a chat in the 'chats' table at the database level. Once chat has terminated, an incident can no longer be associated with that particular chat. There is, however, an option in the 'All Chats' report(ID 3017) to right-click a certain record and select Add - Add to New Incident which will create a new incident and insert the chat transcript into the incident note. What this does at the database level is link the chat to the contact that initiated it. It is also possible for the workspace to be configured to not create an incident from a chat session. Within the workspace options, if 'No' is selected for both the 'create at beginning' and 'create at end' options, then no incident will be created upon completion of a chat session. For more information, refer to the 'Creating incidents from chat sessions' section in the online documentation for your version.

Appending information during Ask A Question submit;Answer ID 6090;What options are there to append information during the Ask a Question process from the end-user pages?;['Answer ID 4189', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Ask a Question (AAQ), SmartAssistant (SA), Appending SA via Business Rules Oracle B2C Service;"  There are two options for appending content / suggesting solutions using business rules. 1. Append SmartAssistant suggestions using system-defined format  Rule action is: Append SmartAssistant Response to Response field  2. Create a standard response and append the standard response (customized text - may or may not include the $solutions variable)  Rule actions are: Append Response Template to Response Field Append Response Template to Notes Field (only applies if source is Ask a Question) Append Response to uncommitted response buffer Â - content is editable and not saved in an auto-reply thread type.  Incident Sources: The incident source determines whether the content is presented during the AAQ submittal or if the content is appended to the incident thread when viewed from the console.  SmartAssistant on Ask a Question: The incident source ""SmartAssistant on Ask a Question"" ONLY deals with displaying content to the user during the submittal process. With this source in the rule, nothing gets appended to the actual incident when viewed from the admin console. With a standard response, the content in the HTML field is always used in the pop-up. Ask a Question:The incident source ""Ask a Question"" ONLY deals with content appended to the actual thread of the incident. This source has NO impact on displaying content to the user during the submittal process. With a standard response, the content that is appended depends on whether visual email is used or not. If visual email is used, the content of the HTML field is appended. If visual email is not used, the content of the TEXT field is appended.  As a result, if you only want to display something during the submittal process, the incident source for the rule should only have SmartAssistant on Ask a Question selected and should not have Ask a Question enabled as a source. SCENARIO 1: APPENDING SMARTASSISTANT SUGGESTIONS (without custom messaging)  Â  Case 1: Displays SmartAssistant (SA) solutions to popup dialog but does not append to response field of incident. Use single incident source (SA on AAQ).  Â  IF Incident source = SmartAssistant on Ask a Question (only one option checked) THEN Append SmartAssistant to Response Field  Â   Â  Case 2: Displays SA solutions as links to popup dialog and append SA suggestions as auto-reply thread. Auto-reply is sent with receipt message since it is committed to the thread. Source is both SA on AAQ and AAQ.  Â  IF Incident source = SmartAssistant on Ask a Question AND Ask a Question (both options checked) THEN Append SmartAssistant to Response Field  Â   Â  Case 3: Displays SA solution links to popup dialog and appends SA suggestions to response field of incident in an auto-reply thread. Source is both SA on AAQ and AAQ. Includes uncommitted response buffer action. Content is appended to Response field but since it is not committed; it is not sent with receipt message AND the content can be edited or deleted when the incident is opened from the admin console.  Â  IF Incident source = SmartAssistant on Ask a Question AND Ask a Question (both options checked) THEN Append SmartAssistant to Response Field Append response to uncommitted response buffer  Â  SCENARIO 2: APPENDING CUSTOM MESSAGE USING STANDARD RESPONSE (may or may not use $solutions variable)  Â  Case 1: Displays standard response to popup dialog but does not append to response field of incident. Use single incident source (SA on AAQ).  Â  IF Incident source = SmartAssistant on Ask a Question (only one option checked) THEN Append Response Template to Response Field (rule may or may not have Append response to uncommitted response buffer - has no effect)  Â   Â  Case 2: Displays response to popup dialog AND appends text content to an auto-response thread in the incident. Auto-response cannot be edited or deleted. Auto-response gets sent as part of receipt message.  Â  IF Incident source = SmartAssistant on Ask a Question AND Ask a Question (both options checked) THEN Append Response Template to Response Field  Â   Â   Â  Case 3: Displays response to popup dialog AND appends text content to response field of incident. Response content can be edited or deleted. Uncommitted content is not sent in receipt message.

Test Site Performance;Answer ID 6092;Why does our test site perform slower than our production site?;['Answer ID 4189', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Non-Production sites (test sites and upgrade UAT sites); Test sites are hosted on cloned servers, separated from production sites. Â  Â This prevents issues in test environments impacting production sites. Â  Â Because test sites are on cloned servers, the same performance levels are not guaranteed. Â  Â While our Technical Support and Cloud Operations teams will still work to determine root cause and take steps to resolve any performance issues unique to a cloned or test, it is possible for a production site to run at a higher performance level than a test site. If you have questions or concerns regarding test site performance please create an SR. Â  Â If Technical Support verifies that performance differences are related to degradation in clone server performance our Cloud Operations team will take action to remediate the problem. Â  Â Please note that Cloud Operations prioritizes production server maintenance over clone server maintenance.

Searching for a contact with an underscore in the email address causes query processes too much data error;Answer ID 6094;When trying to search for a contact containing an email with an underscore character, why are we receiving a query processes too much data error?;['Answer ID 4278', 'Answer ID 2509'];   Oracle B2C Service, Analytics, All versions;  In SQL, the underscore character is treated as a wildcard character, similar to the % symbol. If the report you are using contains a filter based on contacts.email and using the LIKE operator, searching for a contact Â that contains an underscore in the email will treat the underscore as a wild card. For example, searching for Â a_test@emailaddress.com, will search for all occurrences of: aatest@emailaddress.com abtest@emailaddress.com actest@emailaddress.com adtest@emailaddress.com and so on. Because of the wildcard character, more rows will need to be processed when performing this search and you may receive the query processes too much data error. Please see the following answer for additional information about this error, Answer 4278: Report is processing too much data. To prevent this from happening, you can use the backslash escape character in your search so that the underscore character will be treated literally and not as a wildcard. For example: a\_test@emailaddress.com Or you can edit the report's contacts.email filter to use the EQUALS operator instead of the LIKE operator. Please see the following answer on how to edit report filters: Answer 2509: Creating a basic custom report

Why?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Profiles / Analytics Oracle B2C Service;"  This option Â allows a user to print, export, and forward reports. Â  Â This is different than having the ability to print, export, and forward records (i.e. incidents and contacts). Â  Â For example, let's say an agent opens an incident and goes to the Â Contacts tab and views the Incident History sub-tab. Â  Â The options available (i.e. Open, Add New, Print, Delete, Forward, etc) that appear are in reference to the agent's ability to perform these actions on records within the report being displayed (i.e. incident records). However, from this same sub-tab, if you select the ""Options"" menu from the far right, these are the permissions associated with the overall report. Â  Â Therefore, if the profile does not allow an agent to print, Â forward or export, those options will not appear under the ""report Options"" menu. If you do wish to remove the record command options, one option you can do is Â to edit Â the custom report used in a workspace. (Note: Â Standard reports cannot be modified and will need to be replaced with custom reports if you wish to implement this option.) Â  Â With the report open for editing, select Home &gt; Records.

For example, details such as the name and email displayed in the top session summary area are pulled from the incoming chat request. Â  Â The name displayed within the resulting chat transcript is also passed in with the incoming chat request. However, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ContactÃ¢â‚¬Â search field in the top summary panel is pulled from the associated contact record. Â  Â If the contact record does not have a first or last name value, the chat agent will see [Name not specified]. Â  Â  Â  Â  The system defined contact name variables also pull from the associated contact record. Â  Â Here again, if the associated contact record has no first or last name values, the system defined variables of contacts.name.first and contacts.name.last will not render. Â  Â  To help agents avoid this on an incoming chat, if they see [Name not specified] in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ContactÃ¢â‚¬Â search field, they can edit the contact record and save name values while in a chat session. Â  Â Then, when they append the standard text message, the variables will render with the correct values they entered from the contact record.

An end-user requests a chat 2. The chat is offered to an agent 3. Before the agent can accept, the end-user cancels the request If you wish to modify the messaging of this alert, you can do so by editing the message base.  Â   The relevant .NET Agent Desktop message base is NEWLY_ASSIGN_CHAT_SESS_RE_TERM_MSG, with default value: ""The newly assigned chat session has been reassigned or terminated by the end-user.""  Â   Â  The relevant Browser User Interface (BUI) Agent Web message base is ENGAGEMENT_IS_NO_LONGER_AVAILABLE_MSG with default value: ""Engagement is no longer available. This may be due to the visitor choosing to leave the queue.""  When this happens, there are a couple of standard reports you can use to review the events of incoming requests.  Â  Â  1.

Using Custom Objects in business rules;Answer ID 6120;Are Custom Objects supported in business rules?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Custom Business Objects Oracle B2C Service;  In the August 2017 release, changes were made to allow for the use of the Business Rules 2.0 engine within the Browser User Interface (BUI). Please note Business Rules 2.0 is not available within the .NET console. For more information on business rules for BUI, please see our documentation located here. Customers not using BUI can utilize the Process Designer / Custom Process Models (CPM) feature that allows associating PHP scripts with object events. Â  Â Business logic can be migrated to PHP code, so effectively business rules can be performed on Custom Objects. Customers not planning on using BUI for agents may need to make use of BUI for Administration purposes for things like Business Rules 2.0 and Custom Process Logging.

Task merge fields on message templates are populating with 'No Value';Answer ID 6136;Why are the merge fields I am using in my Task Message Templates not populating with the correct values?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Merge Fields in Message Templates November 2012 and newer; If you find that your Organization, Contact, Opportunity and Incident Merge fields are not populating Â with the correct values when your administration email message templates are sent, you may wish to review the Tasks from which these messages are being sent to ensure that each of the expected fields is populated with a value on the task record. If a Task's Incident field is populated with a reference number, it does not necessarily follow that the Organization and Contact fields will also be populated with the administration email (such as Task Information or Task Forward) is sent. The Contact and the Organization will not be taken from the associated Incident. A single Task could be associated to numerous different records, including Organizations, Contacts, Opportunities etc. A Task's Organization could be entirely different from the Organization of the related Contact or Incident's Contact, for example. It could be set to a' Completed' status Â as it related to Â its Incident, but still be in progress as it related to Â its Contact. For this reason a Task is associated with each object separately. Rather than drawing the Organization and Contact data from the Incident, it looks for the Organization and Contact fields on the Task itself to be populated. If you find that your merge fields are populating with 'No Value' when administration emails are sent, ensure that the fields in question are on your Task workspace and are being populated with values. Those merge fields will not be populated with values from other related records.

Migration from Mail Scripts to Message Templates;Answer ID 6143;How do we migrate from Mail Scripts to Message Templates?;['Answer ID 5965', 'Answer ID 6409', 'Answer ID 5380', 'Answer ID 5489', 'Answer ID 2419'];   Mail Scripts, Message Templates;"  Message Templates provide an easy, flexible way to customize your outgoing Service emails and notifications, as well as personalize the Service messages for your Oracle B2C Service instance. Message Templates also offer patent-pending tracking capabilities, so that you can report on the actions for incident-related responses, such as views and clicks back to Customer Portal. This feature replaces the deprecated Mail Scripts capability (Oracle B2C Service Mail Files deprecation begins August 19, 2013), so migration is required before removal of Mail Scripts occurs at a future date. If you started using the product on/after November 2012 release, Message Templates is enabled by default. Upgrading from releases prior to this version will require migration and a sample list of migration steps is included below. Migration can occur at any point, and should be decoupled from any update. This migration is also one of the keys to entry for the Auto Update Program. If you have not customized your Mail Scripts, this migration should be simple and you are encouraged to try the default templates before making changes that were in play from the Â legacy configuration. Additionally, you may configure your Message Templates prior to enabling this feature, and convert one interface at a time if preferred. In this way, the messages can be set and reviewed before you send them to customers. There is a default Message Template already created for every message that was available in Mail Scripts, and new Message Templates have been added to provide more flexibility in your site configuration. This also makes it easier to understand the full list of the messages or notifications that are in use. Unlike Mail Scripts, the Message Templates do not rely on duplicated Message Bases or shared PHP files. Now you configure each message uniquely, adding any text or merge fields to one message at a time.  Suggested Migration Steps  The Update Guide includes steps for migrating to Message Templates (see Notifications and email messages under Common update enhancements). Reminder: You can first edit, preview/proof, and deploy these new messages prior to enabling them for customers! In addition to this resource, here are a few additional suggestions for your migration.  Add Message Templates permission to your Profile. This permission is within the Administration tab of the Profile Permissions. Add Message Templates to your navigation set (see Customizing notifications and email messages sent by Oracle B2C Service). Open the Message Templates editor to view the list of default messages available. Select an interface from the left navigation, and use the ribbon buttons for Admin Notifications, Admin Emails, Contact Emails, and Print Templates* to see all messages. Start by reviewing the Contact Emails, followed by Print Templates, and then forward messages within Admin Emails - those are typically the most frequently used in the product. View Send and HTML settings for your previous Mail Scripts messages by accessing Site Configuration &gt; Interfaces, and using the ribbon buttons of Admin Notifications, Admin Emails, Contact Emails.   Note which values are unchecked under the Send column. Those messages are not being sent when Mail Scripts are in use. Consider carefully if the same should apply as you move to Message Templates, and if so, uncheck the same Send checkbox(es) in the Message Templates editor, then Save.  Complete the same for the HTML column. If HTML is not selected, then only the Text version of the message is sent. Because of the style changes already applied to the default templates, and the ability to easily re-style the messages to meet your needs, you might consider keeping HTML selected for all Message Templates. If an HTML message cannot be viewed by a receiving email client, the Text version will be shown.   Update your Global Template, if desired, with your company logo or any relevant links or other company information. The Global Template is interface-specific, and is essentially a wrapper for your outgoing messages, giving them a consistent style and content. Don't forget to Save and use Deploy Template and Save using the ribbon buttons. If preferred, you can turn off the Global Template on a per-message basis. To view the source of your Mail Scripts message wrapper, please access Site Configuration &gt; File Manager &gt; mail files &gt; cci, and locate the header and footer files - the source differs for HTML and Text, so be sure to view both, as well as the differences between interfaces. Check the following config settings and make sure you update the applicable incident messages in Message Templates if needed:   MAIL_DETAILS_ENABLED: This config controls whether or not general incident information is available in your outgoing service message when Mail Scripts were in use. The details included in the default Message Templates are minimal and simple. You can further configure the email experience for your business using Merge Fields or Conditional or Case sections with Merge Fields included. The goal is to only show the customers what they absolutely need to see in the email response. Keep it simple, but add relevant fields as needed.  MAIL_SUPPRESS_NULL_CUST_FLDS: This config suppresses null value custom fields from the Mail Scripts. Similar to above, define what is critical for your customers to receive in their email, and add Merge Fields (standard or custom) in order to give them the correct information. If no Default value is listed for a Merge Field, and the value of the field is null (blank), then this field is not shown in the message. Alternately, pairing with Conditional and Case sections provides flexibility to display different fields based on context for each message. For example: Use a conditional section to show the 3 custom fields relating to one special product line that you manage. In this way, these fields are only viewable when they are important.  MAIL_INC_THREAD_LEN: This config controls the number of threads to be included in a message sent by Mail Scripts. To change the same value in a Message Template, modify the Incident Thread control properties in the applicable Message Templates to set this value smaller, if desired. By default, this control is used in the Incident messages (Incident Solved/Unresolved/Waiting/Closed, and Rule Email), and can be added to other messages. Change the Limit Threads value in the properties to meet your needs. See Â Answer ID 5489: Message Templates and MAIL_INC_THREAD_LEN for details. As an added bonus to Message Templates, you can also easily determine WHICH thread types should be included in the outgoing message, and send only those that you specify. Simply check the boxes next to each thread type to include them in your message.  MAIL_DEFINED_SUBJECT_ENABLED: This config supports always using one static subject for nearly every incident message sent via Mail Scripts. In Message Templates, starting in November 2013, you can configure your own subject lines for each message in a distinct manner. This provides a much more powerful way to configure your subjects using appropriate merge fields. Further enhancements added in the November 2014 release provide the ability to configure conditional subjects (up to 10 plus a default per message), so that you can change the subjects easily for different cases. For example: A VIP customer gets a personalized subject and response period, while a customer who emails you about an unsupported product gets a subject that says as much, while every other situation gets the standard subject (merge in Incident refno and Subject).   There Â are a number of Message Bases that made up the text in the Mail Scripts messages. Message Templates start with fresh content, so review the messages with fresh eyes to determine if changes are really necessary, according to your current business needs. See the attached file to view the list of Message Bases and their related mail script. You can also do a ""KEY"" field search on *HTML_MSG and *TXT_MSG to get started. The HTML strings applied when an HTML message was sent, and TXT strings applied to the text version.  As a note, if you have an update in-flight, talk to your Technical Migration Manager about whether or not you have customizations in any of the mail scripts files. These files live in the File Manager &gt; mail files area as read-only in any version on or after November 2012. If no changes exist, proceeding is EASY! :) You need not complete the migration at the same time as your update, but it provides the view you might need to understand if customizations are in play for your Mail Scripts.  Additional Checklist Items  Once you have reviewed your previous setup and applied the suggested changes, add other configuration to the messages to meet your business needs. Be sure to check the following:  Save your changes regularly. Changes are not fully committed until the Deploy option is used. Be sure to make frequent use of Preview and Proof capabilities. These allow you to view the messages with live record data, prior to deploying changes. Create the right messages for both HTML and Text versions of each email. Configure messages for all interfaces.   NOTE: You can enable Message Templates one interface at a time (see step 6), providing a great way to try the messages to a subset of your customers, in case you have concerns.   When the messages are prepared, be sure to deploy, then save Â your changes. These are not yet live to customers! Â  There is no harm in deploying during this phase as these aren't in effect until the configuration setting is changed. Â  The deploy simply promotes your edits into the Live version, which will be used once the config is enabled. Once you have deployed your changes, enable the configuration setting MESSAGE_TEMPLATES_ENABLED. This tells the system to send the Message Templates vs. the Mail Scripts.  IMPORTANT: Please note, once this functionality is enabled, you are unable to disable the functionality again. Once you enable message templates, the administrator notifications, administrator emails, and contact emails under Site Configuration &gt; Interfaces are disabled, but are still available as read-only, as stated in the online documentation.   Enter a value for EGW_DEFAULT_URL in case any links are broken in the future. See Answer 2419: With a Outreach campaign, users go to a blank page after clicking Submit Â for details.  *Separate Print Templates were added in the November 2013 release. Prior to this release the related Forward message template was also used for Print."

Understand what data can be mapped between Intelligent Advisor and Oracle B2C Service / CX data model;Answer ID 6163;What data can be mapped between a policy model in Intelligent Advisor and the Oracle B2C Service / CX data model?;['Answer ID 10378', 'Answer ID 1731'];    Intelligent Advisor, latest release Oracle B2C Service (OSvC, CX);  Intelligent Advisor interviews can load and save Oracle B2C Service data. To do this, Intelligent Advisor entities and attributes are mapped to corresponding Oracle B2C Service objects and fields. The following limitations apply to data mapping for Oracle B2C Service objects and fields. These restrictions are all enforced by Intelligent Advisor at project build time:  Interviews designed for anonymous users can only create data, not load or update data. This is because data can only be loaded for an authenticated user (Contact/Agent). At the global level, the list of available objects is limited: Â    for Contact interviews for input mapping, to objects which have a relationship to Contact. For more information, see Load data for Customer Portal users.  for Agent interviews, to objects which have CX workspaces where it is possible to embed the Intelligent Advisor control.For more information, see Load data for contact center agents.   A number of Service Cloud lists are supported by Intelligent Advisor.   Supported lists and menus will have value lists generated for them in Policy Modeling. When mapping Intelligent Advisor attributes to these list fields, they can only be mapped to Intelligent Advisor text attributes, and the list values are not editable by the interview designer.  Unsupported lists and menus (including all custom menus) can still be mapped for input and output, however, value lists arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t generated for them, so the designer has to ensure that the values submitted are valid by using their own value list or rule table to constrain the possible input values from the user, and to display items as helpful text rather than menu item IDs.  After making changes to supported lists in Service Cloud, ensure there is visibility for the updated items for the interface used, and refresh the data model in Policy Modeling to pull in changes to the associated value lists.   For interviews that are set up to create Service Cloud objects, all required fields must be output-mapped to Intelligent Advisor attributes. Fields that are required by Oracle B2C Service are indicated in the Output Mapping view in Policy Modeling by a red asterisk. Intelligent Advisor attributes can only be mapped to compatible Service Cloud fields. Generally, whether an object or field can be input-mapped, output-mapped or both is determined by the Service Cloud object model. Note: For more detailed information on the Service Cloud object model, see the section Object Model Introduction (opens in new window) in the Service Cloud documentation. There are some further limitations imposed by Intelligent Advisor:   Inferred entities can only be mapped for interviews that are set up to create Service Cloud objects, and none of the fields can be input-mapped.  Intelligent Advisor attributes with temporal values cannot be output-mapped.   There is no support for to-one relationships (for example, Organization of a Contact) While usage of Connect Web Services for SOAP is unlimited, there are practical limits which are enforced by the server. For more information, see API Limits(opens in new window).  See also:  Troubleshooting Service Cloud interviews Prerequisites for Intelligent Advisor with Oracle B2C Service

"""Fatal error; cannot connect to server"" at login screen";Answer ID 6164;"Why am I seeing a ""fatal error: cannot connect to server"" at the login screen of the Oracle RightNow console?";['Answer ID 1961'];  Oracle B2C Service, Login Window error; The BRAND_CONTENT_URL configuration setting allows you to customize the content pane of the login screen of the CX console. When this configuration is blank, the default behavior was to show a RightNow logo in this content pane which is hard coded into the product. Due to the de-commissioning of the rightnow.com domain, this hard coded URL is no longer valid. To resolve this issue, please edit the BRAND_CONTENT_URL configuration setting to contain a valid URL path Â to an Â image Â or page. Â Please see the Answer 1961: Customize the administration Login window Â for additional information on how to edit this configuration setting. Once the BRAND_CONTENT_URL configuration setting has been edited, a log out and log in may be required to allow the content pane to correctly display the updated contents.

Adding my own specific font to the list of available fonts for incidents;Answer ID 6165;Am I able to add my own specific font to the list of available fonts for incidents?;['Answer ID 1961'];   All Releases / Workspaces;  Â  It is not possible to add another font to the list of available fonts on the workspace editor, as there are no settings or options to set this list or to add new font files. It might be possible that our Oracle Consulting group can accomplish this Â with a customization that embeds the font file in the emails to ensure the end user had the font on their system when they opened the email, or to set a specific font as the default font in your emails via a bit of CSS in the Global Message Template. The CSS will override any font used by an agent in the 'Rich Text Incident Thread' editor.

Warning message received when saving incident workspace. Indicates responses will not be sent.;Answer ID 6169;Why do I receive a warning message when I attempt to save my Incident workspace?;['Answer ID 5488'];"  November 2012 and newer releases, Customers using Message Templates Issue  Agents receive the following message whenÃ‚Â they attempt to save within an Incident workspace:  ""This Workspace is using an Incident Thread control whose permissions are set to ""Allow using Send on Save."" However, the current interface does not allow you to send responses. This will result in a scenario where agents will be able to check ""Send on Save"" but a response will not be sent due to the settings in the interface. To avoid this confusion you can change the Incident Thread control's permissions so it will not allow Send on Save.  Are you sure you want to save this workspace?""";" There are three contact email message templates responsible for the messages which go to customers when your agents send responses from incident. These contact email message templates are as follows: Incident Solved: Sent to a contact when a staff member responds to the incident and the incident status type is ""solved"" Incident Waiting: Sent to a contact when a staff member responds to the incident and the incident status type is ""waiting"" Incident Unresolved: Sent to a contact when a staff member responds to the incident and the incident status type is ""unresolved"" If one or more of the above detailed messages are disabled on your interface, you will receive the warning message indicating the responses may not be sent from the workspace even though ""Send on Save"" is allowed. If, for example, the Incident Waiting message template is not enabled and an agent attempts to send a response from an incident in a waiting status, no response will go to the customer even though the ""Send on Save"" checkbox is checked. The warning message you receive is presented to advise you that their may be some conditions in which your agent believes that he or she has sent a response, but no response has gone out. If you do not want this to occur, you may wish to consider enabling your disabled contact email message templates.

Question Receipt and statuses;Answer ID 6179;How does the Status of an incident impact theÃ‚Â Question Receipt?;['Answer ID 5488'];  Rules, Outbound Email;" There are three different types of statuses that can be applied to an incident: Unresolved Waiting Solved Depending on the type of status that is applied to an incident Â it Â may Â impact the sending of the ""Question Receipt"". Â  Outlined below are two scenarios that highlight the difference of applying a different status type to an incident and if the Question Receipt is sent or not in each scenario.  Â  Scenario 1: Â  Â A ""Solved"" status is applied to an incident and and the Question Receipt is configured to be sent. Â  In this scenario the Question Receipt is NOT sent. Â  Here is an Â example Â rule Â for this scenario: THEN Set Status to: Â  Solved Send Receipt Email NOTE: Â  That when an incident hits the above rule (this can be verified in the rule log) the Question Receipt will Â NOT be sent and this may seem counter-intuitive due to the rule log. Â  However this scenario is functioning as designed as the Question Receipt will intentionally not be sent when an incident status is ""Solved"". If there is an intention to send a response to the customer via rules when an incident has a ""Solved"" status a rule can be configured to send a standard text. Â  Below is an exmaple rule that will accomplish this: THEN Set Status to: Â  Â Solved Append Response Template to Response Field: Â  &lt;name of standard text&gt; Send Email Response to Sender  Â  Scenario 2: Â  A ""Waiting"" or ""Unresolved"" status is applied to an incident and and the Question Receipt is configured to be sent. Â  Â In this scenario the Question Receipt Â IS sent. Â  Here Â are Â two examples rules Â for this scenario: THEN Set Status to: Â  Unresolved Send Receipt Email THEN Set Status to: Â  Waiting Send Receipt Email"

How did we receive a virus attachment?;Answer ID 6184;How did we receive a virus attachment?;['Answer ID 2345', 'Answer ID 92'];   Incoming Emails / File Attachments;  Our scanning on all hosted mailboxes is performed by Barracuda Networks and they control the definition update frequency. Â  Â We also scan files that are uploaded to the file attachment server (FAS) as they are uploaded. Â  Â These definitions are updated daily or more often. Â  Â Therefore, if a virus is created, but the definitions within the virus scanners do not yet include details for it, then it is possible for a virus to get through to an agent's desktop. Â  Â As a third line of defense, it is recommended for our customers to also run an anti-virus software on agent desktops.

Updating Intelligent Advisor;Answer ID 6243;How do I request an update (upgrade) to Intelligent Advisor?;['Answer ID 7537', 'Answer ID 6244'];   Intelligent Advisor, All Versions;  Intelligent Advisor updates Â comply with the following: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Updates Â happen automatically Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ There is no need to request an update Â (see below for self-service on test sites) Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ There is no ability to opt out of an update Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ There is no downtime associated with the update Â of an Intelligent Advisor Â site New: As soon as a quarterly release is generally available, the Â Service Cloud Configuration Assistant Â  Â allows you to create an updated Â clone of your production Intelligent Advisor Â site. Updated Â clones of the production Intelligent Advisor Â site are provided as a courtesy to allow compatibility testing of unsupported customizations. Any issues found should be fixed directly in the production site prior to the update Â date. Note that changes made to updated Â production clones are not automatically merged with the production site. For further information on Intelligent Advisor updates Â refer to: Answer ID 6244: Intelligent Advisor update schedule.

Intelligent Advisor Update Schedule;Answer ID 6244;When are Oracle Intelligent Advisor sites updated?;['Answer ID 6243', 'Answer ID 7537', 'Answer ID 9682'];   Intelligent Advisor, All Versions;"  Intelligent Advisor sites are updated automatically once each quarter.  Test sites can be updated in place using the Service Cloud Configuration Assistant at any time after general availability of the new version. Â  Test sites that have not been updated in place are automatically updated 1 day prior to production sites. Â   Intelligent Advisor Mobile App is generally available at the same time as the quarterly update takes place to that same version. Recommended Â configuration and use of test sites:  At least 1 test site should be reserved for ongoing development and testing of production site changes. Â    This site should remain on the same release as the production site Â   This site will update automatically 1 day before production sites if the site has not been updated via Service Cloud Configuration Assistant. Â    At least 1 test site should be reserved for testing of existing customizations in new quarterly releases. Â  Note: Customers should familiarize themselves with changes in each quarterly release and determine whether testing is warranted. Â  Customers using custom Javascript, controls, etc. should plan on testing each release to ensure expected behavior. Â  Â Implementations without custom Javascript, controls, etc. will typically update without issue. Â    This test site can be updated to the latest quarterly GA release through the Service Cloud Configuration Assistant by either:    ""Upgrade Test Site"" (in place update) or  ""Re-create and Upgrade Test Site"" (replace current test site with clone of production and update)     This test site should be used Â to test and prepare for Â the automatic updates of production and remaining test sites. Â  Â     The Intelligent Advisor 20B update schedule is as follows:  May 19th 2020: 20B General availability (GA) May 20th 2020: Self-service test site creation and updates to 20B may begin Â  Aug 20th Â 2020: Remaining test sites automatically updated to 20A Aug 21st 2020: Production sites automatically updated to 20A Aug 24th 2020: Intelligent Advisor 20B Mobile app available in app stores (planned) Aug 25th 2020: 20C General availability (GA) (planned)  During the Aug 21st maintenance window, all production Intelligent Advisor sites will be updated to the latest 20B quarterly release. Reminder notifications are sent approximately 1 week before quarterly service update windows. More Â information: The approximate timeline for each quarterly Intelligent Advisor release is as follows:  As soon as a release is generally available (GA), the Service Cloud configuration assistant can be used to create updated clones of production Intelligent Advisor Â sites, and to perform in-place updates of existing Intelligent Advisor Â test sites.

The Process Designer / Custom Process Models (CPM) functionality;Answer ID 6246;What is the Process Designer / Custom Process Models (CPM) functionality?;['Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   Process Designer, Custom Process Model (CPM) / Service Process Model (SPM) November 2012 version and newer;"  Â  The Process Designer / Custom Process Models (CPM) feature allows associating PHP script with object events. Business logic can be migrated to PHP code, so effectively, business rules can be performed on Custom Objects. Â The custom processes are predefined object event handlers (PHP scripts) that run as the result of an event occurring on standard or custom objects in Oracle RightNow CX Cloud Service. Object event handlers can also help your organization automate tasks based on the events that trigger them. Object event handlers are added and managed on the process designer in a virtual container Â called the process model. Once you add your object event handlers, you will need to deploy the process model in order to use the object event handlers in Oracle RightNow CX to automate tasks based on the events that trigger them. Since the process model is not written to the Oracle database until it is deployed, you can take your time when adding object event handlers. When you are ready to test the process model, you can export it and import it into a non-production site. When you are finished testing the process model, you can export it from your non-production site, import it into your production site, and deploy it. The Custom Processes feature is automatically enabled in the August 2013 release. However, permissons will still need to be enabled at the profile level. Â To enable permissions, edit the profile. Â Open Configuration -&gt; Staff Management -&gt; Profiles, select the profile, click Permissions in the ribbon, check Process Designer in the Administration Â section. Â Save and close the profile. After the permission has been set, the component may have to be added to the profile's navigation set. Â The component is called Process Designer. Â It is usually found under Configuration -&gt; Site Configuration. To add a new process:  Click New in the ribbon Enter a name for the process Enter the PHP code file by clicking the folder icon and selecting the file. Click Open. Â Note that supression should be used on update handlers. Click Save Click Test. If there are errors they must be resolved before the code can be used as a handler. Â Note that the code must be changed remotely and reloaded after each failed test If the test passes, the code may be used as a handler for a model.  For more information, see 'Adding object event handlers'.  See 'Deploy a process model' or 'Roll back a process model' for steps on these options.  For additional information, refer to the 'Custom Processes Overview' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Mailboxes setup - Hosted mailboxes must be enabled for incoming mail;Answer ID 6249;How do I fixÃ‚Â an upgrade error involving service mailboxes that are not enabled for incoming mail?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Mailboxes, Sites upgrading to August 2013 or newer;  We require that pop accounts on our servers are enabled for incoming mail in one (and only one) mailbox in the product. When a mailbox is not enabled for incoming mail:   Replies from your customers are not processed and remain on the servers. The long term storage of email messages is not allowed on our infrastructure. Â  Also, even if it is your business process to not allow customer response by email, when a customer response is received a complementary message should be returned to the customer suggesting the appropriate support channel.   Bounce handling is not performed when a mailbox is not enabled for incoming mail. Â  This is especially critical with an Outreach mailboxes as ignoring bounces may adversely impact sender reputation resulting in your Outreach communication being blacklisted.

Mailboxes setup - A pop account may be configured on only one mailbox;Answer ID 6250;How do I fix my mailboxes when I have a duplicate pop account error?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Mailboxes, Sites updating to August 2013 or newer;"  This answer is applicable if you have been informed that you have duplicate mailboxes. Â  There must be a 1:1 correspondence between pop accounts and mailboxes enabled for incoming mail on your site. Â  The reply to or from address for a pop account can be used in multiple mailboxes accross interfaces but they must be enabled for only outgoing mail. If you do not intend to create incidents assigned to a particular interface with the duplicate mailbox:  Simply remove the pop details from one mailbox and disable incoming mail. Â  Since techmail runs in parallel on each interface, you may find slightly better performance if you choose to leave the mailbox enabled on Â an interface which has fewer mailboxes enabled for incoming mail.  If you do intend to create incidents assigned to a particular interface with the duplicate mailbox:  Check for some other mechanism (such as Â business rules) Â that assigns incidents to a particular interface. Â  If there is no mechanism then there are probably incidents created by techmail assigned to both interfaces contrary to your business process. Â  If there is a mechanism in place you will have to make changes to the mechanism to allow it to function with a new mailbox on the duplicate interface or with all mail arriving on one interface. Â  Â Then either create a new mailbox enabled for both incoming and outgoing mail and assign it to the duplicate interface; or disable incoming mail from the duplicate mailbox and remove the pop information.   Cause: Pulling mail from the same mailbox from two interfaces confuses product processes which assign created incidents to a specific interface (or brand)."

Mailboxes setup - A service pop account may not be configured as an outbound mailbox;Answer ID 6251;How do I fix my mailboxes when I have a duplicate pop account error?;['Answer ID 6354'];   Mailboxes, Sites updating to August 2013 or newer;  Occasionally an Outreach mailbox is created with pop details from service pop account or vice versa. Â  Even though the mailboxes are fundamentally different in capacity and the email address this misconfiguration may work Â in daily use. However, on update these mailboxes may not work appropriately. Â  The pop details, from and reply to address in the mismatched mailbox should be replaced with those from the correct mailbox type. It may be necessary to request a new Outreach pop account or the pop details from an existing pop account of the correct type from support to make this change. If a new service pop account is required, refer to Â Configuration of Oracle-hosted Service and Outreach mailboxes Â for steps to accomplish this. If the mailbox has not been in use for some time and was not enabled for either incoming or outgoing mail then it can be deleted.

Â  If you were told your mailbox has incomplete pop infomration, please remove the pop information and disable incoming mail. Alternately, work with your mail administrators to gather the correct information and enter the pop account, pop server, and password fields. If the mailbox is hosted you can request the pop details from support.

However, when generating a report that lists opportunities, assigned account and manager, the 'manager' field shows No Value.  It is likely the managers were assigned or changed at the account level after affected opportunities were created or assigned.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â This would cause a mismatch of data.;" 1.

Editing Holidays and Service Level Agreements;Answer ID 6266;I need to edit a Holiday.Ã‚Â  Will this result in the creation of a new version of the associated SLA?;['Answer ID 2820'];   All versions, Holidays, Service Level Agreements (SLAs)Ã‚Â ;"  As a best practice we recommend not editing an SLA once the SLA has been applied to a contact, organization, or incident. Â  This is because edits to an SLA result in the creation of a new version of the SLA but the newest version of the SLA is not automatically applied to contact, organization, or incident records. Â  That said, please keep the following in mind when editing a Holiday: - Updating annually-recurring holidays: Â  When updating an anually-recurring holiday (i.e. New Year's Day), please perform the following steps to prevent the creation of a new version of Â the associated Â SLA:  1. Go to: Configuration --&gt; Services --&gt; Holidays 2. Open the Holiday editor 3. Select the holiday in question (i.e. ""New Year's Day"") 4. Â  Â Select the calendar icon and change the date (i.e. from 01/01/2013 to 01/01/2014) 5. Â  Â Select ""Save"" 6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all anually-recurring holidays (NOTE: please ensure ""Save"" is selected after each holiday modified)  Â   - Adding a holiday to an existing SLA: Â  If the holiday is added to the response requirements of an existing SLA (that has statistics associated to it), a new version of an SLA will be created. Â  When this occurs, the original terms of the SLA will still apply to any records that were associated to the SLA prior to the inclusion of the new Holiday. Â  Therefore, Â if you wish for the new terms of Â the SLA to be applied to these records, steps will need to be taken to reassociate the records to the new version of the SLA. Â The steps to do so can be found in the following answer: Â  Creating new SLAs rather than modifying existing ones - Creating a new holiday: When a new holiday is created via the Holiday editor, the SLAs are not affected. Â  However, if the new holiday is Â then associated to an existing SLA a new version of the SLA will be created (as is described just above).  Â   "

Duplicate URLs appearing in chat transcripts included in incidents;Answer ID 6280;Why is there aÃ‚Â duplicate URL, in parentheses, in the chat transcript following a URL that had been entered in a chat?;['Answer ID 2820'];  Chat, Agent Desktop; When your agents are engaged in chats with customers, it may at times be necessary to add URLs to the chat to direct the customer to useful resources. When the chat is concluded and the transcript is added to an incident, how those URLs appear will depend upon whether your agents are using the rich text thread control or a plain text thread control. If your agents are using rich text, the URLs will appear as it did when entered in the chat - as a single URL. That URL will be clickable within the incident thread, allowing one to navigate to the page. If Â your agents are using the plain text thread control, the URLs will appear to be duplicated. You will see the URL as it was entered first, followed immediately by the same URL in parentheses. Only the second URL will be clickable within the thread entry, allowing you to navigate to the page.

The ""Remove"" button is available when using the Contacts relationship item on a workspace. You will not have the Remove option if you are using a Report workspace control instead. If you find that the ""Remove"" option is not present, confirm that you are using the Contacts relationship item by opening your workspace in edit mode and double clicking within the area of your Contacts tab. You can then choose ""Show Details"" within the Design tab to see if you are using the Contacts relationship item or a Report control. If you are using a report control, you may wish to consider removing that control and replacing it with the Contacts relationship item. If you have confirmed that you are using the Contacts relationship item and find that do not have the option to remove contact records from your related list rather than delete them, you may have to adjust the configuration of the report you are using in your Contacts workspace control. Command actions may need to be added to the report you are using to enable you to not only edit the contacts object, but also the object to which your contacts are related. To resolve this issue, take the following steps: 1. Open the workspace you are using in edit mode. 2. Double click on your Contacts tab. 3. Click ""Report"" in the ribbon. You will need to choose ""Report"", and not ""Search Report"" or ""Secondary Search Report"" 4. Note the name of the report you are using and the path to that report. 5.

When enabled, you can configure the patterns you want to mask and optionally display the last four digits of the masked values in the thread. In addition, you can define up to five custom patterns that will be masked when new thread entries are created. Once incident thread masking is enabled, masking is automatically performed on credit card, social security, and telephone numbers in new thread entries, even if you make no changes to the predefined masks or define custom masks. Items that are masked cannot be ""un-masked"" by Oracle B2C Service. Â The masking occurs in the incident thread data itself, where the masked values are replaced and not recoverable.

Termination event of 4 does not necessarily mean the end-user had a problem. Â  Â Technically this termination event happens when the chat server does not receive any communication from the end-user for more than 4 minutes. Â  Â One way this can happen is if there are network issues or if an error happens. Â  Â However there are other reasons this can happen and any action that interrupts communication will result in this termination event if the agent lets the chat end automatically. Many mobile devices function in a way that can lead to increased occurrences of this termination events. Â  Â If the end-user closes the browser app without disconnecting from chat the OS will stop communication and the chat will result in this termination event after 4 minutes. This commonly seen in end-user behavior originating from devices using iOS (Apple's mobile operating system, common on devices such as iPhones). When an end-user navigate's from chat to a different application on the phone the communication to the chat server is stopped by iOS and resumes when the end-user returns to the chat as long as the end-user did not get disconnected form the chat while they were away. For example if you are engaged in a chat with an agent and the end-user uploads a file in chat or navigates to a different app on the phone. The end-user will see the following messages when they resume the chat. Communication with the Oracle B2C Service Chat service has been lost. Please wait while attempts are made to restore the connection. Â  Disconnection in XXX seconds. Â  Connection resumed. This is expected when using an iOS device such as an iPhone. Oracle does not control this behavior. Â  Another common situation that leads to this termination event is users with laptops that are configured to go into Sleep mode when the cover is closed. Â  Â There is no way to confirm this without talking to the end-user but one indication is to look at the chat discussion (i.e. did both the agent and the end-user indicate they have completed their discussion).

Creating shortcuts to launch the Service Cloud application;Answer ID 6323;How can I create a Windows Desktop or Task Bar shortcut to launch Oracle B2C Service?;['Answer ID 4026'];   All supported versions.;  During the ClickOnce installation process the Â Oracle B2C Service application will create an application Â launch file in the agents' Windows Start Menu here:   C:\Users\%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\RightNow  If the agent would like a shortcut to launch the Â Oracle B2C Service application from the Windows Desktop or Task Bar, please Â have them perform the following steps:   Desktop: 1. Select the Windows icon to open the Start Menu. 2. In the app list, select and drag the B2C Service icon  Â to your desktop. Windows creates a shortcut to the application without removing the app from the Start Menu.   Additional Notes: The RightNow launch icon in the Windows Start Menu is a ClickOnce application reference file, not a shortcut. This file should never be moved from its original location as determined by the installation process. Doing so will result in unexpected behavior of the ClickOnce installation or update process.

Creating a report that shows Oracle B2C Service mailboxes;Answer ID 6324;How do I create a report that shows my mailbox configuration?;['Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 5468', 'Answer ID 7537'];   Mailboxes, Sites on version August 2013 or newer;  Note that this report is useful for managing Â mailboxes on your site across multiple interfaces. Â For more assistance in creating a report refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a basic custom report . Â  For information on best practices for mailboxes setup refer to Answer ID 5468: Suggestions for mail setup. 1. Open the Reports Explorer and create a standard report with the following columns:  mailboxes.interface_id mailboxes.type mailboxes.default mailboxes.name mailboxes.pop_server mailboxes.pop_account mailboxes.enabled mailboxes.from_address mailboxes.reply_to mailboxes.friendly_from  2. Right click the Pop Server, Pop Account, Enabled, From Address, Reply To Address, and Friendly From Address Â columns and select edit format. Â  Select Display blank on the Text tab in Null values. 3. Right click the Interface column and select edit format and select Hide repeating values on the Alignment tab in Repeating Values. 4. In the ribbon click Home, Sort. Â  Sort the columns by Interface, Default Mailbox descending, Mailbox Type descending, and then Name. 5. The standard verbiage for mailboxes.enabled is quite long. You can use the following formula to shorten that column: decode(mailboxes.enabled, 0, '', 1, 'In',2,'Out',3,'In/Out') 6. Â Save and close the report. Note: Â If you change your mailbox settings you will need to click the refresh button in the ribbon of this report view to see updated information. Notes on the columns in the mailboxes table. There should be one default mailbox for Service and Outreach for each interface that is enabled for incoming and outgoing mail unless mail is pulled from that pop account on another interface. Mail must be pulled from each pop account (email addresses are pop_account@domain.com) Â on one and only one interface. From address is the only required address and should reflect the full hosted email address such as pop_account@mailmw.custhelp.com or pop_account@mailmw.rnmk.com. Â  Reply to and Friendly From addresses are optional and may be used for branding. Hosted mailboxes (pop accounts on our servers) may be created and deleted in Oracle B2C Service Configuration Assistant. Pop account and server values for hosted mailboxes are added automatically by the product and are not editable in the mailbox editor. Â  To create and configure non-hosted branded email addresses refer to your sites mail administrators. Cause: New functionality in versions August 2013 and above and the self serve mailbox controls require that mailboxes be set appropriately. Â This report can be used to help plan and troubleshoot mailbox configuration.

Using a custom answers/details page;Answer ID 6336;How do I direct the links on the answers/list page to a custom details page?;['Answer ID 9573', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Answers, End-user pages, Analytics Oracle B2C Service;"  To specify a different answer detail page, you need to:  From the answers/list page, determine which report ID is used.   Note: If it is report ID 176, from the administration console, you need to copy that report and note the ID for the new report. Then you will need to update your home and answer pages to use the custom report ID that you just created.   From the admin console, open the custom report for editing. Right-click on the Summary column (which is typically used to generate the link to the answers/detail page) and select Edit Format. From the pop-up, click the URL tab. Click the ""Advanced URL definition"" link. Enable the checkbox for ""Begin with server end-user URL"". Then in the top row of the fields (right below the ""Simple URL definition"" link) enter the part of the URL to use to generate the URL to your custom page.   For example, if my custom detail page is named ""custom_page"" and lives in a folder with the path -- Â  development/views/pages/custom_folder -- I would set the top row to ""app/custom_folder/custom_page/a_id/"" . In the right column, set the field to answer ID so that the answer ID value gets added to the URL.   Save the report and then test in development mode.

Mailboxes Setup - Mailbox has not been migrated to Mogmail/Pod servers;Answer ID 6337;Why do I need to change my mail configuration that shows obsolete pod information?;['Answer ID 9573', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Mailboxes, Sites updating to August 2013 or newer;   If you receive an incident from Technical Support suggesting that you have a missing mailbox but you find that mailbox in the mailboxes configuration, it is possible that the mailbox has not been migrated to our new servers or new pod address. Check the mailboxes on your site and check the hosted mailboxes pop accounts. Â  If you find that they are all on the same servers then there is probably no issue. If you find that the mailbox listed as missing is on a different server than the rest, then the mailbox may have not been migrated. Â   Example: Your mailbox is customersupport@mailap.custhelp.com and the rest of your mailboxes are on mailgb.custhelp.com.  As we are moving mailbox configurations, we now require that all data match from the CX mailboxes table to what actually exists on our servers. Â Therefore pop server, Â from, and reply to addresses may no longer have the following addresses:  mailuk.custhelp.com maileu.custhelp.com mailnj.custhelp.com mailch.custhelp.com  Also, if your site has been migrated to a Â different  Â pod, you should no longer use the previous pod information. NOTE: Even though we are requiring changes to the mailbox configuration, we still have redirects in place to handle mail sent to obsolete pods. Â  However, if you have SMTP forward rules in place that list obsolete pods, we suggest that you change the addresses to your current pod name. Cause: New functionality in versions August 2013 and above and the self serve mailbox controls require that mailboxes be set appropriately.

Profile and Software Management Applications;Answer ID 6342;Is the Service Cloud applicationÃ‚Â supported with Profile and or Software Management Applications?;['Answer ID 9573', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Supported versions.; The Oracle B2C Service Â application Â is not Â supported with Profile Management and or Software Management Applications. Please avoid using Profile Management applications or Software Management applications or systems. Cause: Profile Management applications. Profile Management applications create a Roaming Profile or emulate a Windows Roaming Profile and Â limit a users access to their Windows Profile. The Oracle B2C Service application Â application is installed using Â Microsoft's ClickOnce technology. This technology is not supported by Microsoft with roaming profiles. For details see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2571899 Software Â Management applications. Software Management applications block or stop software installation and or software updates based on a set of specific rules. They can also restrict deployment of application components into a users Windows Profile. Since Oracle B2C Service Â is a dynamic Â cloud application and can change at any time, it is most likely that installation or deployment criteria can change at any time. Â  Deployment issues related to the deployment of Â  Oracle B2C Service in a roaming profile environment, when using Â Profile Management applications, and or Software Management application or systems are not supported by Oracle RightNow.

Using Workspace Rules;Answer ID 6348;Overview of using workspace rules.;['Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   Workspace Rules Oracle B2C Service;  Â  With Workspace rules, Â you can dynamically adjust the display, behavior, and values of fields and controls on a workspace based on Â a staff accounts Â actions. (Workspace rules are not available for multi-edit workspaces.) Each rule is triggered by one or more events and conditions you define, and can result in one or more actions, including the following: 1. Set the value of a field 2. Set the required status of a field 3. Make a field or control read-only 4. Show or hide a field or control 5. Show only a select group of menu items Basically, a workspace rule is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“when-thenÃ¢â‚¬Â statement you use to control the behavior of fields and controls on your workspace, such as the following: 1. When the status is changed, then make the Product field required. 2. When the disposition is changed, then make the Status field noneditable. Each rule defines a triggering event and a resulting action that will occur after the event is triggered. In some cases, you may find that the triggers available for rules are not precise enough to address a specific business need. You can make a rule more restrictive by adding conditions under which the event will trigger an action. If conditions are specified in a rule, actions will be triggered only if those conditions are met. For example, your rule could state that when a button is clicked, if the status is Unresolved, assign the record to the logged-in staff member. The button click is the triggering event, but the Unresolved status is the condition under which that event will trigger the action after the button is clicked. There are two types of actions Â when using Â workspace rules: Then and Else. Every rule has at least one Then action, which is the result of the triggering event and conditions. However, once conditions are specified for a rule, you can also add one or more Else actions. An Else action is triggered in cases where the ruleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conditions are not met. For example, a rule could state that when the status changes, if the value of the status is Solved, make the Disposition field editable, or else make the Assigned field editable. In this case, when the rule is evaluated, the Assigned field will be made editable if the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status has not been set to Solved. Please note, since business rules are checked after workspace rules, changes made to a record by workspace rules can be overridden by business rules if the rules Â have similar actions. For additional information, refer to the 'Overview of workspace rules' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running on. Â  To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Unable to save contact email address with two successive periods;Answer ID 6350;Why am I unable to save a contact record that contains two consecutive periods in the local part of the email address?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle B2C Service;  The Oracle Â Service Cloud Â application complies with RFC 5322 and Internet Message Format standards. RFC 5322 specifically states that the locally interpreted string is either a quoted-string or a dot-atom and cannot consist of two successive periods or a trailing period. For example: john..smith@domain.com There may be some email providers who allow the local string of the email address to contain successive periods, even though this is not RFC 5322 compliant. Unfortunately, it is not possible to workaround this standard through the Oracle B2C Service product and save a contact email address with two successive periods.

Negative Value in the Response Interval Column;Answer ID 6351;Why is there a negative value in the Response Interval column in my report?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Incident Reports; The Â Response Interval Â column, representative of the sla_resp_delta database column, is the number of minutes the incident was outside the response threshold specified by its response requirements. It will display a negative value if the first response was sent within the response requirements for the incident. In the following scenario, Â the SLA response time is 48 hours. Â An incident Â was created at 02:00 on December the 31st and the first response was due at 2:00 on January the 2nd. The first response was sent roughly 15 minutes after the incident was created. Because the response was sent before the response due time had elapsed, the value in Â  Â sla_resp_delta will be a negative number. The sla_resp_delta in this case will be -2865, since there were 47.75 hours to go until the response was due. The sla_resp_delta column will contain a positive value when the first response is sent after the response due time has elapsed.

Unexpected end of the file has occurred. The following elements are not closed: exec_rv. soap:Body,soap:Envelop.Line 8, position 1;"  One option for why Â this error is returned from the server is because of the high number of rows that the generated report has to return on the same page.  Example: Â  This illustrates a report that returns upwards of 500k +.    In order for results to be returned as expected, Â edit the row limit per page that the report is returning. This limit should be set to maximum 10,000 records, and could be defined in Â two ways: 1. Open the report in edit mode, then go to the ""Level"" tab and select ""Record Limit"". Set the limit to 10,000 rows; OR 2. The configuration setting VRL_HARD specifies the limit of the number of rows that can be displayed in a report and the default value is 10,000. If this value has been increased, you may want to consider setting it back to the default value. For more information on this setting, see Answer ID 5422: Report results limited to 10,000. If this information does not resolve your issue, submit a service request to Ask Technical Support for additional assistance."

Configuration of Oracle-hosted Service and Outreach mailboxes;Answer ID 6354;How do I add or edit Oracle hosted Service mailboxes for version August 2013 and newer?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 331', 'Answer ID 331'];   Versions August 2013 and newer, Configuration Assistant;"  Oracle-managed Service mailboxes are used for sending and receiving emails on incidents. They are hosted by Oracle and their email addresses usually have a @custhelp.com domain. Oracle-managed Outreach mailboxes are used for sending outreach emails like survey invitations and mailings. They are hosted by Oracle and their email addresses usually have a @rnmk.com domain. NOTE: Â Non-Oracle hosted mailboxes (Service or Outreach) are not created or managed through Configuration Assistant. Adding and configuring them for use with Oracle B2C Service is done through Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes section in the Oracle B2C Service Console, but creating the mailboxes is not possible with the self-service tools mentioned here. Before moving forward with creating these mailboxes, please note the following mailbox naming requirements: 1. It cannot exceed 80 characters 2. Cannot start with a number 3. Cannot contain consecutive underscores 4. Can only contain letters, digits, underscores, periods and dashes 5. Name must be unique. If you choose a name of an already existing mailbox within all of Oracle B2C Service, you will receive a notification stating so. 6. The following names are reserved: ['security', 'postmaster', 'webmaster', 'abuse', 'root', 'toor', 'operator', 'support', 'noc', 'notify', 'admin', 'administrator', 'system', 'questions', 'help', 'training', 'dmt', 'foo', 'proservices', 'hms', 'ums', 'pms', 'csi'] Important: If you have received a welcome email for the Oracle Cloud Portal service, then you must use the Configuration Assistant option to create, delete, enable or disable these mailboxes.  If you have questions regarding this service, please contact your account manager.  To manage the mailboxes hosted by Oracle, see the below instructions. Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  Â  Â  Â  Â   Â Using Configuration Assistant for Oracle-managed Service mailboxes Â    Through the Configuration Assistant, you are able to manage Service mailboxes on both production and upgrade sites. 1.

Refer to Â Answer ID 331: Setting up mailboxes in Oracle B2C Service Â for more details.    Â  Before disabling or deleting any mailbox that accepts incoming email, it is important to ensure emails are not arriving from customers. Here are some tips to prevent loss of mail: a. Work with other groups in your organization to understand how a mailbox is used and any impact from disabling or deleting the mailbox. b. Create a report that shows incidents by the incidents.mailbox_id field. This will give an indication of when and if the mailbox was used for service. c. Enable incoming mail on mailboxes that are set for only outgoing mail. This will allow the techmail utility to pull mail and create or update incidents. Since there may be old mail in the mailbox, it may be useful to first create a rule that moves incidents from the mailbox to a specific queue for isolation from other incidents. Note: If you have disabled incoming mail in Configuration Assistant you must also disable outgoing mail in the product. We do not allow hosted mailboxes to be enabled for outgoing only."

Editing Analytics folder permissions for a profile;Answer ID 6367;When trying to edit the Analytics permissions in a Profile, why does the Open/Edit checkbox not allow me to save changes for an empty reportÃ‚Â folder?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Oracle B2C Service Staff Account Profiles;"  This behavior is working as designed. The Analytics permissions feature within a Staff Profile is designed to allow Open and Edit permissions on reports and not folders. The purpose of the folder check box is to allow the user to perform a ""Select All' on all reports inside the folder. If the folder is empty and does not contain any reports within it, then it will not be possible to select the checkbox for the Open and/or Edit permissions for that empty folder. However, if there is at least one report within the folder, then it will be possible to select the Open and/or Edit checkbox permissions for that folder.  For additional information, refer to the 'Analytics permissions' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.

Chat unavailable when there are no agent sessions available;Answer ID 6369;Why is chat unavailable when there are no agent sessions available?;['Answer ID 2819'];  Customer Portal, Chat Issue  I would like my customers to be able to launch chats and wait in queue for the next available agent if there are no agents available at the time the chat is requested. However,Ã‚Â chat unavailable when there are no agent sessions available.; If you would like your customers to be able to launch chats regardless of whether or not there is an agent available, and if necessary wait in queue for the next available agent, consider adjusting the parameters of the ConditionalChatLink widget. The min_sessions_avail parameter defines the minimum number of open agent sessions that must be available in order for the link to be actionable. If the parameter is set to 0 it is disabled. When the setting is set to any number above 0 there will need to be at least that number of available sessions in order for a customer to launch a chat. When set to 1, for example, there must be at least 1 session available in order for the link to be available to your customers. If you would like to disable this setting to enable your customers to launch chats regardless of whether there are agent chat sessions available, Â adjust the ConditionalChatLink widget so that min_sessions_avail is 0. Displaying a wait time is dependant of this information being available Â to the server. The average wait time is calculated based on samples gathered from chat activity. Until the required number of samples have been gathered, the widget will be unavailable when no agents sessions are available regardless of what min_sessions_avail is set to. The required number of samples can be Â altered Â by modifying Â the AVERAGE_WAIT_TIME_SAMPLES configuration base. For more information regarding wait times, refer to Answer ID 2819: Chat estimated wait time information.

How to add a new standard Channel;Answer ID 6370;I am unable to add a new standard Channel as the 'New' button is grayed out.;['Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   All Versions / Standard Channels;"  The standard product functionality does not allow the option to add or delete the standard channels in reference to which incidents are created and responded to. Â There is not a workaround available for this. Â  However, you are able to edit a channel name that suits your business requirements. You are also able to edit channel types so that your agents can add information about channel user names by adding the Channel Usernames field to a custom contact workspace and then assign that workspace to the profile used by agents.

Field changes not saving when records are multi-edited;Answer ID 6374;Why are my field changes not saving when I edit a record in the multi-edit workspace?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Multi-Edit Workspaces; If you find that modifications made to multiple records via the multi-edit workspace are not being committed on save, review the multi-edit workspace you are using to ensure that the same field has not been added to the same workspace more than once. If you have added the same field to the workspace multiple times and you modify one instance of the field, you are essentially telling the same field to change and not change simultaneously. As a consequence of this conflict, no change is made. To resolve this issue you may either change all instances of the same field on the workspace to the same value prior to saving, or remove the redundant fields from your workspace.

Custom Controls for Oracle Policy Modeling;Answer ID 6380;How do I create and use custom controls in an Intelligent Advisor interview?;['Answer ID 5168'];    Intelligent Advisor,Ã‚Â latestÃ‚Â release;  Custom controls allow completely customized styling to be applied to controls on the Â  Intelligent Advisor interview screens.  In Latest version interviews, custom controls are only supported for label controls. In August 2016 version interviews, custom controls are supported for text input controls and label controls.  To customize the styling and behavior of any control type, use interview extensions instead.   For a policy modeler to use a custom control on an interview screen, a custom control handler must be provided. Programming expertise is needed to create the custom control handler that provides dynamic HTML content for a custom control. Each custom control handler returns a HTML Â snippet that will be included within the Intelligent Advisor screen at the point where the control appears. A custom control handler is passed the current interview session data, and can choose to use some, none or all of that data in deciding how to render its response. There is an alternate version of the Emergency Response example project that uses custom controls.

Email address limitation;Answer ID 6381;Is there a limit to the size / characters of an email address value?;['Answer ID 5358', 'Answer ID 6677'];   Email address field in various tables, All versions;"  Â  Â  Yes, there is a limit of 80 characters. Examples of where this applies are business rules, contacts.email and accounts.email. Business Rule: In a Â rule that uses a condition to send an email message, the email recipient (send to) value is limited to 80 characters. For example, if you have Â a rule that includes an action ""Then"" statement of choose email &gt; email incident information the email address Â value must be &lt;= 80 characters. Contact Email Address: If the contact email address has more than 80 characters, the incoming message will be filtered.

Please refer to Â Answer ID 5358: Filtered Rejected Emails for additional information. Â  Â  Also note that, in some cases, the From address might look ok, as it has less than 80 characters, but the Reply-to address has more than 80 characters. Â  Â The Reply-to address takes precedence over the From address and as a result, the message will get filtered.

Querying custom fields through ROQL;Answer ID 6390;How do I query for custom fields using ROQL?;['Answer ID 5168'];   ROQL, SOAP API;"  In order to query for custom fields through ROQL an ObjectTemplate must be supplied with the query. While the code that will produce a SOAP envelope containing a ROQL query for custom fields can be written differently when using different access points, the resultant SOAP envelope will be similar. Utilizing the QueryObjects call with templating will result in a SOAP envelope like the following: &lt;s:Envelope xmlns:u='http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd' xmlns:s='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/'&gt;  Â  Â &lt;s:Header&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;h:ClientInfoHeader xmlns='urn:messages.ws.rightnow.com/v1_2' xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:h='urn:messages.ws.rightnow.com/v1_2' xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;AppID&gt;Basic Objects Sample&lt;/AppID&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;/h:ClientInfoHeader&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;o:Security s:mustUnderstand='1' xmlns:o='http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd'&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;o:UsernameToken u:Id='uuid-84093390-78b8-44db-acba-6a792c0a22a3-1'&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;o:Username&gt;user&lt;/o:Username&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;o:Password&gt;password&lt;/o:Password&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;/o:UsernameToken&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;/o:Security&gt;  Â  Â &lt;/s:Header&gt;  Â  Â &lt;s:Body xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;QueryObjects xmlns='urn:messages.ws.rightnow.com/v1_2'&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;Query&gt;SELECT Incident FROM Incident WHERE ID = 1&lt;/Query&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;ObjectTemplates xmlns:q1='urn:objects.ws.rightnow.com/v1_2' xsi:type='q1:Incident'&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;q1:CustomFields /&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;/ObjectTemplates&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;PageSize&gt;10000&lt;/PageSize&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;/QueryObjects&gt;  Â  Â &lt;/s:Body&gt; &lt;/s:Envelope&gt; The following pages of documentation contain additional information on this topic: QueryObjects ROQL and Common Objects ROQL and Custom Objects Â  Alternatively, custom fields can be queried for using the QueryCSV function without the use of an object template.

Changes of mailbox reply to address on update;Answer ID 6395;Why did the mailboxes.reply_to address change on updateÃ‚Â for Oracle Managed Service Mailboxe?;['Answer ID 4784'];   UpdatesÃ‚Â to versions August 2013 and newer.;  When updating Â to versions August 2013 and newer, it is possible that Â the reply to addresses on Oracle managed service mailboxes were changed to the hosted mailbox reply address. Â  This will disturb the reply to settings that were configured in earlier versions. You can set the friendly_from address if you wish and leave the reply_to address the same. Â  This will brand the email as being from your organization but will deliver emails directly to our hosted mailboxes. Â  Â  If you have SMTP forwarding set up at your own address you will need to set the reply_to address back to your mailbox address. If you would like us to change to the reply_to addresses back to what was on your site before update, please make the request through an incident. Note that the from address of hosted mailboxes should be set to the hosted mailbox reply to address and not to your server. Â  This address is the bounce address and if it is not set to our server bounces will not be handled properly.

Survey Results Contain No Contact Email Address;Answer ID 6399;"Why does my ""Survey Responses by Contact (report id 7018)"" report not always display an email address associated with a response?";['Answer ID 4784'];  Survey Editor, survey results reports; If you find that some of your survey responses do not contain an email address associated with responses review the configuration of the survey to determine whether the survey is configured to allow anonymous responses. The 'Allow Anonymous' checkbox appears in the survey Summary tab to the right of the name of the assigned agent. When a survey is configured to allow anonymous responses, Contact information is not required. This means that a customer can submit the survey with no personal details entered, in which case the survey results may not always contain an email address associated with each response. Selecting Allow Anonymous in your survey does not mean that all responses are anonymous. If a survey invitation is sent to a contact or an Oracle RightNow CX cookie is detected on the contactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s computer, or the survey itself contains an email address field, Feedback attempts to use that information to identify the contact.

Always use the full domain name in mailbox reply to addresses;Answer ID 6404;"Can I use ""mail@custhelp.com"" instead of ""mail@mailmw.custhelp.com"" in from and reply to addresses?";['Answer ID 4784'];   Mailbox configuration, all versions;  We suggest that you always use the full domain name when setting mailbox Reply To and From addresses to a current hosted server address. Â This applies to both Service and Outreach mailboxes.  Examples: popaccount1@mailgb.custhelp.com popaccount2@mailca.custhelp.com popaccount3@mailmw.custhelp.com popaccount4@mailsy.custhelp.com popaccount5@mailwc.custhelp.com popaccount6@mailsy.rnmk.com  We also suggest that you change any old pod names such as mailuk, maileu, mailnj to the name of your current pod name. Often times mailboxes are not reconfigured after a pod migration. Cause: While we do have redirects in place to handle mail sent to an address without a subdomain, such as @custhelp.com, it is not suggested to rely on those addresses. Always use the full name or mail may be directed to a pod that is in a different physical location than the one on which your site exists. Â  Then the mail may be filtered by the default settings in the spam filter on that pod.

AUP allows you to stay current on Service Cloud features and functionality. Â Product releases occur four times a year: February (A), May (B), August (C) and November (D). Â   Process Overview  The following steps reoccur for each Service Cloud release in alignment with a Â site's Update Preferences:  An email will be sent after General Availability Â to remind you about the Â scheduled update. The email will include the 'upgrade site creation date' for your site. Â (You can skip or reschedule Â in Configuration Assistant.) Â    If you have any conflicting production development, please change the site creation date in Configuration Assistant.   A second Â email will be sent seven days before the update is scheduled to begin Â to further remind you. Your upgrade site will be automatically created on the scheduled date. A Â notification will be sent when the upgrade site creation process starts.   At this point your site is locked into the release and Custom Object deployments are locked.  Cutover is scheduled to align with the site's Update Preferences (Two weeks later by default).  The exact clone start time is not applicable because the upgrade site database is built from Â data backups. Â  Backups are created at different times in different data centers but are generally reflective of the production data within a 24 hours window.   A Â notification will be sent when the upgrade site creation process finishes.

Â   Notifications are sent to confirm the start and end of the update downtime (Generally five minutes of downtime)   Conduct post cutover testing (recommended)   Report questions or problems    Any contact on your organization record who has opted in to Â Auto Update Program messaging will receive Â all the messages listed above. Â You can opt in or out of these messages by modifying your contact profile.  Overview This Â presentation provides a comprehensive discussion about best practices for configuring and executing updates for your Service Cloud site. Topics include scheduling options, acceptance testing, and product changes. Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Service Cloud Updates  Benefits Running the latest version of Â Oracle B2C Service means that you have access to the latest product capabilities to deliver maximum value to your customers, call center agents, and administrators. Automated updates streamline the update experience so your time can be spent delivering value to your customers instead of engaging in lengthy update processes.  Qualification Any site that utilizes standard product functionality and associated configuration options qualifies for the Auto Update Program. Sites that also utilize custom capability such as custom .php scripts, addins, custom objects, Connect Web Services, REST, and cron jobs will qualify for the Auto Update Program if the custom capability is entirely built within backward compatible managed frameworks such as Connect. To see if your site qualifies, contact your Technical Migration Manager or Account Executive for a review of your implementation.  Enrollment All Service Cloud sites implemented on the May 2014 version and newer are automatically enrolled in the Auto Update Program. As of May 1, 2017, participation in the Auto Update Program is required for all Oracle B2C Service production sites that adhere to the technical requirements for the Auto Update Program.  For More Information To see if your site qualifies for the Auto Update Program, contact your Technical Migration Manager or submit a service request. To ask a general question about the update process, submit a service request or post your question on our General Discussion Forum. To report a technical problem, Â submit a service request.  Notes Service requests submitted during the update cycle and after update Â are subject to the standard service level targets specified for your organization and service request severity. Oracle B2C Service support agreements can be found on the Oracle web site. Oracle customers are responsible for addressing Oracle B2C Service Â Deprecations before the deprecated capability is removed and the siteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s readiness to upgrade is lost.

Custom Error Pages not displaying in Internet Explorer;Answer ID 6417;Why aren't my custom error pages showing up in Internet Explorer?;['Answer ID 5879'];  This answer applies to Customer Portal page sets, Internet Explorer (IE) Oracle B2C Service; When custom error pages display as expected in all browsers except for Internet Explorer (IE), it is often due to the minimum byte count restrictions for IE. Custom error pages must be greater than 512 bytes in size. If they are not, IE will instead display it's own default error page. For additional details on configuration of custom error pages, see Answer ID 5879: Custom Error Pages.

Internet Explorer version and Oracle B2C Service Customizations;Answer ID 6418;What version of Internet Explorer is used by Oracle B2C Service Agent Console browser controls?;['Answer ID 5879'];   This answer applies to browser controls and other instances of Internet Explorer (IE) within the Oracle B2C Service agent console;"  By default, the Oracle B2C Service Console places Internet Explorer (IE) in an IE7 compatibility mode. This is done intentionally so that third party developers can target a consistent platform regardless of the version of IE that is installed on the workstation. For example, if IE10 is installed on the workstation, Oracle B2C Service will Â use IE10 but place it into IE7 compatibility mode. This works well for most developers, and is by Microsoft's design. However, some developers may want to target a newer version of IE. To accomplish this, they need to do two things: install the targeted version of IE on all workstations, and instruct Â Oracle B2C Service to use a newer version of IE. The latter is done through HTML Meta tags. This is known as ""defining document compatibility"". To instruct the Oracle B2C Service Console to use the newest installed version of IE, the developer who creates the embedded web page must include this in the HTML header: &lt;meta content=""IE=edge"" /&gt; For example: &lt;html&gt;  Â  Â  Â &lt;head&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;meta content=""IE=edge"" /&gt;  Â  Â  Â &lt;/head&gt;  Â  Â  Â &lt;body&gt;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;p&gt;Content goes here.&lt;/p&gt;  Â  Â  Â &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Some developers may want to target an exact version of IE. They can do this using the same meta tag but with different content value: &lt;meta http-equiv=""x-ua-compatible"" content=""IE=9"" &gt; Additional information regarding the targeting of IE versions via meta tags can be found here: Â  Defining document compatibility. Â   Beginning in May 2016: If you are unable to change the web page code you will now have another option in the May 2016 release. Â  A new profile option will set the .NET browser control to run in IE11 emulation mode rather than the default IE7 mode. For information on this feature and step-by-step instructions see Browser Control Community discussion. Additional information is also available in online documentation. See Step #16 in the 'Add or edit a profile' section of that release document."

Configuring incident archiving;Answer ID 6421;How can I calculate how many incidents are waiting to be archived and how to configure incident archiving?;['Answer ID 6658', 'Answer ID 2509', 'Answer ID 605'];   Archiving incidents. Analytics Oracle B2C Service;"  Here is how to estimate the number of incidents in your database that are ready to be archived. Use the report described in this answer to estimate how long it will take to archive incidents up to a specific age. The speed at which archiving occurs depends on how much data is associated with incidents. By default the utility is configured to perform batches of 100,000 per run. Â The configuration to archive incidents prior to 18B release is set per interface, so a calculation for each interface is required. Post 18B release, the configuration is site specific and can be configured and enabled in Data Lifecycle Policies in the Browser Agent. Please refer to Archiving incidents on test or upgrade sites Â for information on how to test incident archiving. For help creating a basic report, refer to Answer ID 2509: Creating a basic custom report. To create a report that estimates closed incidents that are ready to archive: 1. Create a standard report with the following columns:  Heading: Date Closed Expression: date_format(incidents.closed,'YYYY-MM-DD') Heading: Archive Days Expression: time_format(date_diff(to_date(date_format(sysdate(),'MM-DD-YYYY'),'MM-DD-YYYY'),incidents.closed),'DD') If you have incidents that are assigned to multiple interfaces you should also add the following column. Heading: Interface Expression: incidents.interface_id Heading: Count Expression: count(*)  2. Sort the Date Created column descending. 3. Create Â the following Â filter(s):  Name: Closed Expression: incidents.closed Operator: between Value: -60 months relative to -12 Â months relative (these are example values for archiving incidents closed between 1 and 5 years) Alternately Name: Closed date Uncheck Make this filter selectable at runtime Expression: incidents.closed Operator: is not null Name: Status closed Expression: incidents.status Operator: in list Value(s): closed If you have incidents that are assigned to multiple interfaces you should also add the following filter. Name: Interfaces Expression: incidents.interface_id Operator: in list  4. Click the Home tab, then Â Options, More options and change the Data Source to ""Report Database"" (also known as the Â replication server). 5. Preview the report while adjusting the Created filter to show the oldest incidents and save the report. Â  Note that there may be multiple rows returned for one created date. Â  This is due to the way time is calculated during daylight savings time depending on the TZ_INTERFACE setting. Â  For information on this setting, refer to Answer ID 605: Setting the time zone in Oracle B2C Service. 6. For releases prior to 18B, edit the ARCHIVE_INCIDENTS configuration setting by going to Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Settings &gt;Agedatabase Utility &gt; Batch Processing &gt; Incident Archiving and wait for the agedatabase utility to run over night. Beginning with the 18B release, incident archiving can be configured and enabled in Data Lifecycle Policies in the Browser Agent. Â  Note, when testing the incident archiving feature on a test site, edit the value Â and Â submit a service request to Â Technical Support Â and request to manually run the archiving utility. Â  Â On a test site, we will run Â this utility Â once for your testing purposes. If you wish to track how many incidents that you have archived you must save the values of this report into a spreadsheet. Â  There is no built in functionality that tracks archived incidents. Cause: The incident archiving functionality Â allows closed incidents to be permanently deleted from the database. Â  Set the value according to your organization's data retention policy and to help reduce the size of your database."

If you do not see 'Analytics Usage', you will not be able to report on the table and field. Â  The 'ruleacts' and 'ruleconds' tables are not reportable as shown below because they do not have 'Analytics Usage' information. The 'Analytics Usage' information will be listed in the Column Information section of the Data Dictionary. Notice in the screen captures below that there is no Analytics Usage listed.  The following screen capture is simply to illustrate where the 'Analytics Usage' will appear within the Column Information in the Data Dictionary.  For more information on the Data Dictionary, refer to Â Answer ID 2611: Accessing the data dictionary Â and the online documentation for your version.

Unable to deliver scheduled report: Email attachment exceeded allowable size;Answer ID 6443;Why does my export to excel work but my schedule fail because of file size?;['Answer ID 31'];   Analytics,Ã‚Â All versions;  When a report is scheduled using the excel format, the system is not actually able to export the file to excel, but rather exports the file using xml and appends the .xls file extension to it. Because of this, reports scheduled as excel will be much larger in file size than those exported as excel. You may also notice that when you open a report schedule via excel that you get a warning message: The file you are trying to open, 'excel Test.xls', is in a different format than specified by the file extension. Verify that the file is not corrupted and is from a trusted source before opening the file. Do you want to open the file now? This warning message is for the above mentioned explanation. If you are unable to schedule a report using excel because the file size is too large, try exporting the report using comma delimited. If the file size is below 7mb then try scheduling the report using that format. Â Comma delimited files are treated as text files with no additional formatting added in the process. Â You can edit these files in Â Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet software.

This is what is considered a transient code and cannot be used for reporting. It will be a timing condition that happens every once in a while when a chat is launched right before we record information in the database. We write data every 30 seconds so if it showed up in a report it should go away 30 seconds later.

Trouble adding schedules and schedules sometimes fail;Answer ID 6454;Why am I having trouble adding schedules to my reports?Ã‚Â  Why do my scheduled reports sometimes fail to run?;['Answer ID 5498'];  All versions, analytics, scheduled reports, utilities; Having reports or dashboards that include a large number of schedules (i.e., Â 10 or more), or having multiple schedules set to run at the same time, or having multiple reports and/or dashboards all set to run at the same time can cause problems. This is because the design of the utility that generates and sends scheduled reports is sequential and runs every 15 minutes by default. Â  Â The process goes through the list of reports set to run at that time one by one. Â  Â If there are too many reports all set to run at the same time, or a few very large reports all set to run at the same time, the utility will not have enough time to finish all of them and, therefore, some may not be sent, and/or the utility may fail and not properly recover. A Â suggestion to help improve the performance of scheduled reports include making good use of the available schedule intervals and staggering the schedules. Â  The application allows for reports to be scheduled daily, weekly, hourly, monthly, and yearly, Â on 15 minute intervals. Â  By batching the schedules in various run times, rather than trying to run them all at the same time, you will see improved performance of the reports. For your convenience, you can use report ID 13000 (Report Schedules) to view the report schedule details, which can Â help you determine how you Â might improve the handling of your scheduled reports.

Wrap-up Time and Delay Between Chats Settings;Answer ID 6483;How do the Delay Between Chats and Wrap-up Time settings work?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Chat - Agent Console Oracle B2C Service;  The 'Delay Between Chats' setting controls the time between invitations. Â  Â In an example profile, if the delay is set to 30 seconds, an agent will receive one invitation and then 30 seconds later a second invitation, and so on. Â  Â This is helpful for when an agent first logs into chat. Â  Â If the queue is full, the agent will not receive multiple chat invitations all at one time. Â  Â There will be a 30 second delay between each invitation the agent receives, up to the Max Sessions value. Â  Â  Â  For additional information, refer to the 'Add Chat permissions to a profile' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. Wrap-up mode is designed to allow the agent to complete any post-chat tasks such as creating an incident, adding the chat to an existing incident, or creating an opportunity from the chat. Â Wrap-up time is configurable and represents a guideline in which the agent should finish pos-chat operations. NOTE: Â Chat will not close automatically after the wrap-up timer expires. In order to achieve this, the agent must manually click on the 'Terminate' button from the ribbon. If an agent is set to a Max Session value of 3 Â and they have three active sessions, once one chat completes, that agent will then have one available session.Chats that are in wrap-up mode count as an active session. For additional information, refer to the 'Configure incident creation and editing for chat' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. In the above scenario, with one available session, and as long as at least 30 seconds have passed since the last invitation was received, the agent will then receive the next chat invitation.

Discard Filters on mailboxes;Answer ID 6492;How do the discard filters function on mailboxes?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Mailboxes, Incoming Email;" For mailboxes configured for Incoming Email there are options to discard emails. Â  These options include the ability to discard based on: Addresses Headers Subject Body Mime Type File Types To locate these options, select Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Mailboxes. Open a mailbox for edit and Â select Incoming Email from the top ribbon. Â  The matching logic for these 4 elements differs. Â  The match logic for Addresses utilizes exact match or wildcard match with the exception of character case. Â  The other 3 elements (Headers, Subject, Body) utilize text/string match; meaning if a defined string/text is found within the respective element it will be discarded. Â  Provided below are some examples of how these filters function:  Â  Addresses example 1:  filter is: Â  domain.com incoming email address is: Â  test.person@domain.com Result: Â  The incoming email is NOT discarded as the incoming email address of ""test.person@domain.com"" Â does NOT equal the filter value of ""domain.com"". Addresses example 2:  filter is: Â  test.person@domain.com incoming email 1 has an Â address of: Â  test.person@domain.com incoming email Â 2 has an address of: Â  thistest.person@domain.com Result: Â  Incoming email 1 Â IS discarded as the incoming email address of ""test.person@domain.com"" equals the filter value of ""test.person@domain.com"". Â  Incoming email 2 is NOT discarded as the incoming email address of ""thistest.person@domain.com"" does not equal the filter value of ""test.person@domain.com"". Addresses example 3:  filter is: Â  *domain.com incoming email 1 has an address of: Â  test.person@domain.com incoming email 2 has an address of: Â  thistest.person@domain.com Result: Â  Incoming email 1 and 2 Â ARE discarded as they equal the filter value of ""*domain.com"" where the wildcard (*) matches any value preceding ""domain.com""  Â  Headers/Subject/Body example 1:  filter is: Â  is incoming email 1 has an Â element of: Â  is incoming email 2 has an element Â of: Â  history incoming email 3 has an element of: Â  I need permission to access my incidents incoming email 4 has an element of: Â  This email is spam Result: Â  All 4 emails are discard as the string/text value of ""is"" is found in the element of each email. Headers/Subject/Body example 2:  filter is: Â  email is spam incoming email 1 has an element of: Â  is incoming email 2 has an element of: Â  history incoming email 3 has an element of: Â  I need permission to access my incidents incoming email 4 has an element of: Â  This email is spam Result: Â  Only email 4 IS discarded because it has the only element ""email is spam"" that matches the filter value of ""email is spam"". Headers/Subject/Body example 3:  filter is: Â  free pair incoming email 1 has an element of: Â  You won a free pair of shoes! incoming email 2 has an element of: Â  Inquiry regarding the free pair of shoes promotion Result: Â  Both emails ARE discarded as they both contain the text/string ""free pair"".  Mime Type example: To exclude MPEG video attachments, GIF images, and all audio formats, type: video/mpeg, image/gif, audio/* Note: This filter blocks only matching file attachments. The remaining contents of the email continue to process.  File Type example: To exclude all executable files, screen savers, and any script titled worm.vbs, type: *.exe, *.scr, worm.vbs Note: This filter blocks only matching file attachments. The remaining contents of the email continue to process. Note: Â  At times the Discard Filters on mailboxes may provide false-positive results. Â  It may be useful in these cases to remove the Discard Filter logic from the mailbox and create a corresponding rule that utilizes a regular expression. Â  Regular expressions provide more granular logic and can help to alleviate false-positive scenarios. Â  For more information regarding the use of rules and regular expressions, refer to the 'Business Rule Management' and 'Regular Expressions' sections in online documentation for the version your site is running. Â  For additional information on mailbox configurations, refer to the 'Adding and editing mailboxes' section.

Request to Delete an Interface;Answer ID 6505;How can we delete interfaces from our site?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 1731', 'Answer ID 7884']; Ã‚Â   All Releases,Ã‚Â Deleting Interfaces;  Previously, deleting an interface was Â an exercise in requirements gathering, scoping and data movement.  Â Post 18B release, the interface deletion exercise has been optimized and simplified. The analysis around how the data is affected is still required before proceeding with the interface deletion since all the data in the DB is interconnected and the data once deleted cannot be recovered. You will still need to work with Oracle Consulting to get the interfaces deleted by submitting all the necessary information with regards to all data you wish to keep intact, and moved within the interfaces you will be keeping. Due to the changes done in the 18B release, the interface deletion process is going to be much smoother and faster. The interface deletion process will use the bulk delete APIs behind the scenes to clean up the data in a more efficient way with minimal impact on the site. Â  To delete an interface, reach out to Oracle Consulting. Alternatively, we can just disable the interface without any effect to your site. If you wish to have an interface disabled, please submit a service request to our Support team via the Ask Technical Support Â page.

Chat completion times occur sometimes hours after chat has ended;Answer ID 6513;The chat has ended but then released a couple of minutes or hours later.Ã‚Â  Why?;['Answer ID 7831']; Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Chat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Agent Console, Workspaces  Issue  In several cases the chat handling times were off by a couple of minutes to several hours.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â In particular, the chat has ended but then released sometimes several minutes or hours later.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â This causes long wrap up times in reports and prevents agents from taking another session right away.; While a chat is in wrap up mode it will count as an active session for the agent. Â  Â This is as designed. Â  Â This means, for agents with three active sessions (i.e. maximum sessions allowed), they will not be able to accept another session until one session fully completes. Â  Â This is standard functionality to allow agents time to complete any notes or responses that need to be saved. In an associated workspace, an incident field had been added to the chat workspace and set as required. Â  Â The chat workspace was also set with a 30 second wrap up time. With this in place, as long as the required field in the chat workspace has not been set, the chat session itself cannot close. Â  Â Once the enduser disconnects the chat session, this puts the session into wrap up mode (i.e. wrap_up time is written to the chats table). Â  Â Once the required field on the chat workspace is set, the chat session can then complete. (i.e. a completed time is written to the chats table). Â  Â If this value is being set in the incident workspace, that incident needs to be saved at that time. Â  Â This action writes the incident i_id to the chats table and allows the chat to complete. To work around this behavior, there are two available options. Â  Â The first is that agents consistently set all required fields while that chat session is still active. Â  Â For example, the agent sets all required fields during the chat session and then the Customer disconnects. Â  Â With all required fields completed within the chat session, once the incident is saved and closed, the chat completes as expected. Â  Â The second option is to remove the Ã¢â‚¬ËœrequiredÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ flag from fields in the chat workspace. Â  Â Note, it can still be required on the incident workspace. With this second option in place (remove required flag), the chat session will enter wrap up mode when the enduser disconnects and 30 seconds later (wrap up time set in workspace), the session itself will complete (i.e. completed time written to database). Â  Â At the database level, the corresponding wrap_up time and completed time will correctly correspond to these events. For more information on wrap up mode, refer to Answer ID 7831: Changes to wrap-up mode in Enhanced Console.

Text area fields not available in Segments;Answer ID 6521;Why can't I include my custom text area field in my segment?;['Answer ID 5168'];  Segments, All versions; Text area fields will not be available to add to segments because they cannot be used in report filters. A segment is, essentially, a series of filters used to generate a contact list, and because text area fields cannot be used in filters they cannot be used in segments. Please note the below excerpt from product documentation: The available options in the Value field change depending on the type of field and the operator you select. For example, a menu fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s values display in a drop-down menu, whereas a date fieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s values display date and time options. Text area fields are not available for use in report filters.

Chat rules not working with ConditionalChatLink;Answer ID 6523;Our chat routing rules are not working with our ConditionalChatLink. Why?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Chat - Enduser Pages Oracle B2C Service  Issue Ã‚Â   We have routing rules in place that route based on the product selection, but all chats are going to the default queue instead.;"  Chats rules for chats submitted with ConditionalChatLink source work a bit differently. In short, when the home page first loads, the widget runs the rules. Â  Â Because there are no parameters defined at that time (i.e. within the widget), the chat is routed to the default queue. Â  Â If there are no logged in agents with access to the default queue, the conditional chat link will be unavailable. Â  Â To resolve this behavior, logged in agents must have the default queue added within their profiles. After it is clicked, the user is then on the chat_launch form. Â  Â They make their selections and hit submit. Â  Â At that point, the system already knows it has run the rules (i.e. based on the chat_data parameter in the URL being passed) so it does not run them again. Â  Â For this reason, parameters added from the chat_launch page (i.e. product value) are ignored. To resolve this second part, you can enable the ""ignore_preroute"" attribute within the conditional chat widget. This widget determines an appropriate Chat queue and agent availability for that queue based upon available information and chat routing rules. Â  Â We refer to this as the 'pre-routed' queue. Â  Â If the 'ignore_preroute' Â  Â is enabled (i.e. the attribute is set to 'true'), subsequent data captured (e.g. from the 'chat_launch') will be used for routing purposes and the chat may be assigned to a queue that is different than the pre-routed queue, which may result in unexpected wait time. Â  Â If the 'ignore_preroute' is disabled (i.e. the attribute is set to 'false'), Â  Â subsequent data captured (e.g. from the 'chat_launch') will be ignored and the chat will be placed directly into to the 'pre-routed' Â  Â queue. For more information on this attribute, please see the Documentation link from the Customer Portal Administration page: Â  Widget Documentation &gt; Standard Widgets &gt; Chat &gt; ConditionalChatLink &gt; Toggles section.

Mailbox Addresses Discard Filter character limitation;Answer ID 6527;Is there a character limit on the Addresses Discard Filter in the mailbox configuration?;['Answer ID 2345', 'Answer ID 908', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Mailboxes Oracle B2C Service;"  Â  There is a 4,000 character limit to the Addresses Discard Filter in the mailbox configuration of the CX application, and this field currently cannot be extended to additional characters. However, please note, you can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to match any characters. Â  For example, to discard Â all email from 'jsmith@example.com' and all 'example.org' addresses, type: 'jsmith@example.com,*@example.org'. Â  You might also want to review any commonalities in the email addresses to reduce some characters. There are several other options available to filter email addresses in order to prevent Spam. It is highly recommend to use the blacklist feature in the Barracuda Spam filter as the feature is the same as the Discard Addresses field that is configured for mailboxes within your CX application. You also might be able to create a business rule using something similar to: IF Â certain keywords in the email address = &lt;'value'&gt; THEN  Â 'Do Not Create Incident' See Â Answer ID 2345: Barracuda Spam filters on hosted Service mailboxes and Â Answer ID 908: Preventing spam/junk email from becoming incidents Â for further information on Barracuda Spam filtering, and configuring a rule to manage your emails.

PC (PCI) FG Masking: Incident vs Chat;Answer ID 6541;How does masking work in each environment?;['Answer ID 6316', 'Answer ID 5622', 'Answer ID 5623', 'Answer ID 6316', 'Answer ID 5168'];   PC (PCI), FG pod;"  Incidents   Masking is turned on by default in the PC (PCI) and Â FG pods using the F5 Load Balancers (the ""Application Scanning Modules"" or ""Web Application Firewalls"" in the F5s . The Â request can be made to Â turn Â it Â on or Â off. Credit Card (CC) and Social Security Number (SSN) masking are configured separately. You can enable Â or disable one or both. It will scan everything (subject, body, also including custom fields). CC and SSN masking is interface specific.  In the November 2013 and newer releases, you can enable the Â Incident Thread Masking feature to automatically mask incident thread content that matches common patterns, such as credit card, social security, and telephone Â numbers. Answer ID 6316 - Enable Incident Thread masking feature. Â   If Â the F5 or the Â Incident Thread Â Masking product feature is Â enabled, it will be masked but potentially in a different way depending on which is on. Â  If they are both on, the Â Incident Thread Masking feature would take precedence because it masks the data when stored. If neither is on it will not be masked.  With the Incident Thread Masking feature enabled, Â it masks data as it comes in and the result is stored in the database (i.e. you will see XXX-XXX-XXXX).  With F5 masking turned on, Â data remains unmasked in the database, but masked when displayed on the Customer Portal (end-user pages) or in the Oracle B2C Service administration console (i.e. looks like ****-******). Â  If you have Â Incident Thread Masking enabled, the F5 will not mask it because it will already be masked, and not match any of the masking patterns.  Chats   CC and SSN masking are configured separately. You can enable or disable one or both. When enabled in Chat, the Â mask will affect Â both Â the client Â and agent. The Â actual digits for the CC and SSN are visible to the sender and not passed through the chat. (Receiver will see the masked number ex. xxx-xx-xxxx or xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx) At the point of completion the chat is added to the incident record Â and the CC and SSN are masked permanently.  NOTE: Â It is not possible to disable masking for Chat for a particular interface, as masking for Chat is configured site wide. In order to enable or disable this functionality, a Â change request has to be made by the Primary Support Contact of your organization via a service request. The service request Â will then be escalated to our Cloud Hosting Management Team to make the change.

CSV attachments not being handled properly in incident;Answer ID 6552;We have CSV file(s) attached to emails which are sent to create incidents. Why are these files not being attached to the incident as expected or are opening up as jumbled text?;['Answer ID 2762'];  Incoming Emails, File Attachments Oracle RightNow Service;" This behavior has been seen when automated emails are being generated by an outside source and is due to the attachment being received as straight text. The issue involves the formatting of the message by the script used to generate these messages and files. There are two possible symptoms to this issue. Attachments will not be attached to the incident and will instead be pasted into the incident thread as jumbled text. Or the file will be attached to the incident however upon opening it, it's contents contain jumbled text. An incoming message needs details to identify the parts of that message Â (ie: text body part, attachment body part...). Without these boundary identifiers, techmail is taking the attachment and bringing it in as part of the email body. Here is an example where there is a text body part for the message indicating a file is attached and then a body part for the attachment with details that it is an attachment and base64 encoded.  From: email.address@adomain.com To: email.address@anotherdomain.com Subject: This is the subject for unique value (e.g., timestmap) so subject unique Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""label.boundry.1388181139"" Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2013 15:52:20 -0600 (CST) --label.boundry.1388181139 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Hello This is the email body mentioning that this email contains an attachment. and the file is named: log20131227155219.log Good day --label.boundry.1388181139 Content-Type: text/plain\; name=""log20131227155219.log"" Content-Disposition: attachment\; filename=""log20131227155219.log"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: UTF-8 --label.boundry.1388181139--   Â  To confirm whether or not the incoming messages creating these incidents are formatted correctly with the proper boundary identifiers: 1. Ensure that the EGW_SAVE_ORIG_MESSAGE configuration is enabled as per Answer ID 2762: Maintaining copies of incoming email for incident creation 2. Open the .mht file attached to the incident in a text editor and determine if the boundary identifiers are present in the original message. 3. Compare this to the .mht file used to create an incident where the CSV file was properly attached to determine if the boundary identifiers are being properly included in the message. Between the Â beginning and ending attachment boundary identifer, there will be base64 encoded content which will be for the file itself. It there is any incorrect encoded content in there, such as normal text, this will throw off the formatting of the entire file and may cause the file attachment to not be saved correctly. To resolve this issue, you will want to correct the script used to generate these messages and attachments and ensure that these boundary identifiers are being generated correctly."

Different Language Labels on Products;Answer ID 6557;Why don't my product labels match across all interfaces?;['Answer ID 2762'];  Products/Categories/Dispositions;" Products can carry different labels across different interfaces, making it appear that different products are present from one interface to another depending on language. For example, a product with the ID 555 might be called ""Cookies"" on an interface using English (US), but be called ""Biscuits"" on an interface using English (UK). The product ID is the same and any visibility and linking will still apply, but the product will appear with a different label from one interface to another. Products that have different labels based on Â language will appear with those different labels Â in both the Customer Portal and within the agent desktop. This may cause confusion if you have agents who work in multiple interfaces and are not aware that the same product carried different labels in different interfaces. Â It is important that your agents be aware of which products they should be applying on a per-Interface basis if your products have different labels based on language. If you would like to configure your products so that they have different labels based on language, or if you would like to ensure that they are configured with matching labels across interfaces, you can do so by following the below steps: 1. Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Products/Categories/Dispositions 2. Select the product you would like to modify and double click on it 3. Next to the product ""Name"" field you will see a drop down button. Click this 4. Select which language you would like to modify 5. Makes the desired change 6. Save and Close"

Product Visibility in Configuration Areas;Answer ID 6559;Why do I see my products in the Answer editor even though they should not be visible on this interface?;['Answer ID 5184', 'Answer ID 5168'];  Products, Categories, Dispositions; There are certain areas in which removing administrator visibility will not impact the availability of a product. In configuration areas where administrators might be working on the content of the site and knowledge base (such as the Product/Categories/Dispositions editor, Answer editor, and Business Rules editor) there will still be access to all products for configuration purposes, regardless of whether those products are administrator visible on the interface in which the administrator is working. Note: There is a configuration option within the answer workspace that allows administrators to limit product/category visibility. See Answer ID 5184: Limit products based on interface visibility within answer workspace for more information. Visibility will impact day to day operation within the administration desktop. For example, products that are not configured as Administrator visible will not be visible to agents within incident workspace. Product visibility will also determine Answer visibility from one interface to another.

Editing Response Requirements;Answer ID 6566;I need to edit Response Requirements. Will this result in the creation of a new version of the associated SLA?;['Answer ID 2820'];  All versions;" As a best practice we recommend not editing an SLA once the SLA has been applied to a contact, organization, or incident. This is because edits to an SLA result in the creation of a new version of the SLA but the newest version of the SLA is not automatically applied to contact, organization, or incident records. That said, please keep the following in mind when editing Response Requirements: - Time Zones (as they apply to response requirements): In order to ensure time zone values are applied correctly in regards to interface, when editing response requirements it is recommended that you log into the interface associated to the response requirements you will be editing. Â  For example, if you are logged into the console for the English interface (TZ_INTERFACE Â = PST8PDT) and want to edit the response requirements for the Â French interface (TZ_INTERFACE = Europe/Paris), it is recommended that you first log into the console for the French interface and then edit the response requirements for the French interface. Â  - Editing DEFAULT response requirements: When the default response requirements for an interface need to be modified (i.e. either the hours need to be changed or a holiday checked or unchecked) you should do so via the Response Requirements editor so that a new version of an SLA is not created: 1. Go to: Configuration --&gt; Services --&gt; Response Requirements 2. Select the interface in question 3. Make the desired change(s) 4. Select ""Save""  - Editing the CUSTOM response requirements of an existing SLA: If the response requirements of an existing SLA (i.e. one that has statistics associated to it) are edited, a new version of an SLA will be created. This occurs when the following steps are taken: 1. Go to: Configuration --&gt; Services --&gt; Service Level Agreements 2. Open the SLA in question 3. In the ""Response Requirement"" column of the Interface Label section, select ""Edit"" on the row of the desired interface 4.

Renaming a workspace field;Answer ID 6568;How do I rename a field in a workspace?;['Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   All releases, Workspaces;"  Â  You can change the text for the label of a field in a workspace by clicking on the field name, and selecting the 'Text' button in the 'Label' properties in the ribbon. Â  When changing the label for a field, the label will be highlighted when you click the Text button and you can edit the label on the design space. You can also click the label on the design space without clicking the Text button. In order to allow the use of shortcut keys (Alt + &lt;selected character&gt;), type an ampersand (&amp;) in front of the character you want to be the shortcut key. For example, to allow staff members to move the focus to a control with the label Ã¢â‚¬Å“DetailsÃ¢â‚¬Â by pressing Alt+t, type De&amp;tails. Please note: Text fields used in scripts are limited to 1,000 characters.

What is Agent Authenticator?;Answer ID 6573;What is Agent Authenticator?;['Answer ID 10050', 'Answer ID 5169'];   Agent Authenticator;"  When Connect PHP API Â receives a request, access control measures are enforced. First, Oracle RightNow CX Â configuration is checked to ensure the API has been enabled at a site level. Second, the user credentials supplied in the applicable authentication function are validated. Authenticating with Connect PHP Â API Â is slightly different based on the Â access point Â you are using. When using the process designer and analytics access points, authentication is automatically initiated by the Oracle RightNow CX Â platform, whereas the file manager access point must be authenticated by calling the Â AgentAuthenticator.phph Â script and the customer portal access point must be authenticated by calling the Â Connect_init.php Â script. This is done behind the scenes for CP. For further information see Answer ID 10050: Using Connect_init.php in Customer Portal The reason that authentication scripts must be called for both the file manager and the customer portal access points is because they contain customer-facing pages that cannot be automatically authenticated by the Oracle RightNow CX Â platform. The standardized libraries protect custom PHP pages from unauthorized use, improving the security of customer sites and reducing the overall cost of site upgrades.   There are several methods available including AgentAuthenticator::authenticateSessionID. The following example code illustrates the use of this method: try {  Â  Â  Â  Â if (!defined('DOCROOT')) {  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â $docroot = get_cfg_var('doc_root');  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â define('DOCROOT', $docroot);  Â  Â  Â  Â }  Â  Â  Â  Â /************* Agent Authentication ***************/  Â  Â  Â  Â // Set up and call the AgentAuthenticator  Â  Â  Â  Â require_once (DOCROOT .

Report Columns conditionally formatted with an image are blank when exported to Excel or CSV;Answer ID 6580;When exporting a report to Excel or CSV, and the report contains a conditional format that replaces text with an image, why does exporting to Excel or CSV result in blank cells?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Exporting reports Oracle B2C Service, All versions;  This is expected behavior. When the report is exported it exports the display value Â  Â (image) of the column and not the raw value (text) of the column definition. As images cannot be displayed in text type documents (i.e. Excel or .csv) the images are stripped when exported to text type files. However, if you copy the report and edit the conditional formatting you can replace the images with 'Text Only', which will display as 'xxx' on the file you exported. Â  You must also uncheck the 'Include cell images' in the export options of your report. Â  You can edit the conditional formatting by following the steps below: 1. Â  right click on the column in the report. 2. Â  select 'Edit Format'. 3. Â  select the 'Conditional' tab. 4. Â  click 'Edit'. 5. Â  click the 'Format' tab.

There are two types of execution for Object Event Handlers;Answer ID 6604;What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous execution of Object Event Handlers in the custom process?;['Answer ID 7883', 'Answer ID 9453', 'Answer ID 6907'];   Process Designer, Custom Process Model (CPM) / Service Process Model (SPM) November 2013 version and newer;  Synchronous execution of an Object Event Handler has a strict time limit of 5 seconds. It is intended for processes that are executed without interruption from start to finish. Synchronous execution of an Object Event handler requires the code executing it to wait until the handler is completed to continue execution. Asynchronous execution of an Object Event Handler has a time limit of 157 seconds of processing time, execution is controlled by a queuing system. If there is a failure to execute the first time, the process can be repeated up to four times. Retry intervals increase over time (from 90,450, 3150, and 34,650 seconds respectively). The goal is to ensure that the resources needed for execution are available. Asynchronous execution is intended for event handlers that do not need to execute immediately. An example that may use asynchronous execution could be an integration that updates contact information in an external database when a contact is created in Oracle RightNow CX. Asynchronous execution is anticipated for Object Event Handlers that have been created to replace External Events. To set the event handler to execute asynchronously, select the Execute Asynchronously check box and/or name the handler with the async keyword. This needs to be done before a CPM customization is first saved, since this aspect of the configuration is non-editable for existing CPM customizations. For details on how to delete a CPM customization see Answer ID 7883: Delete Custom Process Model Script (CPM) For more information, refer to the following: Answer ID 9453: Two second guideline for synchronous CPMs Answer ID 6907: Limitations of synchronous object event handlers when attached to the answer object.

If an external event takes 20 seconds to complete, then the custom process will be delayed by 20 seconds. If the business rule executes an external event that takes 10 seconds, then it will be 10 seconds before the normal (non-rule-executed) external events run.

Creating a custom report of all incidents that have ever been assigned to a specific status;Answer ID 6609;How do IÃ‚Â create a custom report of all incidents that have ever been assigned to a specific status?;['Answer ID 906', 'Answer ID 2611', 'Answer ID 5168'];   Analytics, Custom Report;"  Â  Most of the specific changes to a record are not recorded, however, the only specific changes that are stored are found in the 'trans_type' field of the Â 'transactions' table. Â Please note, you can only see values if they are a preset 'trans_type' stored in the 'transactions' table, if it is not in there, it is not configurable. Most preset 'trans_type' are a generic edit type which do not contain exactly what was changed. You might want to review some basic examples using the 'Incident Audit Log' (ID 9041), or 'Contact Audit Log' (ID 9050) standard reports. You also might be able to create a custom report using the 'transactions' table and the 'Attribute' field. The 'transactions' table stores much, but not all, of the information that is seen in the audit log of an incident. For instance, the 'trans_type' field will store the different types of transactions that can occur, such as a status change. The 'id1' field will give the you the ID value of the status that the incident was changed to. Unfortunately, it can only store the ID value of a status and not the actual name. But you can find the IDs of your status by following the detailed steps provided below: 1. Navigate to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Customizable Menus 2. System Menus &gt; Incident Statues 3. Hover over the label for the status and give it about 5 to 10 seconds and the ID number should pop up. The 'Attribute' field of the 'transactions' table is dependant on many different factors and how your report is designed. It varies depending on the transaction type and the type of record or item the transac Â­tion is associated with. For example, if you are referring to incident statuses, you might want to use the 'transaction_type = Status changed' filter which is transaction_type 6. When looking at the 'Attribute 1 (id1)' field you can see it could be referring to 'statuses.status_id where transactions.trans_type = 6'. I think if you review the Data Dictionary in regards to the 'transactions' table and the 'Attribute 1 (id1)', you will start to see the pattern it uses. You can find further details on using the 'transactions' table and the Data Dictionary in reports Â by referring to Â Answer ID 906: Transaction fields in custom reports Â and Answer ID 2611: Accessing the data dictionary.

The code in the add-ins contains IGlobalContext to obtain an IAutomationcontext reference. Using IGlobalContext.IAutomationContext to subscribe and unsubscribe to events can cause unsubscribe events to not be handled by the framework. This is the correct flow, however there is a slight caveat. Everytime IGlobalContext.IAutomationContext is used a new AddInSideAdapter will be created to reference the AutomationContext. In practice, you wire up the event like this:  IGlobalContext.AutomationContext.CurrentEditorTabChanged += eventHandler; IGlobalContext.AutomationContext.CurrentEditorTabChanged -= eventHandler;  In this example, you are not actually unwiring the event in the second line that you wired up in the first line. IGlobalContext.AutomationContext is not static nor a singleton.";" The proper way to do this would be to set your AutomationContext to a local variable to ensure that you are always referencing the same object. For example: private IAutomationContext intitialAutomationContext; intitialAutomationContext = globalContext.AutomationContext; intitialAutomationContext .CurrentEditorTabChanged += eventHandler; intitialAutomationContext .CurrentEditorTabChanged -= eventHandler; In this case the event will be unsubscribed properly.

Polish customer gets error when requesting a chat;Answer ID 6656;Why didÃ‚Â a Polish customer get a 'requested URL rejected' error when they requested a chat?;['Answer ID 768'];" Ã‚Â  PC Pod Sites - Chat Issue  One of our Polish customers received this error when they requested a chat:  ""The requested URL was rejected. Please consult with your administrator. Your support ID is: (string of numbers)""";" This error occurs when the chat launch URL is appended with an email address which ends in "".pl"". The URLs used by our product differentiate between parameters with a '/' which results in the URL appearing like a file path if a '.pl' email address is entered. This causes a conflict when security software interprets the URL appended with Â the Polish email address as a 'perl' type file. Due to security precautions, the '.pl' file extension has been blocked to prevent unauthorized execution of perl files via a URL address. To avoid this error, change the order of the parameters in the chat link so that the email parameter is not last in the URL. For example, change: https://yoursitename.custhelp.com/app/chat/chat_landing/first_name/Bob/last_name/Consumer/email/emailaddress%40domain.pl to: https://yoursitename.custhelp.com/app/chat/chat_landing/email/emailaddress%40domain.pl/first_name/Bob/last_name/Consumer/  "

Incident Thread Masking is not working;Answer ID 6657;I've enabled Incident Thread Masking, why isn't it working?;['Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â   Service Incident Thread Masking November 2013 and newer releases;"  In order for Incident Thread Masking to take effect, the following must be done:  The feature must be enabled. Contact your Oracle account manager for entitlement of this feature. Note: Â  Â Once this feature is enabled on a site, Â system masks such as Â credit card, ssn and phone number Â are automatically enabled and Â will start to mask immediately. Â  However, if you find it is not, continue checking the following steps. Mask(s) must be enabled in the Incident Thread Masking configuration window Changes to configurations must be Saved Masks must be Deployed  Path: Â  Configuration &gt; Service &gt; Incident Thread Masking When testing Custom Masks, the System Mask may actually be applied before the Custom Mask. Â  Â Note the following precedences in how masking is applied to the data.  System Masks have precedence over Custom Masks when evaluating data. Within System Masks the order of precedence in evaluating data is: Credit Card, SSN, Phone Number. Custom masks cannot be configured to display only some of the digits. The mask applies to all the data matching the custom mask. When testing Credit Card System Masks, be sure to use valid test credit card numbers. The masking tool uses Luhn algorithm (checksum formula) to identify credit card numbers. Thread masking does not work with randomly selected credit card numbers. Here are some examples of valid test credit card numbers:       Number  Card type       4242424242424242  Visa     5555555555554444  MasterCard     378282246310005  American Express     6011111111111117  Discover     30569309025904  Diners Club     3530111333300000  JCB    It is also possible for the System Credit Card Masking tool to mask numbers that are not credit card numbers if they meet the criteria. Numbers will be masked if the pattern passes the Luhn Algorithm test and the number is in one of the following formats: #### #### #### #### or Â ####-####-####-#### #### ###### ##### or Â ####-######-##### Numbers can be entered with or without dashes. or 12-16 consecutive digits.

Archiving incidents on test or upgrade sites;Answer ID 6658;Can I enable incident archiving as a test on a non-production site?;['Answer ID 7940'];   All versions, incident archiving;  Although it is useful to Â archive a few incidents Â on a test site, there is nothing to be gained by Â enabling archiving to run continuously. Â  Production and test sites are different enough that performance is not comparable between site types. Â  Also, test sites are often refreshed with production data which will write over any archiving that has occurred. Â  Lastly, since there is no business case for it, the only result of archiving on a test site is load on our servers. However, Â Technical Support will gladly configure and run archiving once to archive some incidents that can be viewed Â in the Archived Incidents report on a test site. Â  Note that only the oldest closed incidents will be archived. Â  Unfortunately there is no way to archive specific incidents or ranges of incidents by date or any other filter. Please also see Answer 7940: Archived incidents cannot be opened in the test or upgrade site.

Upgrade site sends wrong auto response;Answer ID 6674;Why is the standard text auto response different in my upgrade site?;['Answer ID 2611', 'Answer ID 5168']; Ã‚Â  Business Rules, Standard Text Response Messaging Upgrade from May 2011 and prior;  The incident thread control previously available for incident workspaces has been replaced with a new Rich Text Incident Thread control. The redesigned control introduces several helpful features, including the ability to apply basic HTML formatting to incident thread text. Â  Â If a standard text value is available in both Text and HTML, the Rich Text Incident Thread control uses the HTML value by default. While reviewing standard text, note any values that have different content between the Text and HTML fields. For example, the $solutions variable may be in the HTML content but not in the Text content. For standard text entries that have differences between the Text and HTML values, you must now use two different standard texts: one that uses the value of the HTML in both the Text and HTML fields and the other that uses the value of the Text in both the Text and HTML fields. When creating standard text, we recommend that the value used in the Text and HTML fields be the same, although there may be additional formatting in the HTML field. We also recommend that you review any business rules that append standard text responses to make sure the correct values will be appended based on any modifications made to your standard text. This action is especially important if you use a single rule to display one piece of content on the customer portal when customers submit incidents and then append other content to incident threads when responding to customers. You must break the single rule out into two rules as follows. First Rule: If Incident.Source equals SmartAssistant on Ask a Question, Then Append Response Template to Notes or Response Field. (The HTML value of the standard text displays, but is not appended to the incident.) Second Rule: If Incident.Source equals Ask a Question, Then Append Response Template to Notes or Response Field. (The HTML value of the standard text is appended to the thread in the incident.)

Email address used for contacts created from email messages;Answer ID 6677;What address is used for the contact record if the From and Reply-to address of the incoming email are different?;['Answer ID 966'];  Oracle B2C Service, Incoming Emails, Contact Records Issue  A customer sends in an email which createsÃ‚Â a contact record and anÃ‚Â incident. The From and Reply-to address of the message are different.Ã‚Â  In this scenario, we are unsure which address will be used in the contact record.;" The product determines the email address to associate to the contact record based on precedence. The order of precedence is to ""Reply-to"", ""From"" and ""Sender."" If there is a Reply-to address in the message, then this will be associated to the contact record and have precedence over the From and Sender. The intent is that if a contact sends a message and has intentionally configured the Reply-to address to be different than the From address, the contact Â would expect an email response to be sent to the Reply-to address rather than the From address. Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the precedence or configure the product to associate one address over the other.

Limits of Synchronous Object Event handlers with respect to network calls;Answer ID 6702;Can I use a remote network call in a synchronous custom process?;['Answer ID 9453', 'Answer ID 6604', 'Answer ID 6840'];November 2012 and newer releases, Process Designer, Custom Processes;" When researching Â converting an external event to a custom process please note external events that call out over the network are poor candidates for migrations to synchronous custom processes. The reason for this is that changes in network environments can cause timeouts which if they occur repeated will cause a cascading failure. Repeated failures will cause the SPM to be automatically disabled. A typical example of a cascading failure of this type is an object event handler attached to the creation of an incident. This handler will be called during techmail Â each time Â an incident is created. There is a processing limit of 5 seconds for this operation, if the network response has not been returned in the allotted time it is possible that the failure of the object event handler will impact the running of mail processor and ultimately Â  techmail -s, if the failure Â were not noticed quickly techmail -s could be placed in no-utils. This would have a significant business impact for most users. It is possible to convert some of these types of external events to asynchronous processes, but the user must not have a need for ""real-time"" processing as there is no guarantee on the immediacy of the processing of the request.

Staging looks different than Development after Promoting!;Answer ID 6737;Why does theÃ‚Â staging environmentÃ‚Â look different than theÃ‚Â development environment, even after promoting the Customer Portal page to staging?;['Answer ID 6707'];  Customer Portal  Issue  The development area may not always look the same as the staging environment area because the code is not being optimized yet.; When you are in the development Â area because the code is not optimized, you might see a difference between what is showing in the development environment Â compared to what is showing in the staging environment even after staging your changes. Â  Â  In most cases that will not be a factor and the view between the development environment and the staging environment Â should look the same. One possible reason development mode might not look the same as staging is when there is an issue with the styling that will only manifest itself with the optimization code. To get a clear and accurate answer of what Â  Â your view will look like when making changes and testing, it is better to use what you see in the staging environment Â after staging Â as an indicator of what you will see in production environment because the staging Â environment uses optimized code. Once you are happy with how the staging environment looks you can promote your changes.

When submitting logs showing the error, please have Â your logs report GMT time, it will make the comparison to our system logs easier. 2. When the error is occurring, attempt to run a Fiddler capture of the error.  FiddlerCap can be downloaded at http://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddlercap Instructions to run FiddlerCap: 1. Install FiddlerCap 2. Start 'FiddlerCap' 3. Select 'Decrypt HTTPS traffic...' and install certificate if prompted (**Important - if this step is skipped the results will not be useful**) 4. Click 'Start Capture' 5. Start RightNow and work normally until an error occurs 6. In FiddlerCap, click the 'Snapshot' button to embed a screenshot of the error into the results 7.

In the 'copy' step, all details are pulled from the original record as-is. Â  Â This is expected behavior. The new incident does not exist at the database level at that point. It only exists as a placeholder in the agent's console. Â  Â  The save action is what creates the record in the database and when all the details are written to the database. Â  Â With that Save action, all standard date fields are set correctly with the current date/time (or cleared as appropriate). Note that custom date field values are copied as-is. Custom field values will not change when an incident is copied. Â  Â This is the intended functionality. Once the incident is saved, all thread entries of the copied incident will become associated to the agent making the copy. Other details such as status or assigned will be copied from the original record. Â  Â This is also as expected since the action being performed is a ""copy"". Â  Â However, if you wish to work around this, you can create either workspace or business rules that set these values accordingly when an incident is created from the console. Â  Â For example, the rule could set the status to ""Unassigned"" where source is CX console."

Proactive Chat widget cookie;Answer ID 6794;Why does the Proactive Chat widget only present itself to the end user once?;['Answer ID 1104', 'Answer ID 6500'];  Proactive Chat Widget; The proactive chat widget by design will set a cookie on the end user's browser once a chat offer has been presented. This is by design to prevent end users from continually getting chat offers each time they visit the same page. If you are testing the functionality of this widget, you will need to clear your cookies each time, in order to get the proactive chat to trigger repeatedly. Chat sessions are not offered in the following situations: If the customerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s browser does not accept cookies, no chat is offered during the customer session. If the widget looks for a chat queue ten times without finding one, no chat is offered on that page. If a chat is offered (whether or not it is accepted), a cookie is set and no more chat offers are made during the current customer session. If a chat is offered and the customer refuses, a cookie is set and no more chat offers are made for 30 days.

The actions in any section are appended in the order they are added, without the possibility to reorder them without being removed. The Transition State actions are final actions, in the sense that no other action can be added after them. The Transition States assure the item under analysis is passed on to another state. To add another action to the Then section, which ends in a Transition State, the following steps need to be followed: 1. Make note of the state where the Transition State action is pointing (this will be needed when the Transition State action will be re-added later on); 2. Remove the Transition State action (check the delete action checkmark on the right of the action); 3. Add any other required actions to the Then section of the rule; 4.

Emails filtered due to auto-responder;Answer ID 6850;How can I resolve emails being filtered due to being flagged as an auto responder?;['Answer ID 1595', 'Answer ID 2489'];   Incoming email, filters, techmail;"  To find why an email has been filtered due to status of auto-responder you need the header of the message as it is received by our servers.  You can add a rejected email address Â in a mailbox to get the original message of all filtered emails. Â  A copy of all filtered messages will be forwarded to the address added to the ""Send Rejected Messages To"" in the mailbox setup. Inspect the header of the email and compare it to the regular expression listed in the EGW_AR_CONS_BODY_FLTR, EGW_AR_MODR_BODY_FLTR, EGW_AR_AGGR_BODY_FLTR, EGW_AR_CONS_HEAD_FLTR, EGW_AR_MODR_HEAD_FLTR, or EGW_AR_AGGR_HEAD_FLTR configurations. You may find it useful to add the regular expression and the mail header to an automated REGEX checker. If your version of CX contains a tm_filter_details table, you can also create a report to show filter details by email address. Â  Â The is evident when the Â filter reason is techmail_filter_autoresponse and the description contains either ""filter by header"" or ""filter by body"". To allow these, either change your Discard Automatic Responses setting in the mailbox or edit the configuration to remove the part of the regular expression that is causing the filter. Cause: Text in a header or body of an email can cause the message to be filtered depending on the values of the EGW_AR_*_*_FLTR configurations. For example: The term ""X-LOOP"" is added to headers to prevent auto reply loops. If this term is added to an email header it may be filtered depending on the setting in ""Send Rejected Messages To"". Â  The aggressive filter contains the following regular expression to find any text containing ""x-loop:"": /^(X-Loop:)|(X-Loop-?detect):/. Therefore, if a mail administrator added that flag to a header because a reply would be automatically replied to Â the email message could be filtered. This is strictly not a case in which the flag should be used. In this case the automatic reply should have the ""X-LOOP:"" flag added not the original email."

Â  The column can be hidden so it does not display. Â  The Automatically Apply Primary Filter will Â be checked by default when you insert the report in the message. Cause: The reason is due to the rows that are returned in the report may not be unique. Â The analytics engine will automatically add the unique index when the rows are unique, whether they are hidden or not. Â  Â If the report can return multiple records based on the filter, Â it is necessary to add the key value as a column in the report. Â  An example would be returning Â incident data for a customer where the customer could have multiple incidents. Â  In this case, you would need to include the unique key for incidents, i.e. Â incidents.i_id. You can review answer Â Dynamic Merge Reports Â for additional information on other primary key filters.

However, after around 2 minutes, theÃ‚Â end userÃ‚Â is being logged out, potentially while he/she is in the middle of submitting an incident on the ask page.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â ;"  Customer Portal login Â data is stored in the contacts table. Â Contact passwords can expire. The expiration settings can be configured Â here: Defining Customer Password Requirements When a password expires, the default behavior is: The end user will try to log in with the expired password. The out-of-the-box login form widget (standard/login/LoginForm2) will grant the user a special 2-minute cp_profile cookie and redirect him/her to the password reset page (defined by the configuration verb CP_CHANGE_PASSWORD_URL). The user then has 2 minutes to reset his/her password and submit the reset request from that page, at which point the user will be granted a normal cp_profile cookie with the expected expiration time (defined by the configuration verb CP_LOGIN_COOKIE_EXP). The above problem can occur if you have customized the LoginForm widget and have not preserved the functionality to handle an ""expired password"" response from the server.

Consequently, they will be inexplicably (in their eyes anyway) logged out after 2 minutes. The proper way to resolve this is to update your custom login form widget to handle the ""forceRedirect"" parameter appropriately."

The first step requires the customer to request that Service Collaboration be provisioned for their Oracle B2C Service site. To request this provisioning: Prerequisites:  Upgrade to August 2014 release or later must be complete and accepted (Service Collaboration is only available on August 2014 release and newer) Your site must have the Service Cloud Enterprise or the Enterprise Contact Center license You must be using the new Enhanced Service Console to utilize the collaboration workspace controls Service Collaboration is not currently available on the PC and FG pod.

Configure Agent Desktop for Collaboration;Answer ID 6904;How do we Configure Agent Desktop for Collaboration?;['Answer ID 6902', 'Answer ID 2059', 'Answer ID 6905'];   August 2014 and newer releases;"  This is the Â second step required in Requesting and Setting up Service Collaboration. Following are steps required to utilize the collaboration service from within Agent Desktop. Each step is detailed below. Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  Â A. Deploy Social Business Object Definition for Incident to Oracle Social Network  The first step in preparing Agent Desktop for Collaboration requires deploying the Incident Social Business Object (SBO) Definition to the Oracle Social Network (OSN) Collaboration Service. In order to collaborate on an Incident, it must be ""shared"" from Agent Desktop to Â Oracle Social Network. The Incident SBO Definition provides OSN with the specifications of what Service Cloud incidents look like, what languages are supported, and prepares OSN to accept shared incidents and show them to OSN users. To deploy the social business object definition, you must login to Agent Desktop as the user 'administrator' and navigate to Configuration &gt; Site Â Configuration &gt; Collaboration. See Figure 1. Important: Only the system-defined Â 'administrator' user has the privileges required to deploy the incident SBO definition to Oracle Social Network, so you must be logged in as the user 'administrator' to perform this action. For more information on this account, please see Answer ID 2059: Oracle B2C Service System Administrator account.  Figure 1: Deploy Collaboration - Incident Social Business Object Definition Page Once on the page show in Figure 1, you should see the Deployment Status for Incident as 'Never Deployed' to Oracle Social Network. Push the button labeled ""Deploy Incident Collaboration"" and the Deployment Status, Deployment Date, and Default Languages should all be populated, showing successful deployment of the Incident SBO definition.   Â B. Enable Collaboration on Profile(s)  The next step is to enable collaboration on profiles of each user expected to collaborate from within Agent Desktop; this may be all the profiles/users you have set up. Enabling collaboration on the user profile ensures that when the user logs in to Agent Desktop, the system connects to the Oracle Social Network Collaboration Service to ensure notifications are received and that the collaboration controls and reports will be able to connect to the service. To enable collaboration on the user profile you will need to log in with the system-defined administrator password, navigate to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles as shown in Figure 2. For each profile you wish to be able to use the collaboration solution,  choose permissions in the Ribbon button navigate to the Service Tab under the Incidents section, check the ""Collaboration"" permission box save the profile   Figure 2: Enable Collaboration for Profile This should be repeated for any profiles that are expected to collaborate on incidents from within Agent Desktop.   Â C. Configure Incident Workspace(s) for Collaboration  Once the profile(s) are enabled for collaboration, the next step is to configure the Incident Workspace(s) for those profiles with the collaboration control and/or ribbon button. This will provide the actual collaboration functionality to users on their incident workspace. There are two items that can be added to the incident workspace - Â  The Collaborate ribbon button, and the Collaboration control. In order for the user to have collaboration functionality available, at least one of these items (preferably both) must be added to the incident workspace.  The collaboration control is a related item that can be dragged and dropped onto the incident workspace, much like the message thread (see figure 3) The collaboration ribbon button is a ribbon button available to be added to the Incident Ribbon, for example under ""Related Activities"" (see figure 4) If only the control is added to the workspace but the ribbon button is not, users will need to manually find/navigate to the collaboration control on the workspace in order to collaborate. If only the ribbon button is added to the incident workspace, but the control is not, clicking on the button will bring up the incident control in a popup window. If both items are added to the incident workspace, clicking the Collaborate button will navigate the user to the Collaboration Control on the workspace.   Figure 3: Adding the Collaboration Control to the Incident Workspace    Figure 4: Adding the Collaborate Ribbon Button to the Incident Workspace.   Â D. [Optional] Add Component Report to Navigation Sets  The final step in preparing Agent Desktop for collaboration is to expose the My Incident Conversations report to users that would like to use it. My Incident Conversations is a special component report, not editable in Analytics, because of its unique functionality. When a user executes the My Incident Conversations report, the system retrieves open conversations from Oracle Social Network, and combines that information with the Incidents with which each conversation is associated. The user is then able to judge which conversations require attention, based on both incident related date (e.g. Severity or Time to SLA), and aspects about the conversation like when it was last updated. When editing a Navigation set, the My Incident Conversations component report can be found under Components &gt; Common &gt; My Incident Conversations as shown in Figure 5.  Figure 5: Adding My Incident Conversations Report to Navigation Set   Â  In the next answer, step 3, we discuss how to Updating User Settings and Preferences."

Update User Settings and Preferences for Oracle Social Network profile;Answer ID 6905;How do we Update User Settings and Preferences for our Oracle Social Network profile?;['Answer ID 6902'];  August 2014 and newer releases;" This is the Â third step required in Requesting and Setting up Service Collaboration. Once the collaboration service is setup, we highly recommend users add a profile picture to their Oracle Social Network (OSN) Â profile, and you may optionally choose to have users set their Toast Notification Preferences with Agent Desktop. To add a profile picture to your Oracle Social Network Profile: Adding a profile picture to your profile ensures other users can see your photo when they view messages and makes for a more engaging experience. We highly recommend every user adds a profile photo as one of their first steps in using the service: Login to OSN via web browser using your Agent Desktop credentials click on your username or photo area in the upper right, which takes you to your user wall page from your user wall, hover the mouse pointer over the picture on the left and click the ""Change"" button that appears use the file browser to upload the photo file, crop as desired, and save your profile  Figure 6: Adding a Photo to your Oracle Social Network profile  Â  To Set Collaboration Toast preferences: To bring someone's attention to a request for help, users flag other users on messages which require attention. Similar to the way a user receives a toast notification when an Incident is assigned, Service Collaboration will pop-up a toast notification when a flag is assigned to a user in Oracle Social Network. Toast notifications are generated for flags on messages in conversations related to Incidents in OSN. Oracle Social Network provides three different types of flags on messages: FYI / For Your Information Please Reply Please Reply - Urgent The user has the option to decide which flags will generate toast notifications - for example, in some cases a user may not wish to be interrupted merely for FYI flag types, or perhaps the user only wants to receive a toast notification when an Urgent Reply is requested of them. The user has the option to change which flags generate toast notifications under File &gt; Options &gt; Personal Settings in the Agent Desktop application. Choose the drop down for ""Collaboration Toast Notifications"" and ensure only those flag types that should generate notifications are checked.

Limitations of synchronous object event handlers when attached to the answer object.;Answer ID 6907;Why is my custom process synchronous object event handler occasionallyÃ‚Â failing to save an answer?;['Answer ID 6902'];  AugustÃ‚Â 2012 and newer versions, Custom Processes; Note: Synchronous custom processes were introduced in August 2012. Asynchronous custom processes were introduced in August 2013. When a synchronous object event handler is attached to Â the answer object which has been either newly created or updated, there is work that must be done using answer phrases. This work takes place synchronously (other code waits for this work to complete). Depending on the load on the interface from the custom process, external events and the console and the object event handler Â may occasionally encounter a lock wait that can cause a timeout. This wait can delay the completion of the handler's work within the 5 second processing time limit. This lock will not cause an error in the error log, as it may complete before the signal Â  Â is sent to the process to terminate it. A solution to this situation occurs when using a later version of our product. We recommend upgrading to August 2013 or Â newer versions which support the use of asynchronous execution of object event handlers. Asynchronous execution of object event handlers have a longer processing limit that will Â accommodate the delay mentioned above.

Contact details are not immediately visible for transactional surveys triggered by a chat ending;Answer ID 6912;Why are survey contact details not visible immediately after a survey is submitted from a chat?;['Answer ID 6902'];   Chat, Transactional Surveys, Advanced Mode, Customer Portal (CP);"  If a chat survey in advanced mode is using a &lt;create Incident&gt; command, the incident does not get created if the chat end-user was not logged into CP before submitting the chat. If the end-user is not logged into the CP when initiating the chat, the survey at the end of the chat will not be associated to the contact until the agedatabase utility performs its daily run. Since the survey response is not linked to the contact when it is submitted, the create Incident action set in the advanced survey mode cannot be completed, as Contact ID is a required field for an incident. In the following cases, the c_id will be available in the session, and hence will be updated in the question_sessions table immediately.  If the contact uses the login page and logs into the CP pages, and then initiates a chat session.  Or   If the contact is using Pass Through Authentication (PTA)."

SmartAssistant not displaying in incident workspace;Answer ID 6913;Why is SmartAssistant not appearing?;['Answer ID 6902'];  SmartAssistant May 2012 and newer releases; When your customers conduct a search, the answers are returned in the report that is identified in the code for the Answers page (/answers/list.php). By knowing what report is being used, Oracle Â Service Cloud Â can correctly use answer clustering, SmartAssistant, and external document indexing to return the appropriate answers. However, the report you specify in Customer Portal code is not stored where the knowledge base can use it. As a result, you need to identify the report on the Interfaces editor so the knowledge base knows wha treport you want to use on your customer portal. If you use the standard Answers page, the default report is AnswersÃ¢â‚¬â€œComplex Expression Search Default, which is also the default report on the Interfaces editor. If thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the case, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to change anything. But if you change the report used on your customer portal, you must also change the Contact Visible Answers Report on the Interfaces editor so the knowledge base returns the correct answers. Follow the steps below to change you Contact Visible Answers Report: 1  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Log in to Oracle B2C Service. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   Â  Â  2  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Click the Configuration button on the navigation pane. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   Â  Â  3  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Double-click Interfaces under Site Configuration. The Interfaces tree displays on the content pane. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   Â  Â  4  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Click the interface you want to edit in the tree. (You may have just one interface.) The Interfaces editor opens. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   Â  Â  5  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Click the Contact Visible Answers Report drop-down menu, and select the report you are using from the menu options.

Cross-site email management use case;Answer ID 6922;What is the intended use for cross-site email management?;['Answer ID 6902'];  August 2014 and newer releases, Cross-site email management; This implementation is meant to support two businesses, B-to-B, that use the Oracle B2C Service product.  Â The intention is not to support the transfer of an incident from one site to another. Note: Both sites need to be running the August 2014+ version of Oracle B2C Service for cross-site email management to work. For this functionality to work, the originating email must come from a Oracle B2C Service Â instance and that email needs to land in a mailbox that is popped by the techmail utility in another Oracle B2C Service instance. Use case: We have customers who use the product to track issues that they have logged as service requests with other companies. Â  Â For instance, I run a global fashion company and need my shipments arriving on time to meet my distributorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needs. Â  Â I get a call saying the shipment didn't come in so I use my Oracle B2C Service instance to create a ticket saying Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwhat happened to the shipment?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢. Â  Â It is a bit odd because generally you would be going to the distributorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s site to log that ticket. Â  Â However, the customer wants the full history of this interaction so they are using Oracle B2C Service for outgoing incidents. Â  Â In this case, the email address associated with this incident is going to be something like fastshipping_customer_service@custhelp.com. Â  Â They create the incident and then send a response, when that email goes to that custhelp address, it just so happens that the shipping company also uses the Oracle B2C Service product. Â  Â So, it will create an incident in that instance of Oracle B2C Service and the Ã¢â‚¬ËœcontactÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will be the mailbox of the first Oracle B2C Service site. Â  Â At this point, when the shipping company sends a response, techmail on the fashion site will realize that the email came from a separate Oracle B2C Service instance. Â  Â In the past, we would have always created a new incident on every subsequent response. Â  Â Now, there is a handshake between the two systems that keeps track of the separate reference numbers so the conversation remains in a single incident on both sites. This exchange between two Oracle B2C Service sites is considered a conversation and so each thread will contain the entire contents of every email exchange.

Workgroups for the Enhanced Console;Answer ID 6923;How do parent-child records / workgroups function in the Enhanced service console?;['Answer ID 5168'];   May 2014 and newer releases, Enhanced Service Console;  Oracle B2C Service helps you manage multiple open records without confusion by grouping all associated records into a single workgroup. Workgroups apply to incidents, answers, campaigns, contacts, contact lists, documents, mailings, opportunities, organizations, surveys, and tasks. When you open any type of record and then open other records associated with the initial record, you create a workgroup. If a record opens in a workgroup and you Save or Save and Close, all records in the workgroup are saved.    Each time you add or edit an additional record, it opens on a sub-tab and becomes part of the workgroup. You can move between records by clicking on the sub-tabs. The sub-tab contains buttons: OK, Cancel, and Undock. All sub-tabs, except for the primary record contain these buttons for taking actions on the individual record within the workgroup.  OK - Clicking this button accepts changes made to the record and closes the sub-tab. However, it does not save changes to the database until you click the Save or Save and Close button on the ribbon. Cancel - Clicking this button closes the sub-tab if you haven't made changes to the record. If you have made changes, a message asks if you want to discard your changes. Undock - Clicking this button undocks the record from the editor and opens it in a new window. It remains in the workgroup. You can move between working in the window and working with other records in the workgroup without closing the window. (To re-dock the window to the editor, click the Dock button on the window.)  Note: If you do not have Edit permissions for the original record, we simply cannot allow you to save it. So, when another record is opened from within the original record it is opened in a new tab/workgroup. For example, you open a contact record, but do not have permission to edit the contact record. From the contact record you go to the incidents tab and open an incident. Since you have permission to edit incidents, the incident opens in a new tab/workgroup. For additional information, refer to the 'Creating and using workgroups' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running. To access Oracle B2C Service manuals and documentation online, refer to the Documentation for Oracle B2C Service Products.

Open existing record from separate workgroup setting is ignored;Answer ID 6924;Why is the 'Open existing record from separate workgroup' setting ignored?;['Answer ID 5168'];"   May 2014 and newer releases, Specific to the Enhanced Service Console  Issue   When I doÃ‚Â NOT select the ""Open Existing Records in Separate Workgroup"" setting of the report control on a workspace, the records are nevertheless opened in separate tabs/workgroups. I believe the setting is ignored by the system.";  This behavior is Â related to profile permissions and is by design. Records Â in a workgroup are saved in a single operation if you click the Save or Save and Close button. So if a record opens in the same workgroup and you save, all records in the workgroup are saved. However, Â an account Â may be assigned to a Â profile that does not have Edit permissions to the Â original record type so we simply cannot allow the account to save it. In this situation Â the other record is opened in a new tab/workgroup. This behavior is most commonly seen with Contacts and Incidents records. For example, Â an account is assigned a profile that Â does not Â have permission to edit contacts, but they do have permissions to Â edit incidents. If the account opens a contact record and then goes to the Incidents tab and opens an incident record Â the incident record is opened in a new tab/workgroup.

"Submitting ""Hello World"" examples of customizations for defect analysis";Answer ID 6925;I think there is a defect in the customization portion of the software, how should I prepare my question to be submitted to technical support?;['Answer ID 6928'];   Customizations Oracle B2C Service, All versions;"  This answer describes how best to communicate about a potential defect in the Oracle B2C Service product to the technical support group. Customization of any sort is usually a complicated process, as there are many opportunities and dependencies that can affect the outcome. Technical support and development groups are optimized to work with issues that are clearly defined and can be reproduced consistently. How can you, the consumer of the product, best define your support question in order to have the most rapid response and resolution?  Â  In our world we refer to this type of example as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello World!Ã¢â‚¬Â example. For those who have some experience in scripting; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello World!Ã¢â‚¬Â is the first program or script a new user would write. It is simply a script that will display the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello WorldÃ¢â‚¬Â on the screen, it contains little more than a few lines. We are looking for all of the excess information not directly relevant to the issue under discussion to be removed.  Â If your customization has multiple functions or include files that are not critical to the item being tested, we ask that you edit a copy of the file so that these are removed before submitting it for defect investigation. Oracle B2C Service Technical Support usually does not perform iterative testing on a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production interface as a matter of policy. Removing interface dependencies speeds up the defect research process. An additional benefit of providing a simple script, we can modify the resulting script to demonstrate the changes that are needed to get the item to function as designed and return it to you in our response. How we perform defect analysis when a customization is present"

Customizations Defect Analysis;Answer ID 6928;How is defect analysis done on customizations?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 6928'];Customization Investigation Oracle B2C Service, All versions; How we research for defects when a customization is present Our first step is to remove as much customization as possible to ensure that the core functions of item in question are working in an Ã¢â‚¬Å“out of the boxÃ¢â‚¬Â (OOTB) configuration. We check all of the dependencies for configuration such as profile, permissions and Configuration Settings required to access the underlying core functionality. Our next step is to use a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello WorldÃ¢â‚¬Â version of the customization on top of core functionality. If the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello WorldÃ¢â‚¬Â customization does not work at this point we will review all of the documentation on the intended functionality and try iterations of settings, and syntax to get the customization to operate as documented. If we encounter a resolvable error in the file submitted we will be sure to communicate that back to you as quickly as possible. If the behavior is not resolvable, we continue our research of known defects in the particular area of the product affecting your customization. If we can not validate the root cause of the reported behavior, we prepare a test case for the developer to use for their research, and it is from this step we are most likely to test conclusively for a product defect. Most of the time, our developers do not have access to your production site to reproduce the behavior. It is vital that the information you supply with your question be Ã¢â‚¬Å“transportableÃ¢â‚¬Â to other interfaces. Your simple test case saves hours or days in getting you an answer to your question.

"Customization ""Hello World"" examples";Answer ID 6929;"What are ""Hello World""Ã‚Â customization examples?";['Answer ID 7095', 'Answer ID 6499', 'Answer ID 6500', 'Answer ID 6775', 'Answer ID 6740'];  All Versions;" What is a ""Hello World"" example? For those who have some experience in scripting; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello World!Ã¢â‚¬Â is the first program or script a new user would write. It is simply a script that will display the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello WorldÃ¢â‚¬Â on the screen, it contains little more than a few lines. We are looking for all of the excess information not directly relevant to the issue under discussion to be removed. If your customization has multiple functions or includes files that are not critical to the item being tested, we ask that you edit a copy of the file so that these are removed before submitting it for defect investigation. A real world example: I have a complex webpage that contains a call to a syndicated chat widget. I suspect that the chat widget software is defective when a particular option has been set. I have two options when creating the code for defect submission: 1. Comment out everything on the page except the chat widget call in Â my original file. 2. Create a file with only the code calling the chat widget.  Â   Â  Creating ""Hello World"" examples of"" soap envelope :  Â  Â  Â  Â  A soap envelope for a contact record What is in a soap envelope?  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â How to retrieve a soap envelope  Â  Â  Â  Â  How would Â you simplify a soap envelope to submit Â for a defect investigation? Â  Â If there is an area in which you suspect defective behavior, eliminate all fields that are not needed to show the behavior. It may be that you simplify to the point of using the fields needed for the index and the field that is not acting as you believe that it should.  Â   Â  Â  Â  Â  How to ensure that timestamps records are consistent in a soap envelope and logs  Â  Â  Â  Â  Working with dates in soap envelopes Â  Â  Â   Â  Â  add-in:  Â  Â  Â  Â  When investigating for product defects involving workspace add-ins it is important that add-in code (in a Visual Studio project) be provided. Further, the Support team will need detailed steps to reproduce a reported problem using that project code. The supplied add-in code should be as simple/minimal as can be provided while still reproducing the problem, as should the workspace and related custom code/configurations involved in the test scenario. For example, all workspace rules that are not required to be present when reproducing an issue using the identified test scenario should be removed from the workspace provided to Support for the investigation.  Â  custom widget:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Custom widgets can be complex. They consist a Â group Â of files executed together.  Â  Â  Â  Â  If you suspect defective behavior, it is best to construct a customer portal page that uses only Â a single custom widget. It is acceptable to copy a reference implementation page and insert the custom widget that you need. Ideally, the ""Hello World"" example will not be using custom themes or special css formatting, as Â you are trying to isolate the issue to product code only. Be sure to run the page, using the development environment if needed and verify that the behavior is able to be reproduced. This page does not need to be promoted or deployed unless the behavior only appears in production.  Â  Â  Â  Â  When submitting the service request, please indicate the name of widget that is showing the behavior, and indicate how this widget was created. Â If the widget was created using the widget builder, you may try running the same test with the standard widget to see if you get the same behavior.  Â  Â  Â  Â  custom script:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Custom scripts may also be complex, work to isolate the example down to a small section of code including the fields, or actions that made the unexpected behavior appear consistently.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â The script should be Â working with a single type of transaction using sample data if possible. Clearly identify the action being taken and the data objects that it is expected to touch. Illustrate the expected result and the actual result that you are obtaining.  Â  hook:  Â  Â  Â  Â  There Â is usually only one hook file that can contain many hooks, it is also best to comment out all hooks in the file Â that do not influence the outcome of your exceptional behavior. If after commenting out all of the hooks the behavior continues, please explain that condition in your service request.  Â  Â  Â  Â  When you submit the request for assistance, please attach a copy of the hook file that highlights only the hook that appears to generate the behavior you are reporting.  Â  custom model:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Models files are most often connected to the use of a custom widget. Usually we see that many items have been customized in a model. To create the ""Hello World"" example we would ask that you remove all customizations in the model that are not germane to the issue. When submitting this issue, please also include a ""Hello World"" version of the customer portal page that is using the custom widget that uses the custom model showing the unexpected behavior.  Â  custom object handler:  Â  Â  Â  Â  ""Hello World"" versions of Â custom object handlers will be compact and compliant with product documentation. Restrict the code to only the data field and functions needed to display the behavior that is of concern. Please include how you would trigger the event handler and whether or not you are using Â external event suppression. Please note that you want to avoid namespace issues it will not be necessary to map the handler in the Process Designer.  Â   Â  CSS - custom style sheet:  Â  Â  Â  Style sheets can become lengthy, to submit a ""Hello World"" example, remove or comment out the styles that do not impact the behavior you are reporting, if possible it may be expedient to create a simple .css file that only contains the styles needed. Please include a screen shot with the malformed data as well.  Â   "

This enables you to see what is being done within a Site as a result of Engagement Engine activity. To Access the Inspector Tool: (found on the Engagement Engine Rules Editor ) 1. Click on the Settings button on the right side of the top of the screen bar. 2. Copy the contents of the Inspector Key window to your clipboard (copy and paste) 3. Go to your internet browser that is displaying the page on which you wish to inspect Engagement Engine activity. 4. Using web developer tools, open the browser script console. (Steps to access web developer tools can be found in your browser.The majority of browsers respond to the F12 key) 5. Paste in the Inspector key into the browser script console prompt &gt; Â and run the command. This should return Ã¢â‚¬ËœOKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and create a session cookie that enables the Inspector tool. 6. Refresh the page to activate the Inspector tool. The inspector tool will obscure part of the webpage. The Inspector tool should display on your screen when the page reloads. If the Inspector tool does not reload then check that session cookies are enabled and that an eeDebugKey session cookie has been created.  Â  The left hand side of the Inspector tool shows the Rules window. The right hand side shows a number of compressed windows that each provide further detail about Engagement Engine activity. You can expand these windows as required. The windows that are displayed within Inspector are: Rules: This provides technical information about the Rules that have run on this page in the current session. It displays a list of the Rules that have been evaluated. The list is displayed in the order that the Rules were initially evaluated on the page. If you click on the + button beside a Rule, Inspector displays further detail about that Rule including how often the Rule Runs, and what Conditions and Actions are associated with the Rule. Note: If a Rule does not run due to server-side Conditions, that Rule is not sent from the Engagement Engine server to the visitorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s browse, and so is not displayed in the Rules window. Sites: This provides information about the Site with which the current page is associated, based on Site Evaluation Order and Site Conditions. Events: This provides information about the events that have been triggered by Rules and Invites on the current page. This window updates in real-time and you can clear the contents of this window by clicking on the Clear button. Logging: This displays any log entries that have been made while on this page. This includes system log entries and any custom log entries that have been made as a result of a Rule Action. Logging data is only available from pages that have been tagged to use atgsvcs-test.js. This window updates in real-time and you can clear the contents of this window by clicking on the Clear button. Custom Data: This provides information about what data is currently held in the custom data fields. The data displayed by Inspector is live data. The information displayed in each of the windows is updated as soon as new information relevant to each window is generated. You can take a snapshot of the current data by clicking on the Snapshot button. This creates a new tab which contains all of the information in each of the windows as it was when the button was pressed. Inspector can capture a maximum of 5 snapshot tabs at any one time. If you want to pass the snapshot information to Oracle technical support, take a full screenshot and attach it to an incident.  Â   "

Assistance Request Denied email sent to customer;Answer ID 6937;My Customer received an Assistance Request Denied message from my site, but did not contact us for help. What caused this message to occur?;['Answer ID 1998', 'Answer ID 1960', 'Answer ID 9455'];   Outreach, Service, Email;"  Customers can be contacted proactively via an Outreach mailing, for example. If a mailing is sent to a customer, and the customer has an auto-response set up in their email client, such as an Out-of-Office message, then their response could be processed by the system and ultimately may not be accepted. This could include an attempt to create a new incident. First, understand there is a correlation between a contact and it's relative ""state"" or association within specific product areas. Contacts.state is used to define if the contact is for Service, Outreach, or Opportunities, or some combination of the three. Read further about this from Answer ID 1998: State field with contact and organization records. Depending on how this contacts.state value is set, this will have impacts downstream for the ability of contacts to create incidents in different channels. There are two configuration settings to review:  EGW_AUTO_CONT_CREATE - This configuration setting allows / disallows emails from contacts not already in the system, if the email is sent to a Service mailbox. With this setting, the contacts.state is also considered.

Check to make sure that a supported version of Microsoft Office has been installed correctly, or reinstall Microsoft Office as necessary. - The Â program is installed in a location other than the default C:\Program Files\ folder - An individual Office component (such as Lync or Visio) was recently upgraded on the workstation which changed the directory folder for other Office components (for example ""Office14"" to ""Office15""). In this scenario it will be necessary to uninstall the upgraded component, then uninstall and reinstall Microsoft Office in order to restore the original folder structure."

Forwarding an incident did not work;Answer ID 6954;We forwarded an incident but it was not received, why is this?;['Answer ID 31'];  Oracle B2C Service, All versions;" In such an instance, you will want to check to see if EGW_LOOP_PREVENTED_ENABLED configuration setting is set to enabled (value of ""1""). A quick explanation of this setting is as follows: EGW_LOOP_PREVENT_ENABLEDIf enabled, any email where the reply-to email address matches the reply-to email address of any mailbox in RightNow Service will be discarded and no incident will be created. In this way, the mailbox deletes any messages from itself, which can prevent continuous email loops. Default is enabled (Yes). The reason is, if you are attempting to forward to another hosted Oracle B2C Service Mailbox, as per the above setting the forward will be disregarded by techmail. The path to this setting in the console is: Configuration &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; search by Key"

Setting a specific format or mask for Custom Object text fields;Answer ID 6967;When setting up a Custom Object text field, can I require a specific format for the field?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Custom Objects, Field patterns;  Yes, you can type a regular expression string pattern to define a format that will be used to verify the contents of the field. The carat (^) character is automatically added to the start of the pattern and the dollar sign ($) character is automatically added to the end. This ensures that strings entered in the custom object's field match the entire regular expression. For example, if you want to create a field to store phone numbers in a format of 123-456-7890, enter a pattern of [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}. Refer to Regular Expressions. Another example, if you want to create a field with a Â format M732-13EN1, enter a pattern of ([A-Z][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][A-Z][A-Z][0-9]).

Testing Customer Portal problems in Reference Implementation;Answer ID 7008;How do I get access to the Customer Portal Reference Pageset, and what is it useful for?;['Answer ID 2600'];  Customer Portal, Reference Mode;" When troubleshooting Customer Portal problems, one of the best resources available to you is the Customer Portal Reference Implementation. This is the default page set, so it's a good way to see if the problem you're encountering is a system problem or a code problem. If it's a code problem, you shouldn't be able to reproduce the issue in the default environment. If you're still seeing the issue in the default environment, then you may be experiencing a system or configuration problem. To view the Reference Implementation, first go to the Customer Portal Administration Area. You can get access to it by going to https://*yoursitename*.custhelp.com/ci/admin, and logging in with your admin console credentials. Note that you will need to have Customer Portal permissions to do this. You can read up on that here: Answer ID 2600: Configuring WebDAV connection to access the Customer Portal Once you have access to the administration area, you'll want to do the following: 1. Click on the Set Environment button 2. Under ""Select the site mode you'd like to view"" select Reference 3. Click ""Set viewing mode and view the site"" Note that in the Set Environment editor you can also tell the browser to show you mobile or other pagesets if you'd like to be able to test those. Once you're in the Reference Environment, try to reproduce your problem. If you can't, that's probably a sign that a custom code change has caused the problem, and it's not a product issue. You may want to check the WebDav logs by, in the Administration Area, clicking on Logs-&gt;WebDav Logs. If you can reproduce the issue, you may be experiencing a product or configuration issue. One good place to start would be to see if any of the following have been changed recently: 1. Reports that your Customer Portal pages are running 2. Configuration Settings 3. The answer/incident you are viewing, or the contact record you are logged in as 4. For answer display problems, SLAs and Product/Category visibility  "

Debugging in Customer Portal with logMessage();Answer ID 7009;How can I debug PHP code in Customer Portal?;['Answer ID 7008'];  Customer Portal;" If you are experiencing an issue with your Customer Portal pages, one initial thing you may want to do is test in Reference Implementation. This can help you identify if the problem is code related, or product/configuration related. You can find some instructions on how to test in Reference Implementation here: Answer 7008: Testing Customer Portal problems in Reference Implementation If you are experiencing a problem with custom code, the single best way to debug the issue is to use the native logMessage() function. You can add logMessage() to your PHP scripts to either record a custom debug message: logMessage(""This is a test message""); Or to write the contents of a variable or caught exception: catch(exception $e) { logMessage($e-&gt;getMessage()); } logMessage() will traverse an array and write it to the log file, but also remember that due to lazy loading in CPHP you may not always see the contents of each array element and you'll need to explicitly write it to the log to see it: $incident = RNCPHP\Incident::fetch(123456); logMessage($incident-&gt;ReferenceNumber); Once you've added logging to your PHP script, you can view it by: 1. Going to the Customer Portal Administration Area at https://*yoursite*.custhelp.com/ci/admin 2. Logging in with your admin console credentials 3. Clicking on Logs-&gt;Debug Logs in the menu To prevent unnecessary logging, be sure to comment out or delete any logMessage() calls prior to deploying your PHP code!"

Developer Mode for Add-ins;Answer ID 7010;What developer tools are available to me for debugging add-in code?;['Answer ID 7008'];   Add-ins Oracle B2C Service;"  In addition to the add-in logging available Â once the developer access profile bit is enabled, i.e. Â Developer Mode Â profile configuration option. When enabled, this mode allows a developer to place an add-in assembly and related files in a pre-determined directory, where the Oracle B2C Service desktop will load the files. This allows developers to test add-ins without having to upload the add-ins to the server. To enable Developer Mode:  Login to Oracle B2C Service as an administrator. Click Configuration &gt;Staff Management &gt; Profiles. Click the profile you want to enable developer mode for. Click the Ã¢â‚¬ËœAdd-InsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tab and select the Developer Access checkbox     When a user logs in to an account and their profile has Ã¢â‚¬ËœDeveloper AccessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ enabled, the desktop client will attempt to load add-in DLLs from the following directory (substituting the %USERNAME% variable):  %USERPROFILE%\RightNowDev\AddIns  It is important to note that add-ins will only be loaded if the DLL is contained in a directory with the same name as the DLL. For example, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBasicSamples.dllÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ must be contained at C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\RightNowDev\AddIns\BasicSamples\BasicSamples.dll A useful trick for a developer is to add the following to the Visual Studio Post Build Events for an add-in project. This will cause your DLL to automatically be copied to the developer mode directory.  mkdir ""%USERPROFILE%\RightNowDev"" mkdir ""%USERPROFILE%\RightNowDev\AddIns"" mkdir ""%USERPROFILE%\RightNowDev\AddIns\$(ProjectName)"" copy /Y ""$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).*"" ""%USERPROFILE%\RightNowDev\AddIns\$(ProjectName)\""  While you are running an add-in in developer mode, you can do additional debugging by, in Visual Studio, selecting Debug-&gt;Attach to Process in the application menu, and then attaching to the RightNow.CX.exe process. This will allow you to follow along with your add-in execution and set breakpoints as needed."

Â Looking at your page source code, a link that looks like this will break in this way: href=""app/some/page"" Changing relative links to absolute links in your page's source code will fix the problem. For the example above, this would be the corrected href link in the source code: href=""https://site.custhelp.com/app/some/page""  Cause: In CP, this tag shows up inside the &lt;head&gt; tags on the page: &lt;base href='http://site.custhelp.com/euf/rightnow/optimized/1416115321/themes/standard/'&gt;&lt;/base&gt; This sets the base URL that all relative links are, well, relative to, so any link will follow the base href value.

Configuring Custom Objects for the Mobile Agent App;Answer ID 7028;How do I configure a custom object on the Mobile Agent App?;['Answer ID 9573'];"   Oracle Human Capital Management Cloud (Oracle HCM Cloud) Also known as Mobile Agent App / Oracle Tap   	Apple iPad with iOS6 or iOS7 operating system 	Oracle Tap iOS application (downloaded from the Apple appstore) 	Oracle B2C Service May 2014 and newer   NOTE  Oracle B2C Service Mobile Agent App (TAP) is deprecated as of May 2017";"  The Mobile Agent App allows users to interact with custom objects that you have configured in your system, including searching and viewing custom objects, and viewing custom objects associated to contacts and incidents. This answer specifies the steps to configure custom objects in the Mobile Agent App for your Oracle B2C Service instance. It is meant to be an addendum to the published Service / Mobile Agent App section of the User Guide linked here. Before You Begin:  Enable the mobile agent application for users in your environment (See the Getting Started section of the User Guide for instructions). Determine the relationship of your custom object to the standard objects used in the mobile agent application. In particular, note if the custom object is modeled as a parent or child of the related standard object, then please see the appropriate section below.   Click the next to the appropriate heading below to expand that section for viewing.  Â Steps to enable Custom Objects as a Parent of Another Object Â    Create and deploy a custom object, and add a relationship where the custom object is the parent of the related object. You can also use existing custom objects that you already set up in your Oracle B2C Service instance. Refer to the Custom Object section of the online documentation. Create a new workspace for the custom object.  a. Go to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces/Workflows  b. From the ribbon, select New Workspace  c. Find the section listing the Mobile Workspace types and find the type containing the name of your custom object.  d. The workspace designer will display a left hand side with a summary form, and child tabs along the right hand side.  e. In the workspace designer, use the Insert Fields section of the ribbon to add fields from your custom object to the layout. You can add fields from your custom object to the summary form (left hand side) or the details tab (right hand side).  f. Save your workspace.   Associate the custom object to the related object's workspace (contact, incident, or another custom object).  a. In this example, we will use the mobile incident workspace. Steps for associating to the mobile contact workspace or another related custom object are similar.  b. Go to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces/Workflows.  c. Browse through the folders to find your active Mobile Incident Workspace. Be sure to copy the workspace if you want to preserve your previous layout.   i. If this is the first time you are configuring the mobile incident workspace, you can find a default sample workspace in the Standard folder (name = Mobile Incident) and make a copy.   d. Open and edit the workspace definition for your copy.  e. In the Insert Fields section of the ribbon, you should see an association field for the related custom object.  f. Add the field to the summary or detail form of the incident. This field will allow the user to search and select from a list of custom object records to associate to the incident.  g. Save your workspace.   Create a table report to display a list of custom object records to users.   h. Go to Analytics &gt; Reports Explorer.  i. On the ribbon, select New Report and choose standard report.  j. In the data dictionary, find the table for your custom object. The name of the table will usually show the display name, followed by the folder where you created the custom object in the Object Designer followed by $ and the name of your custom object. For example, a custom object in the CO folder would appear as MyDisplayName (CO$MyCustomObject).  k. Add the desired columns to the report.  l.  Â Be sure to include the ID field from the custom object in the column set.  m.  Â Optionally, add filters if you want to constrain the data that is returned to users.  n.  Â Save your report.   Add access permissions to the custom object to the profile.  o.  Â Find the profile where you want to expose the custom object data to users. ( Note that you can have multiple profiles used across mobile users to support different layouts and permissions.) Go to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles.  p.  Â Open the profile.  q.  Â In the ribbon, select Permissions.  r.  Â Select the Custom Objects tab and find your custom object.  s.  Â Give the profile the desired permissions for the object (Create/Read/Update/Delete).   Associate your custom object workspace to the profile.  t.  Â Go to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles.  u.  Â Open the profile.  v.  Â Select the Workspaces/Workflows tab. Scroll down the table to find your custom object for mobile. The naming convention is ""CustomObjectName Mobile"".  w.  Â Use the magnifying glass to browse for the mobile custom object workspace you created above and associate it to your profile.   Associate your modified mobile incident workspace to the profile. (Follow similar steps for mobile contact workspaces).  x.  Â Go to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles.  y.

Log out and relogin anytime you change the User Interface configuration. Â    Â Steps to enable a Custom Object as a Child of Another Object   Create and deploy a custom object, and add a relationship where the custom object is the child of the related object. You can also use existing custom objects that you already set up in your Oracle B2C Service instance. Refer to the Custom Object section of the online documentation. Create a new workspace for the custom object.  a. Go to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces/Workflows  b. From the ribbon, select New Workspace  c.  Â Find the section listing the Mobile Workspace types and find the type containing the name of your custom object.  d. Â  The workspace designer will display a left hand side with a summary form, and child tabs along the right hand side.  e.  Â In the workspace designer, use the Insert Fields section of the ribbon to add fields from your custom object to the layout. You can add fields from your custom object to the summary form (left hand side) or the details tab (right hand side).  f. Â  Save your workspace.      Create a table report to display a list of custom object records to users.    a.  Â Go to Analytics &gt; Reports Explorer.  b.  Â On the ribbon, select New Report and choose standard report.  c.  Â In the data dictionary, find the table for your custom object. The name of the table will usually show the display name, followed by the folder where you created the custom object in the Object Designer followed by $ and the name of your custom object. For example, a custom object in the CO folder would appear as: Â  MyDisplayName (CO$MyCustomObject).  d. Â  Add the desired columns to the report.  e. Â  Be sure to include the ID field from the custom object in the column set.    i. Note: the ID column in the report must be set to return an integer. If you have used the labels feature on the underlying custom object definition, the ID column might return a different data type. In this case, you may need to go into the report definition and override the expression that defines the ID column in the report to include ID.id, like this: CO$MyCustomObject.ID.id.    f. Â  Add a filter to the report, so that only the child records related to the parent record are returned. In the report designer, on the ribbon select Home &gt; Filters &gt; Filter Editor from the ribbon then add a new filter.      The table below describes the filter you need to create.         Â Filter Field    Â Description                Â Type       Â Run-time selectable         Â Name       Â Use the name of the parent object.     Â e.g. Incident            Â Prompt       Â Depends on the parent object     Â Contact     Â or     Â Incident     Â or     Â Parent Custom object            Â Expression       Â Follow the expression structure:     Â ObjectFolders$MyCustomObject.ParentObject     Â e.g. CO$MyCustomObject.Incident     Â Note: when you are defining the expression for your filter in the report, you can browse the data dictionary and find the parent field from your custom object. This will insert the correct syntax into the expression to match the above example.            Â Operator    Â Equals         Â Value    Â (leave blank) will be passed at runtime         Â Data Type Â     Â Integer             g. Â  Save your report.       Add a report tab to display the list of associated custom object records in the parent object's workspace (contact, incident, or another custom object).   a. Â  In this example, we will use the mobile incident workspace. Steps for associating to the mobile contact workspace or another related custom object are similar.  b. Â  Go to Configuration &gt; Application Appearance &gt; Workspaces/Workflows.  c. Â  Browse through the folders to find your active Mobile Incident Workspace. Be sure to copy the workspace if you want to preserve your previous layout.   i Â  If this is the first time you are configuring the mobile incident workspace, you can find a default sample workspace in the Standard folder (name = Mobile Incident) and make a copy.   d. Â  Open and edit the workspace definition for your copy.  e. Â  On the right-hand side, add a tab.  f. Â  Select the tab with your mouse. On the ribbon, go to Design &gt; then select Tab Type. Set the Tab Type as 'Report'.  g. Â  Once the tab type is set to 'Report' the ribbon will show a 'Report' button. Place your mouse on the body of the child tab, then click the Report button. In the popup, find the report that you created previously. Click OK.   i. Â  Note: your report must include the ID column from the child custom object.   h. Â  Save your workspace.   Add access permissions to the custom object to the profile.  i. Â  Find the profile where you want to expose the custom object data to users. (Note that you can have multiple profiles used across mobile users to support different layouts and permissions.) Go to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles.  j. Â  Open the profile.  k. Â  In the ribbon, select Permissions.  l. Â  Select the custom objects tab and find your custom object.  m. Â  Give the profile the desired permissions for the object (Create/Read/Update/Delete).   Associate your custom object workspace to the profile.   n. Â  Go to Configuration &gt; Staff Management &gt; Profiles.  o. Â  Open the profile.  p. Â  Select the Workspaces/Workflows tab.

To test your configuration, log into the mobile agent app on your iOS device. Each time you login, it will reload the configuration changes. Log out and relogin anytime you change the User Interface configuration.    Limitations   The Mobile Agent App only supports associating custom objects to Contacts, Incidents or other custom objects. Custom Object data cannot be displayed within the mobile User Interface pages for Organization, Tasks, or Accounts.   For custom mobile reports:      The mobile application will only display a limited number of columns on the device. On the iPad, the report will show the first 8 columns. On the iPhone, the report will show the first 5 columns.     The mobile application only supports basic table formatting. Other visualizations such as charts and conditional formatting cannot be displayed.      When you create a new custom object record within the mobile application, the association with the parent object will not automatically be populated on the custom object record. The user must manually select the correct parent object to associate, as well as populate the other fields on the record. When users are creating new custom records within the child tab of the parent workspace, you should include the pick list field for the parent on the summary form of the custom object to ensure users can select this value in the UI.   Mobile Workspaces are distinct from regular workspaces in the Agent Desktop SmartClient. The Workspace Rules and Workflow frameworks are not available for mobile workspaces in the Mobile Agent App."

Referring Sites report and the Referrer Summary report;Answer ID 7030;What is the difference between the Referring Sites report and the Referrer Summary report?;['Answer ID 8512', 'Answer ID 8513'];   Oracle B2C Service version(s) Ã‚Â  November 2011 and newer;"  The Referring Sites report (ID 163) references the clickstreams table which is the raw data from the web site user activity. This data is brought into the table via the Data Query Analyzer (DQA) utility. The Referrer Summary report (ID 213) references the kf_referrer_stats table which is processed data from the clickstreams table. Â  Â  Â Logic is applied to the clickstreams data via the Dataminer utility which does some logic analysis and filtering to remove ""invalid"" information. The Dataminer utility in the analysis of referrer details does two relevant actions. 1. Â  Â The analysis only examines referrer URL's that actually have a search of some sort. Â  Â By Â  Â default only google, bing, and yahoo important referrers will be considered. Â  Â  2. Â  Â The second analysis disregards some search terms. Â  Â A lot of searches match the above criteria but do not have any search terms so these are ignored. Â  Â Search terms are also checked against the site's word lists/exclude lists which may ignore other searches. In summary, the Referrer Summary report curates information whereas the Referrer Sites reports on raw data. Â  Therefore the results for the same time period for the two reports may have significant differences. For more information, see the following published answers: Answer ID 8512: Search engines included in Referring Searches-type reports Answer ID 8513: Referring Sites report not consistent with Top Referring Searches From Google report"

Exporting archived incidents;Answer ID 7035;How do I export a copy of incidents that have been archived?;['Answer ID 7038', 'Answer ID 1234'];   Incident Archiving Oracle B2C Service, February 2015 and newer releases;  Beginning with the February 2015 release, Oracle B2C Service allows you to export copies of incidents that have been archived. Â  Up to 100 incidents can be exported at a time. To export archived incidents, start by Â accessing the archive console and performing a search to locate the incidents to be exported. For each incident listed that you wish to export, check the box to the left of the incident. Â  To select ALL incidents listed on the current page (which is up to 100), check the box at the top of the checkbox column.  To save checked incidents, click Export at the top of the page. Â  When prompted to save the file incidents.zip, click Save and choose a file location on your local system. Â  The saved file contains an XML file for each incident that you checked. Â  You can import these XML files into other data systems or examine them Â using a web browser. Additional Information: The Archiving feature allows you to remove older, resolved incidents from the database (which also aids performance since the size of your database decreases). Archived incidents are converted to an XML file that can be accessed for viewing and reference, but the content for the archived incidents is removed from the database tables. For additional information regarding archiving, refer to Answer ID 1234: Options for removing older incidents without deleting them from our site.

New in this release is the ability to filter by queue, interface, and all text contact and organization files and attributes, including state/province and country. To search or filter archived incidents, start by select the Archived Incidents option from your navigation set. Â  (See Answer ID 7038 How to access and use the archive console) Once there, click Search. Â  Â From the basic search window, click Advanced Search.   The window is organized by  Search Attributes Filter Attributes Range Custom Fields/Attributes  Search Attributes are fields that can be searched by using an asterisk for partial searches, like ""*phone*"" in the Subject field to find incidents whose subject contains the word phone. Filter Attributes are exact matches, like a product or a contact's email address.  Â Note: If your search term contains more than one word, start and end with quotes.  Â i.e. ""Test Product"" Â  Range searches are for searching date ranges on either closed date or create date. Custom Fields/Attributes are for filtering against those fields and attributes that you added to your database. Â  To filter on custom fields and attributes, you must use a special syntax of fieldname_fieldtype:value. Â  Accepted values for _fieldtype are:  _custom_str: used for fields of type _ _custom_text: used for fields of type _ _custom_range: used for specifying dates or date ranges  Here are examples of performing filters on custom fields.  _custom_str: filter on incidents where RMAReason is 'Defect'.

How to configure purging of archived incidents to match data retention requirements;Answer ID 7037;How do I configure incident archiving to permanently delete archived incidents so thatÃ‚Â we can comply withÃ‚Â company data retention policies?Ã‚Â ;['Answer ID 10013'];   Incident Archiving Oracle B2C Service,Ã‚Â February 2015 and newer releasesÃ‚Â ;"  To support your ability to comply with your company's data retention policies, beginning in the February 2015 release, Oracle B2C Service lets customers determine when archived incidents are Â permanently deleted Â or purged from the incident archive. This feature allows you to keep your archived incident data groomed and allows you to meet data retention or disposal requirements. Â  For example, your company may require that incidents older than 5 years be permanently deleted so they are irretrievable. Prior to the 19B release, the configuration setting PURGE_ARCHIVED_INCIDENTS specifies the number of days after which Solved incidents that are already archived are permanently removed from your site.  The setting is in days from the date the incident was closed. Example: PURGE_ARCHIVED_INCIDENTS = 1825 - Archived incidents will be purged 5 years after the incidents were Â closed. Note: This setting applies to interfaces.  Path to setting(s):  Select Configuration from the navigation area &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Configuration Settings &gt; and search by Key.  To change the value, select Edit Selection in the toolbar or click in the Value field, type a new value, and click Save in the toolbar. Starting from 19B release, the purge archived incident configuration has been permanently migrated to Data Lifecycle Management component. Â  For existing customers migrating from older releases, nothing explicit has to be done. The configuration values would be automatically migrated to interface specific data lifecycle policy. For new customers on 19B+ releases or new interfaces created on 19B+ release, interface specific policy will have be manually created and configured. Refer to documentation: How can we use Data Lifecycle Policy to purge (or archive)? Note: Configuring this policy and enabling it may cause data to be irretrievably deleted from the archive. Â  Please review this setting description and the documentation carefully prior to setting the policy. Â  Verify that the data in solved incidents older than the intended threshold are no longer needed by your organization.  Â The default retention period of archived incidents Â is 1825 days which equates to approximately 5 years. Also note that the archived incident retention period should be greater than your archive incident period set in the incident archive data lifecycle policy otherwise purging will not be performed."

A site (or instance)Ã‚Â can have one or multiple interfaces.";  Understanding the terminology of the structure of your site can be helpful when communicating with Â Oracle B2C Service agents. Each Organization has at least one site (or instance). The site is associated to the Organization record. For the site, there are Â interfaces. Some customers have multiple interfaces depending on the business needs.  Â There can be a variety of reasons for an organization to want multiple interfaces. Â  One example of a Â typical business need for multiple interfaces is different language requirements. Each interface may have a different language pack to accommodate various end-user audiences. Only one language pack can be applied to an interface and language packs cannot be changed. The interface has a name and vhostname.  Â The vhostname is also the url of the end-user pages. An example of how this looks is as follows: Interface name = interfacename Â  vhostname/end-user page url = http://interfacename.custhelp.com The vhostname is Â used by contacts to access your end-user pages. When submitting service requests to the Oracle B2C Service, it is important that the following details be correct for the issue being reported: 1 - site name 2 - interface name(s) 3 - vhostname Each interface has a launch url. The launch url is used by staff accounts to access your Oracle B2C Service console. Example: https://interfacename.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/interfacename.cfg/php/admin/launch.php

Fill Inbox not working even though there are no incidents in My Inbox;Answer ID 7081;Why are no incidents getting pulled into my empty inbox when clicking fill inbox?;['Answer ID 2508', 'Answer ID 2439', 'Answer ID 7036', 'Answer ID 7035', 'Answer ID 11291'];   Analytics, Fill Inbox functionality Oracle B2C Service;"  Look at the filters of the Inbox report Â the agent is using. Ensure that the filters are set to include all the unresolved and waiting Â status_types. If the filters do not include all the unresolved and waiting status_types the agent may have more incidents assigned than allowed by the profile inbox limit. However, they would not Â display in the report. For example, the status_id of an incident has a status of 'escalated' which is set to an unresolved status in the customizable menu &gt; incidents statuses. This incident would count against the inbox limit. To clarify, there are two different incident statuses:  status_id   This is the incident statuses of the customizable menus which can be found in the following path:    Application Appearance &gt; Customizable menus &gt; System Menus &gt; Incident Statuses.      status_type   This is a sub-type of the status_id. If you create a new incident status with a new label(name) Â through the above path you will find three options:    Unresolved (status_type 1 ).  Solved ( status_type 2 ).  Waiting ( status_type 3 ).     This means that you can have a status_id that has a label of escalated, closed, or any number of names but they will only have three possible status_types.       Cause: There can be a few reasons for this behavior. A common reason is because the report is not filtering correctly to display all the unresolved incidents.

Cobrowse - The customer has either closed the page, navigated away, or is experiencing network issues;Answer ID 7084;"What causes theÃ‚Â ""The customer has either closed the page, navigated away..."" message?";['Answer ID 2508', 'Answer ID 2439', 'Answer ID 7036', 'Answer ID 7035', 'Answer ID 11291'];"   Cobrowse Oracle B2C Service  Issue   V4 Session was lost on the customer side in transition from one page to another. The UI with the presentation code is no longer displayed on the customer's side; the agent sees a dialog with a message:  ""The customer has either closed the page, navigated away, or is experiencing network issues. If a cobrowsing session is still required, please ask the customer to return to the website.""    Possible Reasons:  There are a few reasons this issue might occur. Continue reading for more information on theÃ‚Â possible reasons.  1. The page belongs to a third-party website, where the CobrowseÃ‚Â Launcher script is not deployed by design.";" make configuration changes in V4 configuration in the Admin console (restrict ICB URLs to show which domains and/or pages should be supported; redirects to other pages will open a new browser tab and will not disrupt active sessions). 2. The page belongs to a domain which should be supported, but the script is not present on the page due to deployment misconfiguration. Session cannot be initiated on this page - UI is not visible, and does not come up after the Ctrl-Enter keyboard combination, or clicking the link which initiates the cobrowsing session. Resolution: The Â Cobrowse Launcher package should be deployed on all pages where the session should be supported. 3. The browser is Internet Explorer Â and the session was lost because the two pages belong to different security zones (Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Security). Session is lost in transition from a less-restrictive zone like 'Trusted sites' or 'Intranet' to a more restricted zone like 'Internet' or 'Restricted'. Non-IE browsers like Google Chrome do not lose session in the same transition.  Resolution: All the domains in the session should belong to the same security zone in Internet Explorer. 4. The tester's browser is specifically restricted to disallow localStorage, cookies, and any other means of storing the session information. Resolution: Allow localStorage access in the browser configuration."

Note: These settings apply to interfaces. Default values for new sites on version February 2015 and newer: New sites will have incident archiving and archived incident purging enabled by default. Â  The affected functionalities and their default values are:  Days after which incident is archived: 365 Days after which archived incident is purged: 1825  This means that 365 days after an incident is Solved, it will be automatically archived, and 1,825 days after an incident is Solved, the archived incident Â will be automatically permanently deleted from the archive. Default values for upgraded sites: Sites upgraded from an older Â version to February 2015 or greater will have the following default values:  Days after which incident is archived: Prior value is retained Days after which archived incident is purged: Prior value is retained  This means if incident archiving or purging of archived incidents was enabled for your interfaces prior to the upgrade, then they will remain enabled with the same value specified as it was prior to the upgrade. Â  If they were disabled prior to the upgrade, then they Â will still be disabled after the upgrade. Â  Note: Settings for both archiving of incidents and purging of archived incidents are expected to be adjusted and controlled by the customer to fit their specific data retention policies or requirements.  Â These settings are the customerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s responsibility, as well as the incidents that are archived and/or purged. Â  It is recommended that incident archiving remain enabled to ensure data stores are cleansed of unnecessary data and to maintain optimal performance.

The default message displayed is ""The instance of RightNow CX has been locked due to user inactivity."" You can customize the text in order to reflect the site name by editing the Message Base that controls this message: INST_RN_CX_LOCKED_DUE_INACTIVITY_MSG. In this way your agents will know Â from what site the message comes Â and what password has to be introduced in order to allow them to continue their activities. The change Â might not reflect immediately Â on the first login of the agents Â because, unlike other message bases, Â the change must be downloaded from the server before it will show up on the agent's workstation. Cause: A ""console locked"" message appears on the Agent Desktop after a short period of inactivity on the site. It requires that you input your password to regain access to the console. Â You can add Â the site name to the message to allow agents to use the correct password when they are logged into different sites at the same time.  "

Stopping an Object Event Handler from running;Answer ID 7125;How do I stop an Object Event Handler from running?;['Answer ID 8392'];  August 2013Ã‚Â and newer releases;" To stop an Object Event Handler from running you need to perform the following steps: 1.) Go to the Configuration-&gt;Site Configuration folder and open the Process Designer. 2.) Select the object that the event handler you wish to stop executing is associated with. 3.) Set the selectors for Create, Update, Â and Destroy to [No Value] for the event handler you wish to disable. 4.) Save the Process Designer workspace. 5.) Click the Deploy ribbon button. Notes: It is always best to disable any object event handler before deploying any custom objects that the object event handlers are associated with. This will help prevent the event handler from arriving at an undefined state if there are errors due to missing fields or changes in the custom fields for the custom object in question. The event handler test harness should conform to best practices and the test step should always be performed again before reattaching the event handler to the redeployed object. Additional Resources: For further information on best practices, please see Answer ID 8392: SPM/Process Designer Best Practices."

Security token in survey URL;Answer ID 7141;Why isÃ‚Â there no security token in my survey's URL?;['Answer ID 5168', 'Answer ID 4833'];  Surveys; In Â August 2012 Â and later releases, we added a security token into a Â survey's URL to Â prevent someone from changing the survey_id in the URL and loading other surveys from the site. This indicates Â every survey should not be accessed without a Â security token in the URL. If a survey is identified Â with no security token, Â it is likely that Â survey Â was created in a version prior to August 2012. This is to ensure that any survey created in prior releases would still load (without the security token). Â  Â This Â prevents broken Â links that may Â have been published (or exist in emails sent to contacts). Â   Â Whether or not it is required depends on the survey's created date.

CX Administrator guide to enable Visitor Browser History;Answer ID 7167;How do I get started using Oracle B2C Service Visitor Browser History(vbh) feature?;['Answer ID 5168'];   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â  November 2014 and newer using the Enhanced Console Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â  Oracle B2C Service Chat must be enabled Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â  Engagement Engine must be enabled;  In the November 2014 release, Oracle introduced a new feature: Visitor Browser History. Visitor Browser History allows a Chat Agent to see where the end-user has been on the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website, prior to chatting with the agent, within a current browser session. The Chat Agent is provided a list of the historical URLs within the chat session with the end-user. The Chat Agent can click the URLs to see the pages, or simply view the list of URLs which includes the Page Name. This gives the agent immediate visual insight into the end-userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s page visits and the actions that led up to the need for agent assistance, without the agent having to ask the end-user. Thus creating a better customer user experience and reducing chat handle times. The attached Â document is designed to help CX Administrators enable Visitor Browser History on Â November 2014 and newer Â sites. Additional information is available in the 'Chat session workspace tabs' section in online documentation for the version your site is currently running.
